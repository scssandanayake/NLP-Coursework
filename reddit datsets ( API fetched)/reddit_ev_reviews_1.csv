Californians Are Ashamed' To Drive Teslas,,4990,1778,1726510216,"I happily own an Ioniq 5, don't even know the name of the Hyundai CEO and hope it stays that way. | I love my Tesla, but I can't stand Elon anymore. Nearly all CEO's are assholes, but most of them don't make it obvious to the public. He's taken it up to a whole new level. | [deleted] | Knowing when to shut up is an important lesson you learn as you get older. Elon is one of the biggest examples of what happens when you don't know that.

I'm not gonna act like every CEO is a pleasant person. I'm aware not buying Tesla doesn't only impact him, but the people that work for him as well. 

But yeah, a lot of the dirty laundry he's aired out doesn't really motivate me to want to buy one of his cars. Especially when there are feasible alternatives now. | Has a CEO ever taken a brand down faster? Years ago, I was really impressed, now I question how I missed the mark. | Based on the number of Teslas driving around Bay Area and LA, can't say many are ""ashamed"" of their cars. 

This might be a too-online-white-guy kind of sentiment. | Lmao I see so many cybertrucks in Los Angeles, I hate Elon just as much as the next sane person but there clearly are a lot of people who don't give a fuck lol | Unpopular opinion:

Buyers Are Avoiding Teslas Because Elon Musk Has Become So Toxic,,4682,1795,1712014010,"I have a conservative neighbor. I kinda love him to death, but he says really dumb shit from time to time.

Anyway, I was walking to my mailbox and he stops by to say hey. Completely unprompted he says

Sister let me tell you something. I never want to own an electric vehicle and the democrats will never get me to give up my gas vehicle.

I looked behind me and all around and I was the only one on the street. He was indeed talking to me.

Anyway, it is really weird Elon has aligned himself with these peopleâ€¦ | Tesla owner. I'll never buy a combustion car again, but Musk's behaviour has also convinced me that I'll never buy another Tesla. 

I got my car in 2022 before he went all the way off the deep end, which also means by the time I'm looking to upgrade basically every other manufacturer will have an option I can look at.

It really is sad how badly he's ruined his legacy, and honestly, I can't even understand why he did so. | That's me. Not sure what to get but it won't be Tesla due to musk. New Rivians looks nice. | Just to prove he is the moron he really is.  His rise in power and money were because of ""liberals"" who wanted cars that would detach our dependency on oil and now he has completely lost that support.  

This clown is the only person to go from the real life version of Tony Stark to Zorg from the 5th Element. | Legit was looking at a Tesla, but I do not want to give my money to Musk, so it worked out because I'm starting to be fascinated by the Ioniq5 | I can appreciate what Tesla has done for the EV movement, but I will NEVER buy one while he is able to profit from it. | A much better, more thorough, article on the subject over at [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/would-be-tesla-buyers-snub-company-musks-reputation-dips-2024-04-01/).

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its Trust & Like and Consideration indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples' opinion of a brand and if they'd consider buying their product.

They don't appear to draw a direct line to Musk's behavior, unclear if there's a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they'd have questions about any other auto executives â€” could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I'd still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they're generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car. I like buttons, think full self driving is a pipe dream until we have general AI, every Tesla I've ridden in was uncomfortable, and every friend who owns one has had multiple dumb problems with their car.

But Musk's behavior does give me greater confidence in my position. | It definitely sucks to always have to defend loving your car while simultaneously hating Elon Musk. | I leased a Model 3 in 2020 and liked it a lot. I planned to buy an EV at the end of the lease. I probably would have got a Model 3 if Musk hadn't gone off the rails. 

I like my EV6. | I used to be a huge Elon fanboy in the early days of Tesla/SpaceX (who wasn't), so much that I jokingly had a picture of him on my bedroom wall. I was a young engineer and this guy was fucking Tony Stark.

Those days are long gone. I'm in the Tesla target market and wouldn't consider a Tesla solely because of Musk's ignorance and toxicity.",electricvehicles,,Tesla,Reddit

US Postal Service says it is going electric despite Trump,,3582,384,1733929344,"Some relevant stats. 83% of USPS LLVs are used in cities.

Hell, the longest USPS route in the country is only 195.2 miles. | We call our USPS the black smoke monster when it rolls through. You can hear it from down the street. The actual postman is awesome and we leave him some water in the summers, but he drives a junker. I'd love it if he had something more modern. | On a fleet like that the payback would be huge. Very little downtime due to maintenance. | All day these vehicles stop and go. It's the exact vehicle that should be electric, or at a minimum a hybrid. | Weird. Isn't DeJoy one of Trump's cronies? | They're already electric where I live (Washington state) but they look like just regular vans. They're not the Oshkosh ones and I dont think they're Rivian - not sure who manufacturers them. 

If they didn't say on them they were electric vehicles and I hadn't seen them tearing up their lot to put in charging stations I wouldn't know they were electric. | Just take an old one and a new one to the White House for a photo op. Have them drag race and let him sit in one. Give him a lolly and promise to brand them with his initials or something.  He'll empty the coffers on them. | Route based vehicles should all be electric | Heads will roll!

During Trump ERA #1, Le Grande Orange put in place a Monkey-in-a-Suit to run the USPS who immediately made the decision to dismantle million dollar mail sorters in order to, I guess, slow down the mail. 

Now that Trump ERA #2 is approaching, one thing we can be sure of is a much more complete dismantling of USPS just so that the fat cats can make bank on the more expensive private delivery services.

California May Do EV Rebates Under Trump Just Not For Tesla,,2503,963,1732563150,"> Yet his office told Bloomberg today that Tesla will be excluded from this new proposal to allow rivals to catch up. The rebates would come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

This is interesting... could tesla sue to be included?
How would they make it work? | California needs to get its electricity costs under control first.

I want to like an EV.  I had a PHEV for a year that I ended up lemon-lawing because it won't go, but I ran it on electric 80% of the time before it died.  I like the driving experience of EVs, I like that they're zero-emission, I like that I can charge them at home or at work and park in EV charger spots, I like that they're quieter than gas cars.

But with electricity rates at $0.60/kwh vs. gas prices of $4.80/gal, it doesn't make economic sense anymore.  A typical EV sedan gets about 4 mi/kwh for a driving price of $0.15/mi; a typical ICE sedan gets 40 mpg for $0.12/mi.  A minivan or midsize SUV might get 1.5 mi/kwh for $0.40/mi, vs. 20 mpg for $0.24/mi (actually hybrid Siennas get almost twice that).  In no world does it make economic sense to buy an EV, particularly since they lose Express Lane benefits in Sept 2025.

The big-three investor owned utilities are single-handedly killing California's push to go green.  Until somebody can reign in PG&E consumers will continue to use gasoline for their cars and natural gas to heat their homes. | I'm pretty sure laws targeting one specific company are illegal; or at the very least, will basically cause it to get wrapped up in the courts for years | Looks like literally nobody read about this.

It would be based on market share, not targeted towards a specific company. The idea is to boost the smaller market share companies before they get a foothold.

The previous federal tax credit had a cap by number of units as well. Tesla and GM used up their share, other companies didn't.

Salt water warning,,2340,768,1727554952,"There are videos on YouTube about this Norwegian shop fixing Tesla batteries that were flooded and failed, and a common issue is the umbrella valves that lose sealing ability. I wonder if those valves play a part in this. | FYI we have a saltwater flooded X in our workshop. We haven't pulled the pack for testing yet but it has consistently not been on fire for quite some time. | Salt water ~~conducts~~  is a pretty good conductor of electricity, if it gets in your battery pack then it's effectively shorting it out, which generally ends badly. | Odd that the water isn't even up to the undercarriage yet........

Edit: is this a Model X? | Fuck now media is gonna use this to make EVs look bad | Honestly this doesn't make sense that EVs are catching on fire after exposure to salt water.

But they can't do it without steady growth of scale and they can't do it alone. They all have to play by the same rules.


Personally, I want to keep the EV credits and regulations. But I also want them to have a receding horizon.

California will require EV charging for all new residential units in 2026,,2273,250,1734545829,"Looks like a dedicated outlet requirement of 20 amp at 240v.  That's only slightly more than a wall outlet in wire size so not too bad. | ""For any new unit with a parking space in a multi-family development (apartments/condos), at least one of the parking spots must be EV Ready. An EV Ready space is defined as having at least a ***240V/20A outlet*** or charger for EV charging""

  
This is really not that onerous. It's bare minimum. | So, a 240V outlet in the garage? | It'll be interesting to see how the ""and must retrofit into parking spaces if anything requiring a building permit is done to parking spaces"" plays out.

We have a similar requirement locally, and you really ended up in a stupid position fairly often.

You want to modify a parking spot (add a fence, change the curb/landscaping layout, etc) and boom, now you need to have EV chargers on some of those spots.

But those spots are the furthest out from the facility!  Running a conduit out to it will cut across the entire parking lot.  Meaning you need a permit on all of them, and have to update it to all of them.

So, a $15k change to a few parking spots 200' out from the building just to help traffic flow has now cascaded into a $220k cavalcade of redoing your entire parking lot.

Thus, the new trend is to just let those parking spots crumple, or pull the permits for removing them, and turning them into dirt that you just so happen to be able to park on. | Good to hear the 7 new houses they allow to be built each year will have this. | Good!

This is a great feature that will reduce people's hesitancy to buy a ZEV that isn't going to add any noticeable cost to the price of a house.

I converted a 60-year-old tractor to electric,,1799,101,1728443958,"Hey, fellow EV enthusiasts! Thought I'd share a project I've been working on for the past year. If you want to see how I built it, [check out my full video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iEUp5Z1aNw)

My friend who owns a farm asked if I'd be interested in converting their old Massey Ferguson 65 to electric, as they're also big EV fans (I built a portable 1kW solar setup for them as well). I removed the engine and swapped it out for a 28kW brushed DC motor, and I built a 3kWh battery pack using second-hand li-ion cells from Battery Hookup. The motor controller is an Alltrax 400A one, and I designed a custom throttle and electronic clutch pedal situation to make it intuitive for those who are used to driving ICE tractors. This certainly isn't suitable for spending 8 hours a day plowing fields or anything like that, but that wasn't the requirement. We simply wanted to give new life to an old tractor that wasn't being used. It works great for hauling trailers and wagons through the fields while workers harvest tomatoes, pumpkins, etc. 

I'm currently working on a custom screen to display the power consumption, speed, and remaining battery percentage. From my initial tests, it lasts about 2 hours driving around on dirt and gravel, which is perfect for ~90% of the use cases. For the times when this tractor is unsuitable, they can bring out the diesel tractor.

I'm planning to do some more EV conversions in the future. I'd love to do a larger tractor with an enclosed cab and put a Nissan Leaf motor in. I also want to design a better battery because this one was a nightmare to assemble. It all looked fine in CAD but trying to install threaded rods with multiple nuts spaced along them was so tedious and finicky. | Man you even put in a random clank to really give it that authentic feel. | What a natural, tractors need torque, which electric has abundance of. | That is so cool. | this is cool. keep us posted for the updates. i wanna see how it fares when doing actual farm work. | Somewhere some old coot is fuming | This is awesome! My partner and I have a couple acres, and I've been thinking about converting a small tractor, mostly for moving dirt/mulch/sifting rocks/etc. I've seen a couple tractor conversions popping up lately.

It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control.

I have to rent a car while mine is repaired and Enterprise, Hertz, and all the Turo listings in my area want over $100/day for a base M3. The same price they're charging for luxury SUVs with an MSRP over $60k.

Opening a Front Door with No Power

To open a front door in the unlikely situation when Model Y has no power, pull up the manual door release located in front of the window switches.

What I find interesting, at least for the Model Y, is the manual says for the rear doors, not all Model Y vehicles are equipped with a manual release. Then goes on to explain a convoluted process for manually opening the back doors, which, for sure, someone would not figure out in a panic setting:  

1. Remove the mat from the bottom of the rear door pocket.

2. Press the red tab to remove the access door.

3. Pull the mechanical release cable forward.

Everyone should have an emergency window breaker in the car if a car becomes submerged; however, I cannot find anything that confirms the Tesla has tempered glass windows in the back passenger seat.

It's also a failure and a loss for government regulators. I'm sure this was a fight at some point in the development process and some federal regulatory agency ended up giving in.

If you have a Model 3 or a Model Y, here's the info from the online manual for how to open the rear doors if the electrical system fails. You might want to train by going through the motions once or twice and do the same for your loved ones who travel in the back seat frequently.

Apparently some Model 3 and Model Y's don't even have a manual release for the back seat. I wouldn't want to be the driver who pulled my manual release and got out but then failed in extracting the back seat passengers. Heck, I'd practice climbing over the front seats and out the front doors if my Tesla didn't have the rear seat manual release system.

Highlights:

>Trump's response stunned several of the executives in the room overlooking the ocean: You all are wealthy enough, he said, that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House. At the dinner, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens ofPresident Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.

>Giving $1 billion would be a deal, Trump said, because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him, according to the people.

>Trump's remarkably blunt and transactional pitch reveals howthe former president is targetingthe oil industry to finance his reelection bid. At the same time, he has turned to the industryto help shape his environmental agenda for a second term, including the rollbacks of some of Biden's signature achievements on clean energy and electric vehicles.

>Despite the oil industry's complaints about Biden's policies, the United States is now producing more oil than any country ever has, pumping nearly 13 million barrels per day on average last year. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year.

>Yet oil giants will see an even greater windfall â€” helped by new offshore drilling, speedier permits and other relaxed regulations â€” in a second Trump administration, the former president told the executives over the dinner of chopped steak at Mar-a-Lago.

>Trump vowed at the dinner to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports â€” a top priority for the executives, according to three people present. You'll get it on the first day, Trump said, according to the recollection of an attendee.

\[...\]

>At the dinner, Trump also promised that he would scrap Biden's mandate on electric vehicles â€” mischaracterizing ambitious rules that the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized, according to people who attended. The rules require automakers to reduce emissions from car tailpipes, but they don't mandate a particular technology such as EVs. Trump called them ridiculous in the meeting with donors.

>The fossil fuel industry has aggressively lobbied against the EPA's tailpipe rules, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto gas car ban. The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.

>Although the repeal of the EPA rule would benefit the fossil fuel industry, it would probably anger the auto industry, which has invested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.

>Automakers need some degree of regulatory certainty from government, said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and other car companies.

>What has emerged instead is a wholesale repealâ€¦ and then reinstatementâ€¦ and then repeal again of regulations every four or eight years, Bozzella said in an email. | It's fascinating how much they can't bring themselves to say fossil fuels and acknowledge the pollution burning it causes. | [deleted] | EVs should be widely supported by Republicans for the following reasons.

2. They're creating jobs as it's a new industry and new industries create jobs.

3. They save money.  Obviously there are exceptions, but generally speaking if you compare a $40k SUV to a $40k EV, you're going to save money and it can be a considerable amount.

4. Energy independence.  Constant bitching about energy and oil and how we have to work with the Middle East for oil.  How global politics can effect gas/oil prices.  Guess what?  Energy in the US is created in the US.

5. Energy independence to the extreme:  Solar. You can't make your own gasoline at home but you sure as shit can put up a solar array and start producing power at home.  Solar in the US is unnecessarily bureaucratic and complicated by comparison to most parts of the world.  In places like Australia who have very high cost of living, they still have MUCH cheaper solar because they don't make it some insane process.  It's fucking mounting panels on a roof and connecting a few electrical devices.  It's pretty damn simple.

Coming home from Minnesota, I stopped to charge in Osage Beach, MO, right in the heart of AECI's territory. I know them, because I often pull up[Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)to see how things are progressing (just in the last year, I've noticed CAISO has brought their generation emissions down substantially, remaining mostly ""green"" throughout the day), and AECI is usually a dark spot in the middle of the country due to their high reliance on coal generation.

That got me thinking: how ""dirty"" is charging my car in central Missouri when coal plants are belching out their maximum output and the region's grid is averaging 750g/kWh of CO2?

I did some quick back-of-the-napkin math and found that my old ICE would put out about 9000g of CO2 for every 25 miles I drove. My Tesla? Assuming it consumes 6.25kW to go the same 25 miles, then at 750g/kWh, that's 4600g of CO2 -- half of my old car's emissions.

And that's in one of the dirtier regions of the country. When I charge overnight at home (in the SPP region) where wind makes up \~65% of generation and the carbon intensity of our generation mix is 250g/kWh, that's 1500g of CO2 per 25 miles, or like 17% of the emissions of my old ICE. If I were to charge my car in Seattle, which has a yearly average of 24g/kWh of CO2 emissions thanks to their heavy use of hydropower, I'd be generating 150g of CO2 to drive 25 miles.

I'm not just ""moving"" the emissions from the tailpipe to a smokestack. Even in a worst-case scenario, I'm cutting them in half, and it just gets better from there. And that's before you factor in all those generator interconnection queues I mentioned above\*, which are nearly exclusively renewable generation sources (few energy investors are finding that it pencils out to build new fossil fuel plants, since renewables are so cost-competitive these days and prices are continuing to fall).

\*Reference to a previous post, where I mentioned that here in the Midwest/Great Plains (in the [SPP](https://spp.org/) ISO's footprint), there are 25GW of committed [Generator Interconnection Agreements](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTBlNTNiODQtNjg4MC00NTMyLWFmZGUtZDhmOGMxYzIxODhlIiwidCI6IjMyMzA5MjZhLTcxYjctNDM3MC1hMTM3LTE5N2JhZGMwNjZhMiJ9) and another 85GW of generation sources under study coming online in the next 6 years. For reference, our entire peak load in our region is 56GW. So enough generation to replace almost 50% of our peak load (and more than 50% of our average load) is coming online this decade, and enough to almost triple our current peak load is either committed or under study. | It's confirmation bias, as least in my area. Friends and family that don't have one, don't want to spend the money on one, or equate EVs with a certain political viewpoint, are justifying their viewpoints with misinformation. | Like the guy who tried to tell me a Prius' carbon footprint was more than a Hummer.  Yeah maybe, until you put them on the road and actually drive | Just an hour ago I was talking with someone in a discord server from America who said that EVs pollute more than combustion once you factor EVERYTHING in from the ore in the ground to driving around. Started talking about how production still results in net positive and it's like... Yeah? So what does that make combustion? He said make it net negative and... Drive hybrids... With fuels made from plants... Because plants will absorb carbon dioxide?


I was so confused. | [deleted] | I can't even count the amount of times I've seen anti-EV propaganda on other subs on Reddit, and it's not always Americans (though probably more often than not). I've posted the EPA's EV myths page many times that refute the same tired arguments (mostly that EVs pollute more than ICE cars since they emit more in their manufacture and because electricity generation is primarily fossil fuel based in the US). | 
* These are articles I have read and saved over the years. They are what convinced me the overwhelming evidence is EVs are healthier.

> Ford CEO Jim Farley says he doesn't want to give up the Xiaomi Speed Ultra 7 he's been driving for the past half year.

> ""I don't like talking about the competition so much, but I drive the Xiaomi,"" Farley said while speaking to the British presenter Robert Llewellyn on ""The Fully Charged Podcast."" The podcast, which Llewellyn hosts, aired on Monday.

> ""We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up,"" Farley continued.

> The SU7 is Xiaomi's maiden electric vehicle. The Chinese tech giant produces three versions of the car: SU7, SU7 Pro, and SU7 Max. Farley didn't specify which version he was driving.

> ""It's fantastic. They sell 10,000, 20,000 a month. They're sold out for six months,"" Farley said of Xiaomi's success with the SU7 earlier in the interview.

> ""You know, that is an industry juggernaut and a consumer brand that is much stronger than car companies,"" he added.

> Representatives for Farley at Ford didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.

> The popularity of the SU7 has come at a cost for Xiaomi. When Xiaomi reported its second-quarter earnings on August 21, its EV branch posted an adjusted loss of $252 million.

> That means Xiaomi lost about $9,200 for each of the 27,307 SU7s it shipped that quarter. The SU7 is sold at a base price of 215,900 yuan, or about $30,000, and is available only in China.

> A spokesperson for Xiaomi told BI's Matthew Loh in August that the company was looking to lower its production costs by increasing the scale of its EV arm.

> ""In addition, Xiaomi's first EV is a pure electric sedan, and its investment cost is relatively high, so it will take some time to digest this part of the cost,"" the spokesperson told Loh.

> These aren't the first comments Farley or his fellow Ford executives have made about the scale or progress of China's EV industry.

> After visiting China in May, Farley told a Ford board member that China's auto industry was an ""existential threat,"" The Wall Street Journal reported in September.

> In early 2023, Farley and his chief financial officer, John Lawler, were in China when they tested out an electric SUV made by the state-owned automaker Changan Automobile, the Journal reported.

> The report said the pair was impressed by the quality of the Chinese-made EVs.

> ""Jim, this is nothing like before,"" Lawler told Farley, according to the Journal. ""These guys are ahead of us.""

> Farley's comments have come as Chinese automakers continue to dominate the global EV market. Data compiled by the technology firm ABI Research for Business Insider shows Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.

> Competing with rivals such as Xiaomi will be critical for Ford as it formulates its approach to the EV market.

> Ford posted a big earnings miss in the second quarter of the year, sending the company's stock tumbling. The company's earnings per share came in at $0.47, below analyst estimates of $0.68. Its profitability for the quarter was weighed down by its EV segment, which saw a $1.14 billion loss amid slowing demand. Ford's third-quarter earnings are due on October 28.

> In August, Lawler told reporters that Ford was changing its EV strategy and would replace its planned electric SUVs with hybrid models instead. The move is set to cost Ford nearly $2 billion.

> Ford shares are down nearly 9% year to date. | If you listen to guys like Farley and Carlos Tavares of Stellantis you can tell they're extremely concerned. 

While North America drags their feet on electrification the far east has embraced it and supported it. In markets where they go head to head, the Chinese are killing it on price and technology. Even here tariffs and protectionism will only be able to hold off the onslaught for so long. Remember when no one in America took Toyota, Honda, and Nissan's cheap efficient cars seriously?

These CEOs all know this, but because they're beholden to a board of directors, stock holders, dealers, enthusiasts, reluctant buyers, etc they're stuck having to pussyfoot around the topic. 

Remember they're not starting to design cars for Boomers anymore. Most of them have bought their last car. Even GenX is a relatively small market. They're really designing cars now for Millennials and GenZ. Combined they will be the majority car buyers starting in the next 5-10 years.

The ""losing $9200 per vehicle"" is mostly nonsense. Slanted articles regularly say things like this. They are including capital investments.

And the tech and interior inside is fantastic.

The $9200/unit loss' is meaningless. If these vehicles could be imported to the U.S. with no restrictions (which we all know is a pipe dream, but just for the sake of this conversationâ€¦), it could EASILY sell at double its current $30k USD price, thus making a massive per-unit PROFIT.

Because the transmission was computer controlled, I couldn't shift it into neutral, so the dealership had to go through about 10 different tow truck companies to get it towed out of my parking pad. They had to drag it out.

Essentially, the main computer entirely died, replacing that fixed everything, completely covered by factory warranty but gave me a rather large scare about just how computer controlled these EVs are. | Mechanical breakdowns on EVs will be less than ICE in every respect except software. 

The critical software on ICE cars is really mature, much simpler, and limp modes well established.

The amount of critical software control in EVs is higher, more complex, and less established. That will be fixed eventually but car companies are just shit at software, EV or ICE.

We're going to keep seeing small bugs bricking EVs for several more years before all the car companies learn better software architecture. | In other news, water is wet and the sun keeps spinning. More at 11.

Baffled: Japanese take apart BYD electric car and wonder: 'How can it be produced at such a low cost?',,1322,835,1729803004,"Lol, this is the question GM engineers asked about Japanese cars in the 80s. | As a few other comments were saying, vertical integration can help a lot. Last weekend, I was talking to a friend who works in an experimental engineering division of a major automaker. They are acutely aware of new-generation competitors who engineer far more of their vehicles in-house.


As such, some legacy automakers are now in various stages of replicating the engineering style of Tesla and Chinese EV companies. This will require building up a lot of resources to replace engineering that was typically offloaded to suppliers. But it could yield flexible yet standardized EV platforms that are easily retooled for different vehicles. Andintegrated components lead to shorter development times and easier vehicle-wide OTA updates. | They make their own batteries. major cost driver on EVs. This is probably the biggest factor.

They are innovative, driven, hard-working and genuinely motivated to make great products. The idea of locally sold products being lower quality is ridiculous. The Chinese consumer is incredibly sophisticated and value driven, but demands high-content and innovation. 

The Chinese have stopped buying foreign cars because their domestically produced cars are better and/or offer better value.

I started ringing alarm bells about this 10 years ago within the western industry in Europe and the US. The Chinese are going to be the dominant global automakers of the future and they'll deserve it because no western automaker is able or willing to give them any real competition. 

While we debate EV or not, they are just making it happen. No reliance on foreign oil. Building infrastructure and nuclear power plants along with other renewables. High speed rail. Traveling to china used to be like a Time Machine to the past, now it's like visiting the future. 

Are there amazingly bad things about China? Absolutely yes. Are there amazingly good things? Absolutely yes. Cars are just one aspect.

White teslas have become synonymous with bad driving. 

It used to be BMW, but now it's all Tesla's, and there are so many shitty drivers here. 

I'm not surprised by this study. People get into new tech car and expect it to butter their toast for them. | The study is an iSeeCars.com study which is just a count of deaths per model. Causes aren't factored in the list:

https://www.iseecars.com/most-dangerous-cars-study#v=2024

iSeeCars.com analyzed fatality data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of model year 2018-2022 cars with car crashes that resulted in at least one occupant fatality to identify the most dangerous vehicles on U.S. roads today.

New cars are safer than they've ever been, said Karl Brauer, iSeeCars Executive Analyst. Between advanced chassis design, driver assist technology, and an array of airbags surrounding the driver, today's car models provide excellent occupant protection. **But these safety features are being countered by distracted driving and higher rates of speed, leading to rising accident and death rates in recent years.**

iSeeCars identified models with a fatal accident rate at least two times higher than the average car, with the five deadliest vehicles over four times the average. **The Hyundai Venue, Chevy Corvette, and Mitsubishi Mirage are the three deadliest cars on American roads,** based on fatal accidents per mile traveled. The Porsche 911, Honda CR-V Hybrid, Tesla Model Y, Mitsubishi Mirage G4, Buick Encore, Kia Forte, and Buick Envision round out the top 10 deadliest vehicles, with fatal accident rates between 2.8 and 4.9 times the average. | Someone better with numbers than I am please explain how Tesla has an average of 5.6, while they quote the S at 5.8 and the Y at 10.6. There is no way enough Model 3s were sold to offset those other two numbers, and I doubt the 3 was 1.x that would be needed to bring the average down. 

These numbers are out to lunch. | People die more in faster cars, that's my suspicion. | For the record this likely does not at all represent the actually safety of the cars. People who buy teslas like to drive them fast, which obviously increases the likelihood of crashes | There's something fishy here.

The Model Y and the Model 3 (especially pre-Highland) are very similar -- same drivetrain, likely similar behavior in emergency handling situations, and probably similar crash dynamics. Yet the Model 3 is somewhere below 4.3 fatalities per billion miles (it's not on the list), whereas the Y is 10.6/billion miles.

I can think of a couple of things here: perhaps Y drivers are more likely to carry passengers who might also die, and this chart counts vehicle-miles rather than passenger-miles (since that's harder to track). In any event it's remarkable that the 3 is so much safer than the Y, which points to it being a driver-behavior factor rather than something about the car itself. | iSeeCars.

I'm just going to say it: 90% of you aren't going to keep your EVs long enough to worry about extending your batteries' healths this much. ,"Very, very few people keep their cars long enough that anyone should be considerably worried about their battery's longevity.

Cars are tools used to enrich aspects of your life. Treat them as such and stop stressing about SoH so much.

Edit: commenters' reading comprehension is not looking great.

Edit 2: since no one wants to really read I'll explain it: I bought a used 2019 Leaf S with ~6k miles on it, 40kWh battery. I opportunity charge at home and work, put around 175 miles on it per week. Granted I don't really fast charge, but my car isn't really designed to do this often like many of ya'lls cars do. With very little consideration I have managed to go from 100% SoH to 86% (just checked LeafSpy) in four years and 50k miles. I will drive this car in to the ground. If I hit the SoH until it was 50% it would STILL serve my uses. That may be in 7-8 more years from now bringing its total life span to 13 years. This car will have gotten me to work and made me so much money in 13 years I'll hardly care what a dealer will give me for it. 

Y'all gotta stop worrying about your batteries so much.",1296,552,1726094535,"While that's maybe true it is good to take good care of your things. Idk maybe some ppl are pulling their hair out about battery health more than they should but I think most EV owners are environmentally conscious and want to both protect their investment and make sure their vehicle is still viable to be used by someone, even if it isn't them, 10/15/20 years down the road, rather than being e-waste. 

Even if I knew I'd sell a car in a year or that I was going to give it away or something I'd still want to take care of it. | Battery care is really simple:


1. Do whatever you need to do to make the trips you want to make.


2. Don't leave a battery sitting above 80% state of charge without a good reason, especially if it's hot.



3. Don't leave a battery sitting below 10% state of charge without a good reason, especially if it's cold.



4. Don't habitually run your battery down to zero.


That's it. | I kept my last three cars for 8-10 years and put over 200K miles on each of them.  I think I'm in that 10% that is going to keep my EV long enough to worry about it.

Aside from that, people that don't keep their cars long trade them in or sell them, and someone else gets their use after that, and maybe someone else after that.  The better the care the car gets, the longer it could ultimately last. | Should people avoid abusing their batteries?

Absolutely.

Should most people care about the difference between charging to whatever their manufacturer counts as 'daily' vs nerdy micro-managing of their battery condition?

Probably not.

If their manufacturer has done their homework, the two approaches will differ very little after ten or even fifteen years. If the manufacturer hasn't done their homework, following these recipes isn't going to fix things. | I mean this in the kindest way possible and I don't know your personal circumstances but on the surface this seems to be the kind of disposable / unsustainable mentality that is causing humanity to rush headlong into ecological disaster. You are absolutely right that looking at this in the narrowest purely economic terms, for many people (especially those who can afford a new EV), taking good care of your battery won't make much difference to the financial bottom line.

But at the same time, it doesn't require a lot of effort to be kinder to your battery.  Charging to 80% rather than 100% means that if you take a short notice road trip you might have to spend an extra 10 minutes fast charging somewhere along the way. Batteries are the dirtiest part of the car to manufacture and the most expensive thing to replace. Shortening their life span unnecessarily for the sake of a rather hypothetical minor convenience improvement doesn't make sense to me.

It's the [shopping cart theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_cart_theory) in another form.

I am sure there are edge cases (people with commutes that are approaching the limits of their car's range, etcâ€¦) where the convenience / global benefit equation changes, but since we're already talking about most people I think the point is still valid. | > If I hit the SoH until it was 50% it would STILL serve my uses.

That's the common misconception. Batteries die not at 0% SoH, but at 70%, more or less. At that SoH, the internal resistance is so high that it will produce too much heat to be safe. | ""90% of you aren't going to ...""

When every Joe in the country wants to be rich on EV-chargers instantly. I remember just over a year ago, here in Sweden, every Joe invested in a private Charging company. Every charger on every corner - had its own infrastructure.

1) You have the exotic miniature slow chargers on every corner, you see it, you have no clue how to use it because there's no sign with instructions and just a QR code that forces you to install ""Unknown-Joe-Company"" here, and...

2) Unknown Joe thinks he's brilliant and has his own Joe-App that after installation wants all your credit info. So after standing there for 30-40 minutes after finally getting approved to use the dinky Slow-charger miniature stick, wants you to ""bring-your-own-cable"" and...

3) Asks for you to have a subscription where you pay a Monthly fee, which makes it super expensive to use the dinky random Joe company charging stick, and ofc. there's only that location which you will use only 2 times a year.

4) Then there's the super-chargers. OFC. they are out of function, so the only working one has all of their slots filled up with Teslas, when there's a special Tesla charge park nearby, which require you to become a member of that too.

5) Then you have the chargers that have switched company agreements, so the one RFID tag  you had that claims they're in kahootz with all of the countrys chargers, doesn't work anymore - and you call customer service, which ofc. asks you via-robot-services to find and locate the charger station number, which is ofc. well hidden, and there's 100 different serial numbers.

6) Then you have the stations that needs a reset - you stand there for 30-60 minutes just to reach customer service, and you're now their on-site-remote-service-tech and are being told by a scripted external partner to do what you already did for 30 minutes so they can rule out those basic user-errors, and as a reward you'll be fined with the maximum charging price if they manage to reset the station, as a reward for being their on-site tech.

7) Then you have the vandalized stations no one uses or bothers to service, because let's face it, most people don't want to stand there in pouring rain for 60 minutes to fight charging customer services.

8) Then you have the company that finally accepts your RFID tag, but they charge more than gasoline for the power, and to top it of they decide to pull 50-100$ from your bank account in order to finally adjust the price.

9) Ofc. they don't talk to the other charging stations, so you get an additional fee of 50-100$ on the next station as well.

10) Yeah I'm gonna stop here, but there's 100's of examples.

But there's still a lot out there that don't, at least most of them seem to accept Electroverse RFID cards, which are free so fairly easy to get set up with - unless you're at a charger and haven't ordered it yet as happened to me!

Much of the issue with apps is you get to the charger and.. there's no signal!

For AC chargers then accepting RFID is probably good enough. | If they don't require their own app, how are they going to sell your data to make more money off of you? | [deleted] | It is something that needs to improve - agreed, but it's what happens when you have a bunch of people getting to market quickly, and lack significant incentive to do it differently.

While data collection may be one reason, a big reason is reducing cost.  If you charge a card each time you pay auth and other fees on top of the % that is paid to the card network and payment services provider.  Most of these apps use a sort of wallet model where they charge your card, say, $20, and if you use $10 you carry a balance.  This reduces the total number of charges, saving some money at scale.  It also allows for non-card payment methods (like PayPal), again, to reduce cost.

"Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losers","Recently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo

2: Chevrolet Blazer: 4/10

Buy an Equinox. Or buy a Lyriq if you have the cash. This car feels like a worse version of both at the same time, and I'm not sure why. Chevy for some reason seems to not quite have 1 pedal driving down as well as Cadillac does, and while I could forgive this for the Equinox to an extent, it somehow feels worse in the Blazer. Likewise, the interior is a major downgrade from the Lyriq but not *really* an upgrade over the Equinox. There's stiching on the doors, but it's all softish plastic, not even fake leather. Dash feels very similar, as do the buttons to the Equinox. I'd say it's like \~10% nicer, and you get a HUD and a slightly larger vehicle than the Equinox. But if you want that, stretch for the Lyriq or get a slightly used one for the same price.

My first thought given the RS badge was that this would be the ""sporty"" one, but no. Zero steering feel, poor pedal feel, numb acceleration. I could forgive it, but given there's better options that GM makes, I think they just messed this one up

Oh, and normal door handles. The Blazer has that while the Equinox and Lyriq have the the pop out door handles. I have no idea why. It feels like they had a bunch of ICE Blazer door handles and want to use them up

3: Ford F-150 Lightning: 8/10

Now, to start; I am not a Truck guy. I don't have any use for one. No one in my family owns one. So keep that in mind for this review

But I gotta say, I was really blown away by the F-150 Lightning. It's a huge truck, but it really doesn't FEEL that way. The steering is good, manuverability is great, far better than you'd think for such a beast. Honestly, other than the massive tires reminding me, it felt like I was driving a midsized SUV, not a full sized truck

If you don't tow far or often, and you want a full sized, Ford is offering a whole bunch of cash on the hood. And it feels like a normal Ford! Physical gear shifter, same sort of seating, same UI. A bit meh UI, but it's very user friendly. I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed it

It solves the two major issues imo of a full sized ICE truck; fuel economy and driving feel. If you can get a deal and want a truck; jump on it. Just be aware that this is very much a gen 1 product and won't hold value

4: Hyundai Ioniq 5: 8.5/10

You know that saying that a heretic is worse than a heathen? That's my experience with the Ioniq 5. It's *so close* to being a 10/10, but there's a few ergonomic issues that just really kill it

It has great one pedal driving, imo tied for 2nd with Tesla, slightly behind Volvo. Great charging speed, suprisingly fun handling given its an SUV. Read the reviews; it's great, everyone says it is, and I agree with them

*However*; 3 major issues that I found. First; the steering wheel obscures the gauge cluster unless you put it up unnaturally high. Second, the seat. I couldn't really find a comfy seating position; even with the seat all the way down, I felt like my head was almost touching the roof, and I'm not even that tall at \~6'1. Third, the bezels around the infotainment are absurdly large. It feels like an old timey TV with the massive box around them

Now, most of this is apparently fixed in the 2025 model year refresh. But it's just frustrating becasue even with the Ioniq 6 which I saw there, the bezel issue wasn't as bad. They know it's bad clearly! But it took awhile to fix. If you don't mind these things, then this is imo the best value. But I can't get over it

5: Tesla Model Y SR: 6/10

This is another similar casualty to the Blazer and the Ioniq 5. It's not AWFUL; although I find the interior to be pretty bad for the price. But the Model 3 highland fixes all the issues I have with the current Model Y, and it does it while being cheaper. I'd really, *strongly* recommend waiting until whatever the Model Y update

Drivetrain wise, pretty good! Tesla has good one pedal driving, like I said previously. It just falls apart with the interior quality. I found that the fake wood (or maybe real?) just felt really bad to the touch. I had a hard time adjusting the air vents in a pleasing way, which was annoying. The seats were just very uncomfortable, the merged headrest felt awful after awhile. Maybe if it was an economy car, whatever. But given the only configuration available for purchase new is the LR at \~$60,000 CAD, I expect better

Otherwise, I think it's... okay. For the price it was useable when the only competition it really has was the ID.4 and nearly impossible to get models like the Ioniq 5. But now supply has caught up, new models exist, and like I said; I *know* that Tesla can do better because they do! They have a great product in the form of the Model 3 Highland!

6: Chevrolet Equinox: 9/10

Chevy has a hit in the making if they can just market it well. This car will be my next vehicle.

Now that my cards are on the table, I will offer some criticism. The UI works fine, concerns there are overblown. But it's just a bit slow. Not the WORST (looking at you Volvo) by any means, but something that's disappointing. 1PD isn't super smooth, but it's less bad than the Blazer

Otherwise, I'll just say that this car provides value. Good range, okay charging speeds, but good enough. This is the car of close enough; everything except range isn't really class leading, but for the price and all together makes a great package

My biggest complaint? I'd like to denounce the Chevy exec who gave this thing 21 inch rims. It looks ridiculous, like a child wearing their father's shoes. But hey, maybe there were people who said ""yes, I'd love worse ride quality and worse fuel economy"". Maybe there are! If so, I'll apologize; you're a victim too

I honestly want to try and hypermile this. I genuinely think if I knocked this thing down to 19 or 18', I could hit the high 550s

7: Tesla Model 3 SR (Highland): 9/10

Tesla is the Apple of cars; you love it or you don't, but you have some sort of feeling about it one way or another. But if you're a spiritual Android user, if you can swallow your dislike, there's a LOT to like here

Every material issue I have with the model Y is basically solved. Better materials, better comfort, it feels quieter. Already very great UI is somehow even faster and better. For under $50k CAD, the RWD Standard range provides a whole bunch of value. \~440 km of range, good charging, access to the Tesla network (obviously), ventilated seats... again, 90% of my issue with it comes down to the monoscreen. I Just Don't Like It. It's not an issue for driving, but I don't find it aesthetically pleasing

But like I said; tonnes of value here if you like it or don't care about the layout.

8: BMW i4 M50: 10/10

You ever hear the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none. But better the Jack, than a master of one""? That is the BMW i4 to a tee. Nothing really crazy; even in terms of HP, there's faster cars out there. But my god does it come together in a fundamentally great package. The owner of this car was an enthusiasts, so he encouraged me to really give this the gas (or whatever) and it was great. He took over for awhile and REALLY gave it, and imo you could feel the weight around 9/10ths - but frankly, I don't think I'd ever get it there with any regularity, so the remaining 8/10ths are great

The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that it's pricey. My man had literally every possible option, down to the full leather seats, and the special paint. He said it was near 100k all in all. Now he also mentioned offhandedly that his wife sat in and loved the new iX and so they bought it when he went to pick his new i4 up a few years back, so I assume he's good for money, but still. Damn pricey

After a few years of BMW depreciation though? Madon, fantastic used vehicle

9: Nissan Ariya: 6/10

Who is this for?

In theory, the Ariya isn't a bad vehicle. It's rather nice actually; comfortable interior, very smooth powertrain, nice touchpoints. Very roomy! It feels like a much larger vehicle than it is

My issue with it was that its top trim is nearly $*65,000 CAD*. And it used to be more! They simplified the 25 trim differences, and that used to hit the 70s! The small battery option is in the mid 50s, and then it gets progressively more expensive. What justifies that? No super fast charging like the Ioniq 5, no major range, not really any brand appeal. Nissan seemed to make a Murano equivalent, but I never see Muranos! I see Rogues! They needed a Leaf varient with Rogue styling, and didn't deliver. I saw one for sale today with an advertised $10,000 cash on the hood. That says everything, imo

If it topped out at, say, 60, then I think that'd be fair enough. But even then, I find the local Nissan dealership awful to talk with based on my sister's experience with them, but that's not necessarily Nissan's fault

11: Volvo EX40: 7.5/10

You know the gene some people have that makes Cilantro taste like soap? That's Volvo. You either have the gene that makes you love Volvo, or you don't. I happen to have it, but I'll try and be objective

The powertrain; fantastic. It's smooth, but not in the same way as Hyundai or Tesla with their 1 pedal driving. You feel everything, but it feels fantastic. Steering is tight while driving fast, while instantly becoming very light and manuverable at low speeds. Great sound system even in the ""cheap"" harmen kardon option versus the B&O, and incredibly comfortable seats, as Volvo often does well

The downside is that this is a 40 series, not a 60 series, and it feels like it. Not super plush in terms of touchpoints, the seats are a textile blend. But it still feels nice enough. It's also very clearly a first gen product; it's just an electric XC40. Infotainment system also needs some work; it's slow, menu hell, and just generally a pain

But like I said; it's just so *nice* that I can ignore any flaws. Buy it used or lease it, and wait for the new EX60 to come out",1236,517,1728330345,"Like the reviews. Well done.

The i4 with the upgrade Harmon system is an incredible system and completely different from the other hk systems in other ICE bmws.  So if you care about stereos, that's a massive win.

The newer Volvos got an updated SOC and some massive software updates over the last few months.  My 24 went from buggy and slow to pretty quick and most stable.  It's quick good now.  On top of that, next year they get updated to Volvos next gen systems for free. | I leased the i4 xDrive40 a few weeks ago - more range than the M50 and still amazingly quick and handles great with the M Sport Package. Lease deal was pretty incredible on it and about the same price as many of the non luxury EVs. Cheaper than the Mach E and the Lightning by a lot, and it wasn't too far off the Hyundai stuff but drives so much better. Honestly so far I can't say enough nice things about how much I enjoy driving it. Better performance in acceleration, braking, lateral grip and cornering than the 2001 M3 that I've lusted after since they debuted.  It drives small and fun but comfortable, and my wife and kids fit. Throw it in eco mode and it's smooth like a Lexus. Super configurable as well in software to program the adaptive suspension and acceleration and handling. I'm spoiled now after a few weeks and don't like driving anything else. I went with the xDrive40 over the M50 after driving both.  It's the perfect blend for me, and has a bit more range. I'm also in a cold climate so will mostly run good all seasons to handle the occasional snow drive, not performance summer tires.  Honestly it floored me as a vehicle and made me love sport sedans again. | Y'know what I like about the Equinox over most other options? Colours. For fuck sakes Hyundai, offer the Ioniq range with some damn character. | Not surprised about the BMW EVs.  Every review has ranked it as a great car.

"Tesla owner who's driven 144,000 miles over six years reveals the staggering amount he's saved on gas",,1226,658,1727301722,"He saved $20k.  You're welcome.  Bebebebop | I've been averaging $200 a month in savings vs my gas car even with switching jobs and getting a shorter commute | I just did the math having two EVs in our family for a year replacing two ICE vehicles.  From June 2022-July 2023 we spent $3769.50 on gas for around 21,000 miles driven between two cars.  

From July 2023-August 2024 we spent a total of $796.87. This includes road trip charging at electrify America.

We also put in solar in January this year estimating a 10 year payback.  If we combine the savings of the EVs and electricity we are saving $7657.16 per year.  So the payback is closer to 6 years before taking into account the tax credit. | Waiting for someone to comment

>but the $12k in battery replacement will instantly negate the gas savings. | Finally a link on here not from petroleum propaganda industry | I initially calculated that switching to my Model 3 for my previous car, a Honda Civic, would save me about $15,000 in fuel cost over 10 years. 

My work installed free chargers, so that's going way up now. | So nobody cares about the extra $27,000 the car costs? | This only works if electricity is cheaper than gas. In Massachusetts, electricity currently costs $0.35/kWh (combined supply/delivery) and gas is around $2.80/gallon.  Electricity is significantly more expensive than gas. | 144,000 miles at 30 miles per gallon is 4800 gallons.  At $3 per gallon that's $14,400.  While that's a significant amount,  you still need to account for money spent on electricity for the Tesla (he claims he spent $4,255).

So $20,000 saved is cherry picking it quite a bit. Or he's just making up a number.

If I went from driving a 7 mpg medium duty truck to an electric car, for 144,000 miles, and got free electricity, and gas was $4 per gallon I'd save $82,275 in gas.

In reality, I went from a 37mpg car to an electric car, and gas is $3 per gallon.  Over 144,000 miles that's $11,675.  Electric car get 4 miles per kW. It costs me $0.09 per kW.  So that's $3,240.

I found most reviews were *extremely* positive regarding the car but I wanted to wait until they ironed out the major ""glitches"" before taking the plunge.

My Model 3, frankly, was a revelation.  I've ""only"" been driving since 1981 or thereabouts and in the years since have experienced a whole host of cars, good, bad, mediocre, and *terrible*.  The Model 3, to my mind, was like moving from a flip phone to an iPhone.

In time the Model Y came out and, again, I waited a year or so to get it... for my wife.  She was extremely skeptical and insisted her Toyota Highlander was just fine.  It didn't take very long before she admitted to me the MY was also leagues ahead of what she was used to.

So this past weekend, and with the overstock in Tesla vehicles, I noticed there were plenty of sales.  I decided to give it a look see and was especially interested in whether I could transfer my FSD to any new vehicle I should buy.

...welp...

That last bit is painfully important because I recently got my car back from an out of state collision center. It took 5 months to get all the parts needed for the full repairs and the total wasn't fully covered by the at-fault driver's insurance (fuck State Farm).

Study: Electric car batteries last much longer than expected,,1159,256,1732198290,"Full translation, I have highlighted the gist of the article:

The management consultancy P3 has analysed data from more than 7,000 electric cars and published findings on real-life battery ageing. Batteries lose performance over time, resulting in less range and, in the long term, energy storage that can no longer be used in practice. However, the mass failure of electric car batteries after just a few years predicted by some has not materialised.

The battery is the most expensive component in an electric car, which justifies concerns about its long-term durability. After all, a defect or severely reduced performance can result in high costs for owners - either through repairs, replacement of the battery or in the form of a reduced residual value of the vehicle. To find out the actual risks, the e-mobility specialists at P3 conducted a study.

Misinformation can have a negative impact on the transition to electromobility by increasing unfounded fears and thus reducing the social acceptance and market penetration of electric vehicles. Therefore, the provision of reliable and transparent data is crucial in order to convey a realistic picture of the actual battery life and thus strengthen confidence in electric vehicles,' say the consultants. In the first step, they analysed 50 electric cars from P3's own fleet, followed by real measurement data from 7,000 electric cars. They were supported by the battery diagnostics start-up Aviloo.

**The key results: In the first 30,000 kilometres or so, capacity loss is accelerated and the so-called State of Health (SoH) drops relatively quickly from 100 to around 95 percent. The real degradation decreases with increasing kilometre mileage. According to the Electrive portal, the Aviloo data from the 7,000 vehicles showed an (average) SoH of around 90 per cent at 100,000 kilometres. After that, the trend line is almost horizontal, between 200,000 and 300,000 kilometres it is almost stable - and is well above the 70 to 80 percent from the battery warranty. In fact, it is closer to 87 per cent.**

The data from the 50 P3 vehicles matches the results from the Aviloo analysis. Almost all of the P3 vehicles tested have an SoH of over 90 per cent. This indicates that the batteries in the P3 fleet continue to maintain very good performance despite different manufacturers, different usage profiles and intensive use,' it says.

P3 points out that the data available for vehicles with a mileage of over 200,000 kilometres is significantly smaller than for vehicles with a lower mileage. The reason is that there are only a few vehicles with such a long range. This limits the significance of high mileages somewhat and also leads to a greater scattering of data,' says the study.

To allay customers' concerns about electric cars, manufacturers offer extensive warranties on traction batteries. Up to eight years or 160,000 kilometres are common, usually with a guarantee of over 70 to 80 percent remaining storage capacity. The influence of the battery condition on the residual value of a car when it is sold is particularly important for owners. Within the warranty period, the loss in value is heavily dependent on ageing and the remaining capacity,' explains P3. After the warranty expires, a greater loss in value is to be expected.' | In my car (2021 Mach E AWD with standard battery), the battery state of health the first time I checked it was around 94% at around 48,000 kilometers.  I'm not sure how accurate the car's data is because it seemed to drop a percentage or so immediately after a couple of OTA updates.

It sat at around 92% until between 80,000 km and 113,000 km, but now it's says 92.5% at 120,000 km.

Again, I'm not entirely confident at how accurate the car's information is, but my range is still about the same as when it was brand new.  I think I'm past any danger of manufacturing defects, so I don't have any reason to suspect that the battery won't easily last a couple hundred of thousand kilometers more. | Once again not considering calendar aging and time since formation as the main parameter, not use.

Calendar aging scales as approximately sqrt(time).  All is as expected by science, in fact.

Add a linear degradation from use which is fairly small for a big battery car, (fewer cycles) on top of a sqrt calendar aging. | Longer than *who* expected? | Hopefully manufacturers wisen up and sell extended warranties going to 16 years.

That will add to revenues and to the bottom line and if batteries really last for a very long time, the joke is on people like me who want the longest battery warranty, owing to the understanding that 1) calendar aging happens even if the battery remains unused at a low SoC state and that 2) not all pack failures are a result of degradation so I'd rather have a warranty on the battery pack (not failing) rather than on just degradation. 70% capacity within eight years is a very low bar. | They naysayers won't believe this. Even if it was proven 20 times. They know how long their smartphone battery lasts and that's enough for them. | Moral of the story, buy 30% more range than you actually need and you have a car that will last you a lifetime. | [deleted] | Mine died at about 44k. Good news is Kia is fully covering the replacement and the mileage warranty restarts with the new battery | The EV batteries that I think got the longest usable life out of them was the ones in the original Tesla Roadster.

Maybe, but they'll need more than that for stock price to stay at Silicon Valley startup levels rather than regular car company levels.  A lot is riding on nebulous future development like AI, robotaxi, level 5 self driving, etc.  But honestly, cuts like this only reinforce the impression that Tesla is just another car company.

EDIT: okay, Musk said recently he expected the 10% layoffs to save the company about $1B annually.  Some quick back-of-napkin calculations suggest that would only raise profit margins to about 6.5%.  A 20% cut would theoretically get them to a 7.7% profit. | Who would have guessed Tesla would go down so fast while Hyundai/Kia seems to set new EV sales records every month and are ahead of schedule on the new US factory.

"A universal Plug and Charge' protocol for EV charging is coming in 2025 | No more fobs, no more app signups. Just plug in and start charging.",,1112,219,1733324140,"ok, so this is just the current Plug and Charge ISO standard and implementation with a framework for getting your certificates included by default in the trust list.

The current standard requires each auto maker to individually add the charger vendor's secure certificates to their software.  Since credit card and other data is passing over it, you want to ensure that the vendor is reputable, has proper cybersecurity protocols, you have a process to revoke their certificates if they end up exploited, etc.  

In short, it's a bit of a pain point where each EV vendor needs to talk to each charger company to get Plug and Charge implemented, which is just a lot of duplicative work for everyone, and each EV manufacturer will have a different process for approving vendors.

This standardizes the process, and puts a universal trust list in place that all EV makers and charger network groups can use.  Each vendor contributes some money to the group so that they can keep the list up to date, revoke old certificates, etc.

Seems like an industry that's maturing. | **Let this be true**. Let this be true. **Let this be true**. Let this be true. **Let this be true**, etc.... | Useless if the rate ($ per kWh) isn't shown prominently on the charger at the time of plugging in. Gotta be like gasoline pumps with the rate displayed without having to press a button on the unit, if a display even exists.

If it requires an app to show the rate, for example, most Tesla Superchargers in the US, that's not much better than having to use the app to start.

We'll probably get a whole lot of surprises when unscrupulous charge sites prey on unknowing consumers and they get charged some huge sum. | My personal favorite is the chargers that make you download an app for a free charger. | Just put credit card readers on the chargers.

Electric Cars Are Suddenly Becoming Affordable,,1103,458,1717438858,"Market correction. All the gloom and doom reporting is pushing prices down and making EVs even more enticing. | They suddenly seem affordable because - SURPRISE! - there's a used car supply.  New cars are always expensive, so people shop the used market.  But until recently the choices for a used EV have been terrible.  Who wants a Leaf that gets 100 miles on a charge?  But now you can pick up a few year old Bolt for a song, can buy a used luxury EV for the price of a new Corolla, and woohoo!  Choices! 

It will only get better.  Looking forward to a three-year-old Equinox, if not a four-year-old Blazer. | About to pull the trigger on a 2021 Bolt with like 20k miles, which all told after taxes and fees and tax rebates should be like $13-$14k. Not too shabby at all. | It's amazing how good and cheap electric cars have become recently. We jumped on a Leaf plus in 2019 and upgraded to a EUV in 2022 because the trade value was bonkers. 

Seeing new EVs come out with more space, range, and better charging than our Bolt for a similar price is good news for everyone. I'm kind of jealous and I'm excited for when we get to replace it. It's looking like we might see solid state batteries in the near future.

I hope that the infrastructure can keep pace. Right now between me and my parents is about 200 miles. There are only a couple of stops that make sense for us to charge at and in the cold, we need them. If one of them is down, it's very stressful. The Tesla network helps this a lot, but I'd love to see the infrastructure pumped at the same time! | Paid $49k for a lightning.  MSRP was $74k.  Love this thing! | I believe a big driver for affordability going forward will be the localization of production and cheaper chemistries coming on the market. Hyundai and Kia have been making major strives in bringing down cost, so I have high hopes for them. | It'll be interesting to see what happens once ICE vehicle becomes more expensive than a comparable EV.

I think for a lot of people, that's the automatic decider for them. Most people aren't going to sit down and number crunch to figure out the full cost of ownership over a long term. They're looking at purchase price at best, or monthly payments. And any up front premium is just unappealing.

At the speed things are changing, I'm hoping we're at that turnover point by the end of the decade. There's a lot of people throwing in their economic analysis of the situation, with lots of great points raised, but it feels like it's an almost impossible task to predict with precision. But the direction is clear.

When we do hit that stage, it's going to make the anti EV people even funnier.

"EV sales have not fallen, cooled, slowed or slumped.",,1098,222,1725974904,"It is very hard to understand what is really going on. All sides add their own spin, even manipulating data and graphs to make their side seem to be winning.

I don't know why there has to be sides though. It is a completely ridiculous situation. | The Electrek author is cherry-picking the Cox Q1 2024 report. When you look at things over the course of an entire year in the United States:

* Q2 2023 showed a 49.8% increase in sales compared to Q2 2022
* Q3 2023 showed a 48.4% increase compared to Q3 2022
* Q4 2023 showed a 40.4% increase compared to Q4 2022
* Q1 2024 showed an 2.6% increase compared to Q1 2023
* Q2 2024 showed a 2.9% increase compared Q2 2023

So while EV sales have not ""fallen"", they **are** essentially plateauing, in terms of absolute sales numbers, in our particular market.

And the reporting has not been that EVs are falling, cooling, slowing, or slumping when compared to gas / petrol cars. Media outlets have reported, correctly, that in **certain** markets, like the USA, hybrids and PHEVs are growing at a faster rate than EVs. And that's really just down to more hybrid and PHEV models becoming available in those markets.

Both ""EV sales are breaking EV sales records"" and ""Other segments are growing faster than EVs"" can be true. | It is correct to say that EV sales continue to grow globally, but it is also true that in some places EVs are seeing little to no growth (UK), and some BEV markets are also contracting (Germany).  It doesn't all have to be black and white. | The oil and gas companies have led a very successful misinformation campaign spooking would be buyers. | According to Argonne National Laboratory EV sales have been down YOY in both June and July of this year. This link takes you to July which shows EV sales down 1.2% from 2023. So to me that's quite literally down. Another reputable source is Atlas Public Policy but we will see once they release their numbers. I agree with the article however that there are many reasons why this slow is occurring regardless of the early adopter phase closing. https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates | There will be regional variations in sales for various reasons including changes in policies, but globally, sales of EVs have generally continued to go up with pretty minor and short-lived blip save for a major blip that affected vehicle production and sales in general and not just EVs.

Electrek is a US-based site, and there are factors that are for the recent past and short term future going to be pretty difficult. It's not that other countries don't have their own different factors or don't share any of these factors, which should go without saying, but the combination of all these factors are pretty reasonable explanations for recent slowdowns for EV sales in the US. 

The US EV market is uniquely dominated by a single automaker, Tesla, and that automaker has a limited lineup that has been pretty slow in introducing significant refreshes and new vehicle models as well as leadership that is closely identified with the brand and is very polarizing including to what would perhaps be a rather broad swathe of the target demographic of premium segment EVs in the US.

EVs are part of a larger political battle that's pretty ugly and the US is in the midst of a major election the outcome of which would have far-ranging ramifications on the industry and market within the US and the disinformation and uncertainty that has been ramping pretty heavily likely plays a factor in curtailing interest in purchasing EVs for a large segment of the population and even makes some people very openly antagonistic towards EVs.

Among those who are interested in purchasing an EV and are doing their research, there's probably a bit of holding back on purchases because the North America charging landscape is split into three different kinds of chargers and with two of them still being very common and being built out to this day. There is supposedly a move towards a single standard, NACS, but there still is yet to be a single non-Tesla vehicle shipped with a compatible port. There seems to be a high likelihood we'll see such within a year or two, but knowing that can potentially cause prospective, informed buyers to wait until that does happen.

The US and China are engaging in a trade war of sorts and so the largest producer and arguably innovator of EVs, China, has not been able to reasonably sell their products within the US including to some degree EV components. | I like but then I've been making similar arguments for years.

It has been obvious for years that China intends to be a major player in most technologies that will be dominant in the near and medium term future. We just need to look at its past few 5 year plans and ""follow the money"" i.e. subsidies, tax breaks, loan support etc., and keep in mind that China joined the World TRADE Organization signaling its intentions quite clearly.

Instead of recognizing this reality and upping their games the US and EU went all in on BS. For years I've heard policy makers making extremely stupid comments about 'containing' China. Since that containment failed they switched to high tariffs to keep China out of their economies.  That this is just as stupid a policy as containment is easy enough to see, just skim some academic studies on the Great Depression.

Take a good look at that chart labelled The World Hit 'Peak"" Gas Powered Vehicle Sales In 2017. It should be pointed out that the 2017 peak is also the peak of global light vehicle sales for all vehicles regardless of fuel type. 

Last year some 13.7 million plugin vehicles were sold.  This year China alone will sell more plugins than that and the total global sales should be around 24 million units. Those extra 10 million units will come straight from ICE and mild hybrids whose sales will fall by some 20% to 40 million units. In 2026 China plugin sales will be 30 million units, i.e. 100% market share with plugin exports the rest of the world selling an addition 20 million units. That's a 60% hit to ICE and mild hybrids. Legacy car makers should be going bankrupt like lemmings over the proverbial cliff. This also explains why VW execs say they have 2 years to turn it around.

What the author of the article, Jameson Dow, misses is that China's EV makers are selling EVs for cheaper than what used 1st world ICE vehicles sell for in the 3rd/developing world.  The used vehicle market is some 3 times larger than the new car market and China's EV makers intend to displace a big chunk of those 'used' sales with inexpensive and superior new EVs.

It comes as no surprise to me that oil prices are crashing with WTI trading at $66.28 today.

Very interesting times indeed! | It kind of like this.  You go from 0-40 in 4 seconds.  Then you go from 40-80 in 6 seconds.   The people who write articles about EVs call that ""slowing down"".

Exclusive: Trumps transition team aims to kill Biden EV tax credit,,1081,582,1731614344,"The residual affect the last time we sunsetted the EV credit was that Tesla dropped their prices. Today there is more competition domestically and global market pressures. 

It's worth being concerned about but Texas has the largest wind turbine installation in the US with a state government openly hostile to the technology. 

The horse has left the barn folks. EVs are the future. | Read: ""How to ensure China eats your lunch worldwide"". 

Tough on trade, weak on sense, this bunch. | Harms an already lagging American EV industry both domestically and overseas. Just so stupid. | Can we do gas subsidies too or will Trump's gas n oil buddies be angry about that? | The headline should read trumps buddy Elon wants to kill EV subsidies because his competitors are catching his ass in sales and he knows it. | The oil industry needs oil prices to go up to be profitable. They want to raise domestic oil demand as much as possible. So get ready for more inflation.

Tesla isn't the only car maker that would benefit - this is a huge gift to Toyota. Toyota is the most climate-hostile car company. [https://www.citizen.org/news/toyota-misleads-in-climate-policy-report/](https://www.citizen.org/news/toyota-misleads-in-climate-policy-report/) | Alternative title: ""CEO of the company who benefited the most from the EV tax credits stands to benefit the most  from having the standing to directly advise the President of the United States to discontinue them"" | The EV tax credit relies on sourcing battery critical materials domestically. The legacy OEMs have put a lot of funding into these efforts to build up US critical material supply chain. Just here in Nevada we have GM dumping huge money into Thacker pass and Ford going after Rhoyolte ridge. Tesla has put efforts into building up a Chinese supply chain. This will hurt Tesla's competition, hurt the US, and help China. | It's actually hilarious how the folks that voted him in are going to get fucked, next is the renewable energy market that gets destroyed. | They'll keep the oil subsidies, though.",electricvehicles,,Tesla,Reddit
"Mercedes Reinvents Brakes For EVs, Puts Them Inside The Drive Unit",,1078,357,1732373223,"People are going to hate on this because of serviceability, but EVs have already shown brakes can last well over 100k miles. This system Mercedes has shown appears to use significantly more pad material which should last even longer, so their claims of ""lifetime"" seem reasonable. These really have a lot of benefits:

* Brakes aren't exposed to the elements increasing life
* Rotors don't spin, the pads do, so less ~~unsprung weight~~ spinning mass, which is good for efficiency
* Moving brake parts inboard reduces unsprung weight which is good for handling
* Rotors are water cooled (would be neat if they could scavenge heat)
* Brake dust is captured (less pollution)
* Wheel designs don't need to worry about brake cooling
* Less or no braking noises | EURO7 will regulate emissions from brake dust so it's likely this system will become a standard at least on the rear drive unit. | I like it.  As someone that lives in winter/salted roads climate. Half my Rotor Replacements are from corrosion, not wear already.

Especially for a rear drive unit, where they deal with much less brake force to start with.

Regen + Rear means it should be quite easy to have a lifetime sealed brakes.

I'd probably want traditional brakes on the front, sealed on the rear. | This would head off what I feel is a big unintended consequences of regenerative braking, hose and seal failure. Even in wheel mounted brakes EV pads will last close to the life of the car, the rubber hose and piston seals won't. EVs don't go in for regular maintenance so the aging rubber won't be caught until it's fairly advanced. This invention removes the rubber degradation issue. | On first glance this seem like a terrible idea, but if you give it more thought it might actually make sense, my model 3 performance has 100k KMs on it and the original brake pad and rotor are basically new, at least 90% life left... Regen braking really saves friction brakes I almost never use the friction brakes


The only downside I can think of is if you track your car this isn't going to work | I like this, the best part is the aero win by closing the wheel. Unsprung and rotating mass reduction also helps. |  They will make sure to use a design/materials to last one day past warranty period and no more. Called German Minimal viable design. Just enough and one one more penny.

I predict it will require special tools etc and a brake change will cost 10K. | So they are implying they will be making quad motor EVs in the future because each wheel requires its own brake for ABS to work well. | Sounds cool until you gotta pay for the maintenance out of warranty ðŸ˜˜ | I like this for the brake dust capture and the ability to have fully covered wheels for aerodynamics.

I'm not keen on the eventual service costs to crack one of these units open for the third or fourth owner... ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",electricvehicles,,Tesla,Reddit
Tesla needs to come clean about HW3 before the word 'fraud' comes out,,1068,475,1729007666,"The moment Musk says ""no true autonomy for HW3"" there is going to be a class-action lawsuit and he knows it. | As a hw3 owner I've been saying this for years. Admit it and offer FSD transfer for life for those customers. | Full Self Driving has been promised since the Model S AP2 days.  Yeah it's fraud.  Especially when you consider many paid north of $10,000 for the option.  The Model 3 was supposed to be THE RoboTaxi that you could shop out.  Making money driving around town while you sleep or work. I sense a class action lawsuit coming.  (Not being political). I believe Musk getting close to Trump is basically for air cover in case he gets sued and needs a pardon.  Yeah I think it could get that bad.   Introducing the RoboTaxi is basically an admission that every version of the car prior to this car will never be true Full Self Driving. | Sucks for those who bought that early thinking they'd truly get autonomous driving.

Never in a million years did i think our 2021 would get it and knew going in. 

My guess is HW4 won't get it either. 

Buy a car for what it is then, not what it could be in the future. | > Making a mistake is not a fraud. If Tesla really thought that it could deliver unsupervised self-driving to vehicles equipped with HW3 and, at one point, it figured out that it couldn't, it's not fraud even though it used that as a selling point for millions of vehicles for years.

Hard disagree on this. This is mis-advertising at best or just fraud depending on how much they knew. You don't make such a sale promise without knowing it can be done in the consumer space. | Tells us again that you never should buy something on the promise of future features. They may never come. Judge what you get for your money now and decide according to that. | Bit late for that.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

... | They STILL don't know what they'll need to actually have true, unsupervised, FSD. So nothing so far will suffice, very likely. Sensors & cameras (as well as their placements), chips, etc. Are. Not. Final. 

Don't buy assuming otherwise, but also - yes, they did promise it with pretty much every generation of vehicle they sold, and they'll continue to make grand claims that once they solve autonomy, they'lll begin work to bring it to other vehicles...but if you've been paying attention, you should know by now that it's just not going to be feasible for all or most current and past generations cars. | If early adopters (now HW3 and prior) don't receive some sort of compensation I see a massive lawsuit coming. Like record massive. 

Tesla should make FSD free for personal use to all early adopters. They literally paid for the development and got screwed the whole way. A few thousand people getting the hypothetically finished software in this scenario for free would do nothing to their hypothetical margins. | HW4 probably won't get it either, if it makes anyone feel better.",electricvehicles,,Tesla,Reddit
BMW overtakes Tesla in European electric car market ,,1068,348,1724321063,"2024 YTD BEV market share in UK:

1. VW Group: 16.5%

2. Tesla: 13.2%

3. BMW: 11.7%

4. Stellantis: 11.7%

5. Hyundai/Kia: 9.8%.

It's a pretty healthy market in terms of competition. | I think BMW's strategy is interesting among the German automakers in that they're using essentially the same nomenclature system and the same look with their ICE vehicles that their core audience is familiar with. I understand that part of it was a sort of cost-savings measure in order to use more of the same platform, but I really think it's really having it look virtually identical to its ICE vehicles that's making it work for them. I think if Mercedes had, still with its dedicated EV platforms, simply made their EVs look almost identical to their ICE vehicles, then that would have paid off fairly well for them and perhaps even better than the shared platform the BMW EVs have. | Just a single month. Should be more concise with the title. | 1 month is too short.  The previous month Tesla outsold BMW in Europe 3:1. | For July, the first month of the quarter. 

Tesla is trying to unwind the quarterly wave, but it apparently still has a ways to go. | >euro brand makes euro wagon EV

Yeah no one is surprised they're selling | I'm not wild about BMW overall, but their electric vehicles that I've had experience with are *nice*. | I'm just, oh wow that's a gorgeous wagon, where is it, I need it.

Over 40% Of Tesla's Profit Comes From Selling Regulatory Credits,,1069,279,1732394407,"The old CAFE MPGe formula for EVs was pretty wild.  A gallon of gasoline releases 36 kwh of energy when you burn it with oxygen, but the old formula set 82 kwh as equivalent to a gallon.

I don't fully agree with the new formula either because it takes into account losses from distribution and production, where ICE cars don't have to worry about the energy cost of refining and distributing fuel.

Don't ask me about the footprint rule or light trucks. | The weirdest thing about these ""gotchas"" is that most folks here seemingly support a carbon tax. | Dividing revenue of one thing by total profit produces lots of silly stats.

Nice job | Ok... But what percentage of revenue? Wouldn't that be the more meaningful statistic ðŸ¤” | 60% comes from selling cars I think they will be better than okay. | You mean the same regulatory credit that's available to EVERY SINGLE AUTOMAKERS but they can only get paid they make enough EV.

93.7% of EV owners would NOT switch back to ICE [survey by Fully Charged SHOW],,1052,406,1720012763,"I hate to be the wet blanket, but is it possible there's some selection bias at work here?  From what I can tell, respondents were found via the Fully Charged youtube channel, which strikes me as probably a much more enthusiastic subset of people compared to EV owners at large. | After a year of EV ownership, I will absolutely never go back to an ICE. | My uncle is old school and doesn't really adopts new technology quickly but he really like the Tesla S. I do think americans would buy a EV if it was more affordable and more ways to charge. The propaganda from fossil fuel companies saying people don't want EV is all lies. We just need more competition in the USA for EV. | After a month of enjoying my MachE, I told my wife that if I totaled it today I would start shopping for a new one tomorrow. Still true. | I'm on my third EV and never looking back. My child is fully on board with never owning an ICE car. They drove one at the driving school and hated it. | Had an EV for 18 months before pulling the trigger and replacing our remaining gas burner with another EV. | I've never met an EV owner that wanted to switch to back ICE.  Do they exist?  Sure.  But I pretty much only interact with big city suburbanites, and for this demographic EV's give sliced bread a run for its money.  Charging is a piece of cake at home and it eliminates the big money commuting gas bill, and the drive is so much better in every way. | I'm getting really tired of these surveys. Mainly because every single day survey results are posted, the results are wildly different. | I've been an ev driver for just over a year and I can't imagine buying an ice car again. | Going back to ICE would be like going back to mechanical hard drives from an SSD.

PSA: Avoid the Chevrolet Blazer EV,"**I'm writing this after getting stranded in my 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV for the third time in less than three months.** For context, I bought the Blazer EV on May 11, 2024. The software is fully updated. It has now had a high voltage system failure three separate times. My dealer told me that I'm not the first customer of theirs that this has happened to.

My Blazer EV was in service for 29 out of my first 45 days of ownership, and will now be back in service again for the same issue.

https://imgur.com/a/JQR7j9D

Notice the difference in mileage between all of these pictures. I took each of these pictures immediately after the error codes popped up.

To make matters worse, I was on a 300 mile road trip for work when the error code popped up yesterday. I was charging at a fast charger and the charging stopped. I luckily had enough charge to make it home at 2% battery. I had to drive home in 100Â° heat for an hour and a half with no AC to conserve range because the Blazer EV quit charging unexpectedly.

My Blazer EV is sitting in my garage unable to charge, stuck at 2%. The dealership is getting it towed to them Monday morning and bringing me a loaner.

I asked GM to buy back the car after the second high voltage system issue. I said it was not reliable or safe. GM refused my buy back request before because the car was fixed.

Less than a month later I was over 100 miles from home, charging quit unexpectedly, in 100Â° heat, and worried if I'd make it home safely.

All because of the Chevrolet Blazer EV.

**The Chevrolet Blazer EV is a safety hazard.** Avoid the Blazer EV at all costs. GM is a nightmare. They don't stand behind their products because their products are terrible.

After this laughably awful experience, I will never buy a GM product again.",1047,433,1722849294,"29 days in the shop should qualify you for lemon law in most states.

If I turn the AC on in the truck I cannot get over 50KW.

You can even show it on demand. It will be charging at 150+kw flip the AC to max and it drops down to 38. Turn the AC off and it instantly climbs back to 150... Not sure if the cabin and the battery share a loop for the AC but when it's 95+Â° outside no AC while charging is painful....

So far I'm not impressed. I have it as a rental so I'm not permanently glued to it luckily. | PSA to mention that the Honda Prologue is literally just a blazer with Honda badging. Will be interesting to see if they suffer the same issues. | My wife's lyriq is currently getting its battery replaced.   Doesn't appear the ultium platform is ready for full time yet.

We are at like 15 days and waiting for the battery parts. | You could always plug your VIN into the NHTSA recall site to see if anything comes up but a generic search against the 24 Blazer EV only shows five complaints and three recalls none of which line up with your concern.

China becomes the world's first nation to sell over a million EVs in a month,,1038,230,1726169758,"For reference 15.5M vehicles were sold in the US in 2023 so we would need EVs to be at least 78% of new sales in order to see 1M sold per month. | **PHEVs are included which have a share of close to 50%..** | Ok now let them be imported Duty free so they can be purchased for 1/2 the cost. When our entire fucking planet depends on it, I think that outweighs saying good bye to 1-2% of the GDP. Seriously it's worth not having to choke on forest fire smoke for 2 months of the year, atrocious heat waves and whatever hell the next suprise is. | Western car makers are so f$%ed.  They had a decades long head start and they still managed to blow it. | Wouldn't it be ironic if it ends up being fuckin' China that does most of the work delivering climate change solutions.  
  
Not that half the US would care anyway. | China definitely is leading in the EV segment.   Unfortunately in the US we will have a 100% duty on top of the cars price to buy one.   But artificially supporting our huge legacy auto manufacturing industry even though it is inefficient is important enough to justify that tariff/tax. | These conversations are always the same: China is killing it on the EV front, US redditors cry that something ""isnt' fair"", and blame China. Or Telsa. Or whoever's in the WH.

We are watching the downfall of the ICE auto industry world-wide. We are in the beginning of the adoption curve for EVs and this entails the destruction of existing manufacturing, including the once-mighty US auto industry.

As per American tradition, the line workers and everyone except the execs, will simply be out of a job.  Meanwhile, these execs will ride away into the sunset with platinum parachutes funded on the backs of these workers. 

All the while, US observers will say ""China did it! The President did it! The unions did it! Etc....""  Don't fall for it. It's petroleum and auto forcing these manufacturers into the ground and walking away with millions.

DON'T BE FOOLED. Again. | In China you can buy a good quality EV for only 14K Canadian dollars, so the Canadian government charges 100% tariffs. | They're also charging like $12,000 to get a license plate for a gas car and throttling their usage by fining buyers for using their gas cars on busy days. 

So, they're pretty much forcing their population to use EVs by taxing gas car users. 

One upside in the Chinese market is that they have supercharging and ultra fast charging for relatively cheap fees, way cheaper than in the USA using Tesla's infrastructure. 

Like, if you bought an EV in the USA and could only charge with a supercharger and not at your house/apartment, you'd actually get more mileage and cheaper ""fuel"" with a hybrid vehicle. 

In China. supercharging is cheaper than the above scenario. 

I've never been to China. And i don't own an EV, but i have been watching videos about them for a few days now.

Trump is probably going to kill the crash reporting rule that made Tesla look bad,,1032,227,1734124463,"Wait. The president who had a campaign run that was funded by a CEO is going to reduce corporate accountability for the company that CEO runs?

I'm shocked. Absolutely shocked. | it only made tesla look bad because tesla pushed the broadest product out earliest. the idea of suppressing data about automated driving accidents will give manufacturers an opening to avoid safety improvements as it will be easier to brush them under the rug and blame the driver | There are people who are trying to justify this crap, unbelievable.

It is of utmost importance for every driver to know the safety metrics of such systems. It is extremely important that this is regulated properly.

Elon Musk weighs in on Cybertruck door panel gap after reviewer calls it the 'worst I've ever seen in a production vehicle',,1031,695,1711003055,"That reviewer was MKBHD (kind of a big deal) and Musk's weigh in was pretty unsatisfactory. He somewhat implies it's a small issue that doesn't appear often and while this may be true of this EXACT issue the overall fit and finish and build quality of the CT hasn't looked awesome. | It's not a gap, it's part of the new Giga X driver  sideair ventilation system. | Elon tweeted model 3 panel gaps were much worse, where were you looking? | That's not a gap, that's Super Pursuit Mode like in Knight Rider. | Well, poor QC is already a thing in Tesla, isn't it ? If Musk really cares that, he would get more busy in that. | Mind the gap | Tesla's build quality is garbage. My Model 3 has been into the SC on multiple occasions with various issues like rattles, moving seats and condensation in the tail lights. 

Even the mobile techs have told me that their main reason for employment is because of bad build quality. 

All of this was fine when Tesla were leading the market as the only cost effective EV out there with state of the art charging network. Unfortunately for them the big boys are now involved in the EV world and they will eventually eat into Tesla's market share as their tech will eventually catch up.

Couple that with the fact that Tesla keeps removing or omitting things like parking sensors, radar,  rain sensors and stalks that most people want for a good quality of car ownership, these will put them in a more difficult position. 

Having an owner who was once deemed a visionary but now is just an arrogant asshat isn't helping the cause either.

What gets me the most is the fanatical fanboys who are happy to drop >40k on a car but also make excuses for it coming with these kind of issues.

Any way you cut it, this is just mind-bogglingly stupid. How are you going to improve uptime and expand now that you fired the entire department?

And now that you have millions of new BEVs gaining access in the next year, you're going to...slow expansion? And Supercharger uptime is already extremely goodâ€”99.95% [according to Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/NACS). That equates to about 4 hours of downtime per year.

The U.S. does not exist in a vacuum. Ultimately, this isn't likely to end well for American automakers as their now slower shift to electrification will reduce their competitiveness in global markets where similar exclusionary practices don't exist and demand for EVs is increasing.

And solar rooftop and bess installations.,"EV9, EV6, ioniq5/6, F150 lightning subreddits are filled with stories of cars lasting a week on full power homes, longer than week on minimal power usage, and also helping out neighbors.

Gasoline generators are running out of fuel and getting gas is an issue as gas pumps have been flooded and out of commission.

Natural gas utility connected generators are doing a great job, but in some areas gas utilities have stopped pumping gas through the pipes because the pumping station was flooded or has lost power or has been damaged.

People who have only grid tied solar are at a disadvantage because without the grid, their solar isn't working. 

People with solar + battery backup are having a great time (comparatively) as they still have most functions of their home going on. And are helping out neighbors to charge their phones and devices. 

People with EVs have literally become the Joneses in so many neighborhoods, once people are back on their feet, their next car is going to be an EV.

Ford, GM and Hyundai should take this momentum and try to sell many more EVs in Carolinas, and Tennessee(East).",938,397,1728184538,"Hey I'm one of those people who lives in a small town outside Asheville who just powered essential home systems for a full week on a single EV9 charge.

We helped our neighbors who had important perishable items they needed to store in our fridges, let them use our microwaves and air fryers, coffee machines and charge devices up 

Of course the 40+ year old dads of the street were both absolutely thankful for the help and amazed at my and my neighbors lightning being able to produce this much electricity to power up our homes and 1 of them is about to join in as well soon with his lightning he'll pick up next week. he told me he got absolutely sold on the pro power onboard system | [deleted] | I think this storm is an ""inflection point"" where V2L/H/G penetrates from the enthusiast population to the general population. 

But in the same breath, the Tesla fire down in Sarasota is getting just as much media attention and reinforces the negative opinion that a lot of the general population has towards EVs. 

It still think it's a ""net positive"", but I'd be surprised if it moves the needle much. | I'm sure too, that this will push a positive narrative for EVs to have a vehicle to home V2H ability and creating localized power grids. | I drove my Sierra EV from Montgomery to help my mom in Georgia. She's been out of power since it hit and didn't have a generator. I was also towing my wife's old SUV to give to my sister.

Offboard power saved her food the day I arrived. Although I didn't need to, I was able to charge Level 2 at the local Ford dealership when no one was able to buy gas. I charged for a bit mostly because I was concerned about how far I would have to go while towing before I found another charger in a disaster area, but I can go about 300 miles so it wasn't likely to be a big problem.

Dropped off the car in Jacksonville, ended up with an errand to Titusville which is where I found her a generator, and headed back thru. Offboard power again till morning when we had daylight to set up the generator.

Most of the family in the area are EV skeptics. They just had a lot of their misconceptions straightened out. Their line to get gas is hours long. Offboard power overnight didn't lower my battery by a single percent. Towing distance is perfectly doable.

Volkswagen to invest up to $5 billion in EV maker Rivian as part of tech joint venture,,922,197,1719346509,"Not sure which thread will end up being deleted, but here's the text from Reuters.

>Shares in Rivian jumped 22% in after-hours trading.

>The partnership will help Volkswagen accelerate its plans to develop software-defined vehicles (SDV), with Rivian licensing its existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture.

The lack of basic understanding still baffles me.,"Walked out of a work function at a restaurant. All managers. One of them says, ""Look at this Mach E that wanted to park next to a REAL Mustang! (his)"" I politely laugh and tell him it's mine. In my head I'm thinking that he must feel stupid for acting like that only to find out that he's talking to the owner, but imma give grace and try to strike up a normal conversation. I was incorrect. He immediately responds with, ""at least mine doesn't run out of power."" To which I'm so baffled I blurt out, ""you never run out of gas??"" 
The number of times I've been asked what happens when my battery runs out is also surprising. My typical response is to ask what happens when their car runs out or won't move. Ya get towed. Just thought it was funny and kinda wanted to vent. It's probably surprising to some but it's actually the first time I've been made fun of for having an EV. Most people are interested and just ask questions. ",919,420,1716509279,"Um...would your best response be ""I wanted the faster Mustang. My MachE-GT will smoke your Mach 1"" | Don't worry that isn't as bad as what someone at work told me.

But hey I'm not the CEO for Ford so what do i know lol. | I have never encountered explicitly anti-EV types but I've lost count of the number of ""dumb"" questions I've answered repeatedly from people who know very little about EVs. Examples:

* It takes 10+ hours to (L2) charge?! What do you do in that time?
   * I have to explain L2 charging by likening it to downloading a large digital game. You don't idly sit in front of your console like an idiot when waiting for a 100 GB download. You do literally anything else, like eat, work, do chores, play a different game, etc. Since I L2-charge at home, I can do literally anything including sleep!
* it takes 20+ min to DC charge?! Isn't that inconvenient on road trips?
   * You don't use the restroom or buy food during road trip stops?
* Isn't there a danger of ripping out your charger if you forget to unplug before you drive?
   * Do you honestly think the engineers didn't already think about this? 
* It takes so long to L2 charge from empty? What if you need to go somewhere again shortly after arriving home?
   * How often do you come home with a near-empty gas tank? 
* Isn't it cheaper to just buy a used economy car? It'll take you so many years to make back the costs from gas savings.
   * It's even cheaper to just not have a car and ride a bicycle. And then it's cheaper to walk instead of buying a bicycle. Not every purchase needs to be made with extreme frugality in mind. I bought this car for the tech and the fun, not to ""save money"". | i mean, plenty of people think the earth is flat. there are lots of dumb dumbs out there | There is a fair chance that the electric Mustang might be faster.

EVs are taking over the rest of the world much faster than the US,,910,777,1713262366,"The rest of the world doesn't have access to a massive amount of subsidized gasoline. Imagine how ICE vehicles would do, especially the inefficient large ones, if the US didn't subsidize its oil anymore.  I bet the uptake to electric would be much faster. | US Americans like our big SUVs, big pickup Trucks, and we love taking long road trips.

Haven't been to a gas station in 3 months now and I'm just loving it. | The root issue with our slow adoption is, in my opinion, that it's become so politicized.

Because of the non-stop anti-EV conservative propaganda, people are not buying EVs even when they are the best option for them.

We're getting to the point where fewer and fewer people will be about to deny the benefits of EVs, is just slow going. | Part of it is the same reason that broadband is better in other countries... smaller land masses make it easier to deploy new infrastructure, and the other countries wait until gen 2 or gen 3 before they invest. | USA: people favor hybrids. At this juncture, EV just have a difficult time competing against the hybrids.  Not everyone wants or needs 0-60 time of < 6 seconds.   In Q1: Toyota and Honda sold over 90k rav-4 hybrid and CR-V hybrid.  This number will keep growing.  This despite the EV have tax credits and at times are actually cheaper than the hybrids.  The hybrids dampens the gas savings that EV has to offer.    

Europe: I know the article say the rest of the world: just looking at the bar graph: it is really China that has good growth. Europe EV growth looks like it is slowing down as well. The top 2 auto market in Europe: Germany and UK: the growth hasn't been great. 

For further growth to occur: price of EV has to come down more. | Not American.

But the reason I don't have an EV is when I went looking 2 years ago, with the space-range-price criteria, it was a case of 'pick 1'.

Now it's nearly at 'pick 2', hopefully by the time I need a new car in a few years there are cars available. | I say this as an EV owner and enthusiast:

The financial incentive just isn't there yet. Gasoline is still very cheap in most parts of the United States. Last weekend I saw gasoline under three dollars a gallon.

After this year, the cheapest EV in America will be over $30,000. if you go by Dave Ramseys guidelines, you would need an income of at least $60,000 to buy the cheapest EV. if you go by the 20/3/8 rule, you would need an income of over $100,000 to be able to afford the cheapest EV available.

EVs, especially cheap EVs, work best in the city where people are least likely to have access to charging at home. If you can't charge at home then your fuel cost may be the same or even more than that of an ice car.

Although EVs have lower maintenance costs and lower fuel cost (if you can charge at home) the increased depreciation eats into the savings.

Walmart, Harbor freight, Dollar General, and Aldi have shown that if you give people a cheaper alternative, they will buy that instead.

If you want to sell more EVs, make the EVs cheaper or make the ice vehicles more expensive. People forget about politics very quickly when money is involved. The red-blooded Republican in his pickup truck will whine about foreigners but then hire the immigrant landscaper and buy tools made in China because money. | Two things I hate about ICE vehicles that are seldom mentioned are the nasty smelling exhaust fumes, especially from older, illegally modified, or less regulated ICE vehicles like trucks, and the contact your hands come into with gasoline. Neither is good for your health and I look forward to a world where these are extreme rarity. | of course this is true. America has the lowest gas prices relative to income of any nation on earth. | Road trips are the culprit. Americans are always buying a car based on the longest trip they take.

That's why I have a Rav4 Prime and a Model 3.

I'd also say that's not wrong. I am correctly calculating my lost summer vacation from extra charging and it's unacceptable right now.

There's no helping the fact that EV adoption will have to absolutely shove itself down people's throats no matter how superior it becomes.

We did some driving for the various errands while having air conditioning and tossing cords over to our neighbors so they could have refrigeration.  When everybody was panic buying gas and fighting lines before the storm hit, I simply opened the app on my phone and raised the charge limit.

I watched my neighbors struggle with 10 gallon per day rationing and hour long lines.  They had to go through that daily because 10 gallons are just enough to run the generator for 24 hours and then drive to the gas station to wait in line with the remainder.

https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/US?q=4 | Wowzers. I was expecting bad numbers, but even I didn't think deliveries would be that bad! Sales were down massively q/q AND y/y.

They added an additional 46,561 vehicles to inventory AFTER reducing production rates by 61,618 units q/q, 7,437 y/y . Since Q1 2023, they've added a net 83,965 vehicles to inventory. Since Q1 2022, they've added a net 139,725 vehicles to inventory. No doubt some are in transit, but there's also gotta be plenty sitting in lots, no?

Periods of high inventory aren't normally a huge deal for established OEMs with vast dealership networks that buy the cars and get them off the OEMs books, while sharing in the costs of inventory... but that isn't the case for Tesla; those vehicles are on Tesla's books.

The 'Other Models' production figure of 21,000 is interesting. They've almost certainly reduced model S / X production, but if they've ramped to enough 4680 cells to announce enough for 1000 CTs per week on March 20th, why is this production figure so low? They also had already built up an inventory of cells in preparation for CT production. In Q3 last year, before CT production started, they reported the production of 13,700 Model S/X. If that's stayed consistent, then they've only produced about 7300 CTs in 17 weeks. At 1000 CTs per week, it begs the question of why they added 4000 'Other Models' to inventory. That's 4 weeks of CT production; surely they could deliver all but 1 weeks' worth and get them off the books, no? Important as I'll mention below with regards to the drone footage of Austin.

So when's Tesla finally planning to announce the layoffs they've been doing behind the scenes? (at low enough numbers to avoid reporting requirements from the WARN act.)

Let's go over again the list of reasons I was pointing out in Q4 last year of why I believed Tesla's growth wouldn't exceed 15% y/y in 2024 and may actually be 0% or even decline, and they wouldn't get anywhere close to that 50% CAGR goal through 2030:

* High interest rates for longer putting pressure on all new vehicle sales. ~~Unlike other large established OEMs, Tesla doesn't have the ability to offer large interest rate incentives.~~ (Edit: My mistake, Tesla does periodically offer interest rate incentives.   Other OEMs seem to do it far more often and are in fact currently doing it, whereas Tesla currently isn't.)
* Loss of the tax credit on the model 3
* Loss or reduction of the tax credit in Germany and other regions
* Significant demand pull forward into 2023 with their huge discounts and with the impending loss of the credits that would stifle sales in Q1/Q2 2024.
* Weakening auto sector including increasing auto loan delinquencies and credit card delinquencies... no more people stretching to buy expensive vehicles.
* Potentially heading into a recession
* Tech sector job layoffs... their biggest customer base
* Model Y making up 60%+ of their overall sales, allowing other OEMs to target that model with competition and discounts.
* More competition generally in the EV sector.
* Chinese competitors growing significantly faster and offering lower priced vehicles; again targeting the model Y specifically.
* Elon Musk's toxicity... ""which is more profound than it sounds""... How many people can you alienate before you lose a chunk of your customer base. In the past few years, the man's made anti-Semitic, anti-minority, anti-Democrat, pro-Chinese (and by extension anti-American), anti-LGBTQIA+, anti-women, etc...

To add some other big item to this list:

* Rising electricity prices proportional to gas prices. Namely in California; their biggest US market by state.
* Increasing state registration fees to offset losses in road taxes; some early adopters were getting a free ride.

No doubt, many of these items impact all OEMs, but other companies doing badly doesn't justify Tesla's hyperinflated share price.

(Copied from the now deleted thread)

Edit: Corrected a misstatement about interest rate incentives.  See above. | This is based on price.  I don't know why people avoid talking about this.

Last year, you could get a Model 3 for $7500 less from the federal tax rebate.  That's a lot of money.  That's not even talking about the $3000-5000 discounts on in-stock product.  While the Highland may be an improvement, I don't think anyone would argue it's a $7500 improvement, let alone a $10k improvement.

Simply put, Tesla needs to cut prices again if they want to keep selling like they have been.

Otherwise they need to suck it up and live with the fact that these volume numbers are to be expected. | Why does Elon keep working with Trump when Trump is anti EV...

The tax rebates ended on the Model 3, and on top of that the Model Y is now looking a bit outdated after the refresh on the Model 3.

This is almost exactly what I would've expected. And on top of everything, competition against Tesla is finally starting to heat up in the US, and that's great because it will mean more choices for consumers, and even for Tesla customers it will be great because Tesla will need to compete on both prices and features. I wouldn't be surprised to see the cost of things like their enhanced autopilot and full self driving come way down in price.

It's a great time right now to see EV growth in the US, aside from increase competition, we now have a charging standard that all manufacturers will be using, many more chargers opening up to all BEV drivers, and we're going to be seeing higher voltage/faster chargers going forward as well.

Of course there's still a long road forward for people in apartments or that park alongside streets where they live, and much of rural America doesn't have many chargers.

Battery chemistry in leaf changed in late 2013 to be more degradation resistant, my leaf is the first year of the new chemistry, but got slammed with over 1100 fast charges in japan (owner must not have had home charging) before it was imported to NZ, making it in the bottem fifth percentil of 2014 cars.

I don't think most people realize just how fundamentally weak the gasoline supply lines are.

In any kind of civil unrest, gasoline will be gone and unavailable quite quickly. The only way society keeps running as well as it does is through continuous resupply of heavily orchestrated gasoline tanker trucks. Gasoline itself isn't easy to make at any reasonable scale--it's done at huge refineries down south that depend on crude oil being shipped in from elsewhere.

It's fine--it's just inherently fragile. But electricity? We have power plants everywhere, coal and natural gas everywhere, PVs, wind, and hydroelectric all over the place. Even if a civil war or something broke out, we'd still have electricity because it doesn't need to be so centralized.

She regularly echos those talking points. I put it to her this way:

* EV engines are about 3x more efficient than ICE vehicles (bottom line, energy-in vs kinetic energy-out)
* Some more emissions occur creating an EV than ICE, but cars are built to be driven, so after a few years the EV is cleaner
* Even if you charge an EV from a coal power plant, that 3x combined with economies of scale (efficiency & scale of a power plant vs a combustion engine) EVs come out ahead (though margins are smaller here).
* Remember to compare apples to apples: emissions occur extracting, refining, and transporting oil and gasoline.
* My mother has bad asthma so I point out that there's a BIG difference on public health between a coal power plant away from residential areas vs ICE emissions happening in/by neighborhoods, cities, schools, parks, etc.
* Depending on the price of electricity at a home, it can be 3-4x cheaper than for gasoline.
* Maintenance is little to nothing.

I then acknowledge EVs shortcomings/limits:

* Public charging infrastructure is not great but getting better. But, realistically, most people will charge at home 99% of the time.
* Range does drop in winter. But with higher-range vehicles, it's not as big of a deal.
* Lithium mining is something to pay attention to. But lithium and battery recycling looks very promising, so we're hopefully seeing the biggest cost here for initial extraction.
* Price is too high IMO - needs to come down more.
* Prices of electricity at public chargers put it about at par for cost as gasoline for the mile.

I then put it as a choice:

* If you live in an area with cleaner electricity generation, cheap electricity,  high gas prices, and can charge at home this makes most sense - but as this map points out, in just about everywhere in the US you come out ahead with this math.
* If you live in an area with dirtier electricity generation, more expensive electricity, low gas prices, and can't charge at home then it may make less sense - but this map points out this is far less than people may think. | All utilities offer ""Blue Sky"" option to purchase zero emissions sustainable power so the EV is 100% zero emissions.

We're still a long way away from fully autonomous vehicles if FSD is the best they can do. | AKA: Tesla can't hit that price point due to a lack of innovation or production scale, so they're going to pretend the idea of an inexpensive car is dumb.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit
Test drove an EV: I am converted,"Test drove a base VW ID.7 today 

I am 100% onboard. It felt like the future. It was better in every way

I can never go back to ICE vehicles 

",839,485,1724960514,"That was the answer Jim Farley, CEO of Ford gave in an interview. He was asked ""What do you say when people ask you why you drive an EV?"" His answer was simply ""Drive one and you'll know"". The CEO of Ford. | Butts in seats is the best way to convert people! | That's literally all it takes... a test drive to be sold and it doesn't have to be one of the fast EV's either. | ONE OF US | One of us, one of us! | So many people could be converted this way. It's crazy how strong the ""gas = power"" association is. People think of electric and imagine a little toy car or a golf car or something. But when you're pumnping 200+ kW through an electric motor or two, it starts to get intense. | I've had an ID.4 for two months and I already hate driving ICE vehicles. | It's such a breath of fresh air when you drive it for the first time. My initial test drives blew my mind. 

What other cars are on your list? | Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH)is probably one of the most immediately noticeable differences when transitioning from an ICE vehicle to an EV. | 2013, test-drove a Leaf, I was sold.

I think it's time to update the narrative on why people buy electric vehicles,"Hey guys, I posted something similar in the Rivian group a few months back, but given I've been having a discussion about this in the comments here, I thought it could be an interesting talking point. 

&#x200B;

I drive a Rivian R1S and live in Texas, more specifically, Houston, oil country. I just had my 5th person tell me how dirty the process of making electric cars, blah blah blahâ€¦.. so I told him:

Look, the clean energy' aspect is like 7 on the list of why I got this. I got it cause it can survive the rubicon trail and smoke a Lamborghini urus and mid level Ferrari while my kids wave to the driver in their car seats in the third rowâ€¦. And all for under $100k

&#x200B;

Can we all admit that, for many of us, the reason for purchasing an electric car has changed? It's no longer purchased exclusively by people who care about green energy or environmental issues. We can now purchase a vehicle that moves our kids comfortably and has the performance of an elite sports car, and way more storage.... and I charge it for less than what I filled up my first car for in the 90's. All in all, we buy them cause they're just awesome cars. Period.  

I know there are many people who just want to spew the garbage they hear on their favorite ""news"" show, but I've found changing the way I discuss it with many has at least made them silent if not changed their opinion at least slightly.... especially when they get in my car and I floor it ðŸ˜‰.",835,968,1705494342,"I drive an EV because I like the car. It's cheaper to charge vs gas and less maintenance. Those were mostly the reasons. It's funny some people think it's a whole politicial choice to buy a EV and make a big deal of stuff that isn't even on my mind when purchasing. | It's amazing how everyone is a huge environmentalist when talking about how they don't like EVs. 

I just say, I like the car. I don't care about what you drive, why would you care about what I drive? | Exactly. I do care about environmental impact but it's not the reason I bought the car.  I have a 100 mile commute to work 4 days a week and was tired of paying over $200/month in gas, plus the 5 or so oil changes per year.  I can charge for free at work and charging at home is cheap.  It was a no brainer. | I still like that it's powered by (where I live) mainly wind- and solar power. And I appreciate that EVs don't spread exhaust fumes in cities when I'm out walking, it's not a smell I'm a fan of.

I didn't buy the car because of that, but I still think it's nice. | Another reason that I didn't even know at first. Once I went all electric on cars and yard equipment, my garage smells so much better. | Environment wasn't my first reason.  But sure feels good not buying gas and pre heat/cooling with remote start is guilt free. | For those of us who do strongly believe EVs are a crucial tool for fighting climate change I'm glad they're now good enough for people to want them just because they're so good.

We were never going to get to mass adoption on guilt alone. Not even close. Being a better vehicle than an ICE is the only path forward. | I dont know if anything has changed.  Ive owned an electric car since 2015 and green was never the reason.   My reasons:   no maintenance,  no gas station trips, no transmission to clunk through when I hit the pedal, and quiet.

At the end of the day the narrative put out by the media is going to be whatever sells captures eyes for ads.   They have found this narrative and they are going to stick with it until it stops generating clicks.  Meanwhile EVs keep taking market share. | Really, electric cars are clearly superior to gas powered cars technically. If you can save the environment at the same time then be my guest. | My reasons are simple, and perhaps even here, controversial:

1. Cheaper to drive than my F150 as a daily driver. This is DEFINITELY #1.  I went from paying 100/week for gas to about $40 a week for ""the juice.""
2. I am not a ""car guy"" but love tech. So the Tesla meets THAT need/desire
3. I love the supercharger availability nationwide for the Tesla, and I love to travel (it's why I also have the truck with the Kimbo camper.)
4. I don't decide to like something, or dislike it, because of the CEO, so I stuck with the decision to get a Tesla.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

EV sales are growing. So why are automakers getting cold feet?,,825,538,1725548873,"In addition to all the forces working against them, we're in the trough of disillusionment in the Gartner hype cycle or the chasm for technology adoption.  We're at the stage where the rate of growth is slowing among early adopters, but haven't hit critical mass among the rest of the later adopters.

Rather than think long term and push through this, many automotive companies are pulling back. | [deleted] | These initial, all-in on EVs announcements were to bolster company stock prices.  Everyone was doing it as they saw Tesla's market cap go up and up.  It worked for them initially, until reality set in. | Because sales are not profits.

The big reason EV sales are still growing is because automakers had to cut prices, otherwise sales would have plunged and factories would have been left fully idle. But with EVs selling at cut prices, manufacturers no longer make strong profits, and aren't expecting to make strong profits as soon as they were originally hoping. So now we see an adjustment â€” reduced expectations and reduced roadmaps as OEMs take a sober second look and re-adjust. You can't just have sales â€”you need profits, too. 

Simple as that. | I don't think any of this is particularly surprising. It reminds me of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Home internet access had been growing steadily since the early 1990s, and many companies believed that they could make big money as people figured out how to monetize it. That led to over-investment and, eventually, a bust. 

I remember articles in the early 2000s claiming that the internet was interesting but would never amount to much,  that it was just a fad, and that nobody would ever make any serious money online. I'd post sources but there are very many of them and they're easy to search up. 

I'm not saying EVs will follow exactly the same curve, but I think we've seen the pattern before. Slow but accelerating growth, excitement and over-investment, followed by a decline. I still think EV adoption will accelerate over the next several years and we'll have more EVs and hybrids on the road by 2035 than ICE vehicles. | Oil companies pushing back hard. Gas prices dropping in spite of two major wars, only one of which has been enough to spike gas prices in the past. | Legacy ICE automakers have the classic dilemma where their ICE business is profitable while their EV business is not (and many times significantly losing money).  So every EV they sell, they lose money while an ICE sale would have brought in profit.  They probably thought they would have more time to transition, but China has really ramped up quickly and growing globally. | -Make mediocre cars-

They over shot their estimates so pulling back to be more in line with the current growth. They are not cutting production just cutting planned  increase production. | If a company would come out with an EV that would be just a simple vehicle and not require electricity to even power a door handle of the glove box for an affordable priceâ€¦.that would be great.

With washroom and convenience store services on site already, its an easy pivot. And as each site needs tank overhauls, they can get rid of the gas pumps a little at a time.

My EV is now 10 years old. Pros and Cons of owning an EV long-term.,"Specifically, I own a 2014 Tesla Model S 85 and live in the suburbs of a southeastern US city.

**The good news:**

* **Range:** Battery was originally rated at 265 miles and got about 245 in real world driving conditions. Today, it will show about 240 miles of range at a full charge and will actually go about 215-220. So, only about 10% degradation over 10 years. I should note that the car has been in a warm, southeastern climate for its entire life so far. Granted, there are several new EVs that will go 300+ miles on a single charge, but just in terms of degradation, it hasn't been bad at all. Also, I find that I only take about 2 trips per year that require more range than my car provides. On those trips, we take my wife's ICE SUV, but it really wouldn't be that big a deal if we only owned EVs. We could plan our trips accordingly or just rent a car for long trips.
* **Tech still seems modern:** I assumed my car would quickly become a dinosaur as newer models would offer features that blew mine away. But that hasn't been the case, at least not yet. Although I just have auto-pilot rather than full self-driving, I don't feel like its dated. Granted, I upgraded to the new infotainment system a few years ago when I had to replace the main touchscreen, but the old one was still pretty useful. Navi, streaming media, autopilot, lots of remote features, keyless entry and start, backup camera, lane departure warnings and traffic sensors, heated seats, power everything, programmable, auto-folding mirrors, voice commands for most apps, etc. are all reasonably close to what new cars have to offer, except that I don't have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. That said, I tend to use Tesla's navi and streaming services anyway, so it's no biggie. Plus, it helps that, as long as you don't need new hardware, the software upgrades and bug fixes can be downloaded remotely and automatically.
* **Charging:** I own a home and therefore have easy access to level 2 charging in my garage. I rarely need a supercharger, but when I do, they seem to be plentiful and easy to find. Supercharging does take longer than a stop at a gas station and speed depends on how many others are charging at the same time, but it usually takes me about 40-45 mins to go from 20-80%. A ton of charging stations are located in places where you can shop or eat while you wait, and I've never had to wait more than a couple mins for a spot to open-up. Plus, there are apps that will tell you whether the supercharging station has open slots that aren't already in use. Also, having adapters means I can use whatever network is available. Plus, I must be grandfathered or something because I've never paid for a charge at a Tesla station. It's always been free.
* **Driving experience:** The overall experience of driving an EV is, in my opinion, superior to an ICE vehicle and that's not just true of Teslas, but for many other brands and models I've driven as well. It's smooth, quiet, acceleration is exceptional, handling tends to be very nimble, there's little or no body lean in the turns, it climbs hills with ease, and aside from the fire risk associated with lithium ion batteries, they tend to be safer in accidents, probably because there's no engine in front of the driver which I assume allows the entire front of the car to act as a crumple zone.
* **Shorter commutes:** This is more a product of government incentives than the car itself, but I live in an area with a lot of toll or HOV lanes that I can access, for free, as an EV owner, even when I'm the only one in the car. That significantly reduces my commute time in heavy traffic.
* **Brakes are still good:** The car is 10 years old, yet I haven't had to replace the brakes because I don't use them much. With regenerative breaking, it's almost a one-foot driving experience.

**The bad news:**

* **Expensive, out-of-warranty repairs:** It's amazing how everything seems to go wrong once the warranty expires, and I've had to replace both the 17"" main touchscreen and the driver instrument cluster due to faulty glue on the screen that eventually bubbles and seeps out. I also had to spend more than you would expect to fix a squeaky rear suspension and I had a couple minor issues like a door handle that wouldn't ""present"" and excessive vibration in the sound system which I fixed myself. In total, I've probably spent just shy of $6,000 on repairs and all of that has been within the last 4 years. But, over the 10-year lifespan of the car so far, maybe that's about normal since all my issues are mechanical or electronic rather than having any engine repairs.
* **Tire life:** My car goes through tires almost twice as fast as my ICE cars have. Seems to be a common issue for EV owners due to the increased weight.
* **Service:** It can take weeks or even a month to get a service appointment and the service centers are so backed-up that they often don't have loaners available. This experience may improve with the brands that have dealerships all over the country and especially when we get to a point where parts are available through your local garage and there are actually enough trained mechanics. But for now, Tesla owners rely almost entirely on the Tesla service centers and DIY. Fortunately, (knock on wood), I've never had an issue where my car was undrivable, so waiting for weeks to get service has been more of an annoyance than anything debilitating.
* **Others can't hear you:** I've adjusted to this over time, but when navigating parking lots or other congested areas with lots of pedestrians, it's important to remember that they can't hear you because the car is silent. To this day, I frequently experience situations where someone will be walking in front of my car, just completely oblivious that I'm even there. It's a safety issue and can be a tad annoying in terms of parking lot etiquette.

**Neutral:**

* **Total cost of ownership:** This is a moving target due to increased competition, changes in federal rebate programs, an unpredictable resale market, widely fluctuating gas and home electricity prices, etc. But for the most part, I think long-term EV ownership has come out about even with an ICE vehicle in the same class. The higher up-front purchase price and higher cost for mechanical repairs and insurance have been offset by savings on gas, tolls, and oil changes and the lack of engine maintenance. I'm interested to see how this plays-out for vehicles that get into the 200,000+ mile range, but I tend to think EVs will perform well, even in old-age. After all, the batteries are designed to go 500,000 miles and, with no engine repairs, the vehicle itself should hold-up well over time. The downside is that, with so many new EV models hitting the market over the next few years, and car companies being aggressive to drive adoption and market share, that could erode resale values for older EVs.

**Overall verdict:**

* It has its pros and cons, especially since I own an early generation model that probably hadn't had all the bugs and problems worked-out yet, but I find EVs in general to just be a superior technology to ICE vehicles, and when I eventually replace my current EV, which may still be 2-3 years from now, I plan to get another one.",810,346,1704471409,"Good write up.

Hertz To Sell Off Even More EVs As Depreciation Losses Mount,,784,431,1714199249,"Rental companies never figured out how to recharge the cars. Expecting 70-80% refill after a rental is just utter brainless take | If they invested in Hertz branded charging stations in key locations this wouldnt have happened. | It was so weird renting a Tesla, and no one walking me through anything. | because they did a shit job of the rollout. | I don't think it's purely depreciation, unless they think it will get much worse this year. Likely also has to do with the expectation that they won't be able to charge as much for rentals as they were expecting. | Ev's dont make a lot of sence for rental companies..... Fuel costs are lower (which the customer pays) initial price and depreciation is higher (which rental companies pays) . They could run the cars longer and let them get to higher milages, but then the business model of buying cars in bulk for cheap and selling them for a relatively high price would not work anymore....... In other words, they're struggling to convert their business model | All the comments about recharging policy and onboarding experience are missing the point.


When these rental companies first started buying their EV fleets, they expected a fairly normal depreciation curve where each EV could be sold in a few years for $X on the used market. They set their rental prices to make sure they could cover that depreciation. Then two things happened:


1. As more Tesla competitors showed up, Tesla kept saying, ""Welcome to the party, BTW, we have enough margin in our Model 3/Y to drop our prices enough to make your EVs nigh-unsellable... plus some tweaks to keep tax incentives intact.These moves kept Tesla factories and sales chugging along but made the used EV depreciation curves steeper.


2. The up-to-$4k tax credit for used EVs up to $25k came along. Suddenly there's a ton of extra pressure on used EV prices to keep them within that threshold.


Because of 1 & 2, the depreciation curves that rental companies had planned their prices around became more like depreciation cliffs. They can't adjust their business models fast enough to react to this stuff, so they're packing up their toys and leaving the EV space. | I have no idea why they thought rental EVs would be a thing.  If you are renting a car, you are probably on a trip away from home, maybe driving long distances, and possibly staying at hotels.  The last thing you want to have to do is a lot of work thinking about how not to be stranded someplace.  I have a road trip to a remote area this summer, and will be renting a car specifically because I don't want to drive my EV. | I'm ready to be down voted, but EVs as rentals don't make much sense for me. Especially when the infrastructure is spotty and unreliable and a lot of cars have shitty charging speeds. Hertz was renting Bolts(!) SMH.


Owning/leasing An EV makes sense coz you can make arrangements to charge at night and most folks don't drive too far on a daily basis. Both of which are hard to do when you're renting.


Was there so much demand for EV rentals that Hertz bought so many of them? | Hertz has 35,000 cars for sale right now. 1,500 of them are Teslas. And that does seem higher than normal since I've gone on that site in the past and there was only about 900. 

But let's be clear, Hertz is always selling used cars of every manufacturer. It is part of their business model. It is just weird that they are selling a Tesla that has under 20,000 miles.

That will do! | This is an interesting, if somewhat non-standard, way of view the market so let's take a look under the hood.

This should be China's peak global market share, it sure looks spike-ish on a graph!

Back in 2017, peak new ICE vehicle sales and one of the last pre-Covid normal years, the market sold 95 million new light vehicles.  China sold 30%, the US 18%, the EU 17%, with the Rest Of the World (ROW) with 35%

China's EV growth rate continues unabated but both the EU and US  have basically stalled over the last year and a half but this is about to end, and ROW will finally show up in the stats.

China's EV market share is up to the low 50% range and should grow to 75% by the end of 25. That seems to be in line with the government plan so nothing totally unexpected is happening.  The EU plugin market share is stuck at about 24% due to incentives going away as cheaper plugins finally hit the market and emission rules are tightened.  The US's 11% growth is on a low base and so doesn't move global stats much.

The EU plugin market should grow to at least 30% in 2025 and hitting 35% is not to be ruled out.  The US should at least hit 20% but the real star of the show is going to be R0W. 

The reasoning works this way: China plugin makers want to export as many vehicles as they sell domestically; they can't export to US or EU because tariffs; ROW countries for the most part don't produce oil or have an auto industry to protect so cheap China EVs are selling like hotcakes. Australian consumers are happy since car prices are coming down. Ethiopia having neither oil nor cars banned the import of all ICE vehicles and has no import tariffs on EVs. The government is looking at saving all that fossil fuel subsidy money.

(Emphasis on *percentage* because, in pure numbers, SFH residents outnumber multifamily housing residents.) 

So, as a group, multifamily residents are more likely to be interested in switching to BEV, despite being less likely to have charging access where they regularly park.

"VW CEO: ""One thing is clear: the future of mobility in Europe is electric""",,761,146,1732022788,"Translation:

Volkswagen brand boss Thomas SchÃ¤fer has commented on the challenges facing the company and the industry in general on the online career network LinkedIn. He also made demands on politicians.

These are challenging times, he said, and the future of Germany as an industrial location and the leading automotive industry is at stake. Volkswagen is a particular focal point for both. We must act!' said SchÃ¤fer. And now. The vehicle market in Europe is shrinking, the ramp-up of e-mobility is stalling. The abolition of the environmental bonus has led to a slump in demand in Germany and unsettled private customers. At the same time, we have to create the economic basis in our company to ensure that we can continue to finance and drive forward the major technological transformation from our own resources.'

One thing is clear: the future of mobility in Europe is electric,' emphasised the manager. And our aim at VW is to inspire our customers with the best electric cars.' The company already offers a broad portfolio ranging from the compact ID.3, which currently costs less than 30,000 euros, to the long-distance ID.7 saloon with a range of over 700 kilometres. Further e-cars from VW for under 25,000 and under 20,000 euros will follow in the next few years.

For this type of drive system to become truly attractive for everyone, politicians - or I say quite deliberately: a new federal government at the latest - must create the right framework conditions,' demanded SchÃ¤fer. Because in Germany, we don't have a supply problem with e-mobility, we have a demand problem. This is where politics can help!'

Specifically, according to the manager, what is needed are tax incentives for commercial and private customers, favourable prices for public charging and a reliable, comprehensive charging network throughout Europe, a competitive ecosystem for the entire e-mobility sector including raw materials, battery cell production and recycling, as well as new flexibilities within the existing CO2 regulations that actually allow manufacturers to achieve their targets and give customers security.

We now need a joint effort to ensure that we don't fall behind China and the USA,' emphasised SchÃ¤fer. It is in Germany's interest that the automotive industry continues to have a competitive domestic market and attractive location conditions in the future. We must fight for this now!' | Build (and support) BEVs that outlast ICEVs and HEVs and many more will adopt BEVs, be it new or in the secondary market.

Profiles with a Ford show the NACS-adapter compatible now, while other CCS-natives just show the MagicDock SC's; both as expected. Neat. 

At least from the app perspective, it looks like Tesla is ready to flip the switch for more manufacturers.

Really nice to finally see an official map of where the NACS-compatible SC's are. 

Great day for all EV's in the US! | Ford app has been updated to include plug and charge at Tesla SCs, does say adapter required, but the adapter was made available for free this morning to Ford EV owners. | Someone needs to specify a Ford EV in the Tesla app and make an attempt to charge another brand with a NACS adapter.  The big question is whether Tesla is locking adapter access to MAC addresses from specific manufacturers, if that's even possible. | Here I come with my lightning to take up two spots!! | >A Supercharging Membership allows EV owners to Supercharge at the same price as Tesla vehicle owners when using the Tesla app. If you are a Tesla vehicle owner, you do not need a Supercharging Membership.

Confirmation of a price difference. Interesting. | I suspect I'll be busier at the SCs as everyone tries them out to make sure/sees how they work. | Given that this is only for Ford, at the moment, and Kia/Hyundai don't even have a projected access date yet for NACS Superchargers, here is my EV6-shaped silver lining:

At least, with this change, it will quickly become much less likely that Mach-e and F-150 Lightning owners will be using the EA fast chargers I usually like to stop at.  That should help reduce traffic to them and make life a bit better for folks like me.  It'll get a LOT better once GM gets access later in Spring '24, as Bolts are both really common (as far as non-Tesla EVs go) and are usually vehicle throughput bottlenecks at any charging station.

Rivian is revising its annual production guidance to be between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles. The company is also reaffirming its annual delivery outlook of low single digit growth as compared to 2023, which it expects to be in a range of 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles.*  
  
We have to wait till November 7th after markets close for their numbers to filed. This will not be pretty. The question that needs addressed is the large percentage of units not delivered. It is an operational issue or interest issue? We will get hints if their changes to manufacturing have brought them closer to breaking even on production    
    
Key to understand the issue before Rivian is that outside of their well publicized difficulty in making a profit on each vehicle sold they spend nearly a billion a quarter just running the company. Just do the math. Fifty thousand vehicles sold cannot pay for a company costing nearly four billion a year to run. Even fifty thousand a quarter cannot produce sufficient margins.  All that is means is no longer losing money or each vehicle sold cannot fix the problem.  I suspect to reach R2 production another offering has to come about. I really want to see R2s out there but its not looking good. | They need to lower prices in order to attract more customers but they are still selling vehicles at a loss so lowering prices would only increase the hole in their balance sheet. 

I think Rivian has some very nice flagship vehicles but they need high volume low cost vehicles to achieve profitability. | Rivian is selling about 50,000 vehicles a year which is 0.31% of the US car market. Having a supply shortage at that run rate is sus. | This bums me out because I like Rivian a lot. Far more than Tesla as their interior setup isn't ridiculous. They make the vehicles I find most appealing but it's so hard to actually get to check them out and do test drives. 

I think Tesla did it right by making it super easy to check out their vehicles even without service centers. A large mall by us still has a Tesla studio that does test drives and it's been there for years even before Tesla was allowed to have a service/delivery center in our state. | Apple should buy them. | The parts shortage is so stupid.

* With 560 km projected WLTP and 300 mi projected EPA, this essentially obsoletes the current Niro in almost every way assuming that using an EV platform allows them to make the EV3's front end stubbier than the Niro's but still having the same interior space. The Niro will have to get larger for the next generation for it to have a place in Kia's lineup moving forward, IMO.
* This sizing also puts it dangerously close to the Soul / Soul EV. I think the jury's out whether we will see an ""EV2"" underneath this, though Kia does sell smaller cars like the Picanto in global markets.
* $35,000 USD starting price is great, $50,000 top of range price is most certainly not great. IIRC the Bolt EUV maxed out in the high $30Ks / very low $40Ks before the tax credit even with Super Cruise.

I can see why the brakes fail the test after a couple of years. They will fail the test when enough corrosion is visible on the discs.

* Suspension = faulty suspension arms that are covered by warranty, the minority here.

From my experience having owned two ev so far since May 2019, first a 3 and now in a model Y since Dec 2023. Zero HV battery issues. | Key takeaways: 

For cars older than 2015, replacement rates are 13%, but under 1% for cars from 2016 and newer. 

Furthermore, as we can see in the chart, starting in 2016, there was a step change in the battery replacements due to failures, excluding recalls. It was as high as 0.5% starting in 2016, but in most cases, it was from 0.1% to 0.3%. That's an order of magnitude improvement | That number is actually a lot higher than I would have expected. | That's one out of every 40 EVs - that's a lot higher than expected. The editorial use of the word just in the headline is misleading. | Anecdotally, out of our three EVs, two of them have had a battery replacement under warranty. 

2022 Lucid Air GT - Complete high voltage system failure and warranty replacement at 12k miles.

2022 Volvo C40 - Full battery warranty replacement at 9k miles.

2022 Polestar 2 - Totally reliable, currently has 31k miles on it and the battery still seems new.

There's no sense in pretending that these types of early production issues don't exist, plenty of first gen EVs are going through the same thing. | I'm about to replace the 70% capacity original in our 2013 Leaf with a 62kWh pack out of a 2022 Leaf.  Seriously excited to go from 60 miles to 200+ miles.

But the original pack has held up remarkably well.  I believe it's because we never used the 50kW charging option and only ever charged at home. | This man drove his Tesla Model S 440,000 miles before needing a battery replacement, and he regularly DC Fast Charged.

The percentage of battery replacements means nothing, as the methodology for getting to that number is not explained. There is an infographic that shows battery recalls in blue vs other changeouts in green, but no explanation if recalls are included in the 2.5% number or not. | For models 2016 and newer, it drops to less than 1%. Not bad. Shows that quality has improved from the initial generations as expected with a product in general. | No mention of where they got their numbers from. Just that they got data on 20k cars.

The Federal government might want to poop on the parade but, if people want them, they will get them. | Apparently states rights only matter if you're doing evil shit. | the new administration is literally ""We drank shit contaminated water growing up and we liked it, now you need to do the same, stop drinking clean water."" | Gas is too cheap elsewhere in USA | Gas is 6 dollars a gallon in California.

People don't think of it this way, but the tax credit has actually moved quite a bit of EV manufacturing to the US (which has always been one of Trump's stated goals).

"Rant: Charging Experience for 500mi Road Trip, Or Why I Want to Go Back to Horsedrawn Carriages","I'm a professional User Experience designer. This experience caused anger for me in a way I'm not sure many people would understand. It's just incompetence. That's it. These are bad experiences we've had solutions for FOR DECADES. 

 Apps **REQUIRED** to complete my road trip:

- Plugshare (to find chargers, Google maps often misses them)

Then, to charge at various chargers, each with own accounts to set up, half with having to ""load"" cash on a prepaid card which means I just have cash sitting in this arbitrary account that I can't do anything with, and only half accept credit cards:

- Chargepoint

- CircleK Charging

- EVGo

- Shell Recharge

- Electrify America

- Francis Energy 

Experience: 2/5. Chaos, frustration, stupidity. 

**Night Time Usability:** None of the pumps had sufficient lighting so I was often out in the dark with my flashlight trying to see what the hell I'm supposed to do. 

**System Status**: Then, the apps show them working, but upon visiting, it's out of commission--or the speed is not as advertised. 

**Misleading Speed:** My favorite are the ""xkW (Shared)"" chargers. They're actually half the speed they advertise. It's Megabit/Megabyte all over again. Intentionally misleading. 

**Appaggeddon:** I'm coming from this as a former Tesla owner where all of those apps above are replaced with: The Tesla App. Nothing else. All of these apps you see need to have account information, payment information. Etc. 

**Hello Year 2008:** Not only that, but **they don't even support auto fill of your payment methods.** Here I am in the dark, getting rained on, angling my credit card to the light so I can see and manually type in my credit card information, like a god damn neanderthal. 

**Tap Card, But Not That One:** They have these great features where you can tap your credit card to charge. Oh wait. No they don't! Actually, it's some kind of dumb ass membership card. No credit card machine. But it doesn't say that at all until you try to tap, and it runs your card, then spits out ""no account found."". Nice job, guys. Excellent work as always. Keep it up. 

**We're the Main Character:**

It was clear that every company is trying to reinvent the same solution over and over again with some boneheaded stupidity thrown into it or some kind of ""hey look at me with my cool app!"". I don't care! It's a piece of shit. You don't know how to make apps. You don't know why you should make apps. This isn't 2009 where apps are novel. I'll use your pump once on the way, then a different company, then a different company. The infrastructure doesn't support me going ""well I only use Chargepoint *pushes up glasses* because they have the most pure electrons"". 

**Thank God You Have QR Codes:**

Jesus fuck. The QR codes spit out a four or five digit NUMERIC code. Are you FUCKING kidding me? What is the point?!?! Of all things to give me a QR code for, typing four or five god damn digits is the least of my problems with these idiotic machines. No, absolutely not, why would you think to give me a QR code to easily install your dumbass app? Nah, that'd be silly. 

**Get BP+, to Raise Your BP:**

I don't want an app for my gas station. You're not offering me a service that's improved by the app whatsoever, other than you harvesting my data. You're not a tech company. No one cares about you. It's a pain in the ass to fuck with. 

It's effectively a gas pump. That's it. It's not hard. Just make a fucking gas pump for electricity. My God. 

**To be absolutely clear: this isn't ""anti-EV"". This is anti runaway capitalism, or put another way: anti-idiocy. We effectively have hundreds of micro governments each equally as inept as the previous one.** This is not Anti-EV. It's Anti-Charging Company. They fucking suck. All of them. All. Of. Them.

**The Future:**

Hopefully this new infrastructure bill fixes this bullshit. But I have never been more frustrated trying to have a road trip. Just insanity. If I'm not mistaken, the new bill includes requirements for the pumps to have credit card swipers. That alone will improve this experience by ten fold.

An app should never be required to charge a car. | Good rant. And a major reason why adoption beyond Tesla is going to be so, so hard. Even that I'm sure is a PITA if you have never done it before.


Just bloody let us tap-to-pay damn it. No internet at pump? Record the CC and do a nightly batch on dial-up like the machines have done for fucking half a century.

I refuse to download most apps just so you can harvest my data when I can just visit your website to accomplish the same thing.

Your experience seems discriminatory towards the poor and elderly. What if they don't have a smart phone? What if they don't have unlimited data? What if their provider doesn't have good coverage at the location? What if they can't afford to prepay for each charging ecosystem? | Haha, I'm a design researcher, also with an EV and did a giant study on EV road-trips recently. The apps are atrocious - the problem is 1) each charger wants you to download their app so they can track/use your data 2) they are built by engineers and product people who don't seem to understand at all how and why people travel long distances in EVs. 

I am surprised you only used PlugShare for the travel part - I'm also always using A Better Route Planner (which is like the definition of an engineering-led product; with their user behavior assumptions being so so bad)

I hope it gets better soon - but I see experience being devalued with designers and researchers laid off so I think the engineering-led decisions will continue sadly | Wish I could upvote this post 100x. Perfectly captures the current state of charging hell driven by corporate greed, hubris, and lack of effective regulation. | Horse-drawn carriages never saw anything near the level of adoption that cars do today.

Yet even at that modest level, city streets were festering sewers of horseshit and flies. Crews had to continually clean streets. When it rained or snowed, you'd get horseshit soup, ankle deep.

The US Now Has 1 Fast EV Charging Station for Every 15 Gas Stations,,730,184,1713549284,"That's actually pretty good | I've travelled back and forth across the US and was always amazed that there was Tesla Super Charger nearby.  We went to Caprock Canyons State Park in Texas in the middle of nowhere, and there was a Super Charger in Childress just several miles away.  There was another in St. Quanah too.   Neither are anywhere near Interstates.

Even better, we stayed at a cabin that had free EV charging.  We stayed for a week and also went to Palo Duro Canyon, and never had to ""fill up"" because we charged overnight. 

I love that my car can tell me where the nearest charger is and how many stalls are open. | https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/the-us-now-has-a-fast-ev-charging-station-for-every-15-gas-stations

The actual article. 

What this article (and analysis) misses is that a location with 2 DC fast chargers is in no way, shape, or form the equivalent of a gas station, if for no other reason than the average gas station in the US has 8 peds capable of refueling 16 vehicles at the same time.

Bloomberg's estimate of 120k gas stations times 16 simultaneous vehicles means that, worst case scenario, you can refuel 1.9MM vehicles simultaneously. 

That is leaps and bounds more than what's even imaginable for EV quick charging. 

Hell, when's the last time you saw a line for gas other than a Costco? | Which seems pretty good already when most people will charge most often at home or maybe work. | That's shockingly high! Now if like to see the ratio of plugs to pumps. And where are these stations? I hardly see any. | Good. Keep it up. | That's actually quite impressive if you dial those numbers back just 10 years ago | And yet we need more. | I think a great EV incentive would be government significantly or totally subsidizing installation of a home charger, even if you rent.  Sure, we need charging infrastructure along the highways but MOST people by far just need to charge at home.  MOST people don't drive more than 30 miles or so per day, certainly not hundreds.  If we just get chargers at home, MOST EV charging becomes a non-issue.  Could potentially do this at higher rate/subsidy for domestic autos.  Many landlords wouldn't mind having someone else upgrade their property for future renters.  Plus this would be a great financial boon for local installers all over the country, getting them on board with EV's.  This way we'd eventually have chargers at most residences, (just like electric outlets or washing machine hookups).  Simple, fair, effective. | My personal experience with EV road trip. I drove from Des Moines, Iowa to Oaklahoma City, in the winter with good weather but cold. Normal leisurely drive of about 9 hours with  conventional vehicle.

It's been great for me and I am sure those business appreciate my money. | I like the article but the thinking is already dated.  EV chargers are not only good for business but are also becoming a good business.

The secret 'sauce' is chargers + storage seasoned with commercial TOU, Time Of Use, electricity rates with a good side of fast charging and slower, 15 minute, charging and a bit of magic. 

The magic is this bit of fun with numbers: divide the current price/kWh of battery cell in pennies, currently 5000 US cents/kWh in China by the product of 20 years and 365.25 days per year and out pops the magic number 0.6845. That' a cost for each kWh handled by the system over it lifetime.

The business case comes from ConEd's cheapest TOU rate of 1.9 cents. Add in the magic number and it's 2.5845 cents per kWh. The battery packaging, which includes battery management hardware and software, brings the price of cells from $50/kWh to $75/kWh a 50 percent markup.  That drive ups the cost of electricity sold to just under 3 cents in NYC. Now consider that the typical gas station makes a profit of 6% on gasoline or about 15 cents/gallon for a max of a couple of bucks per fill-up, the equivalent for an EV is about 30kWh, so sell at 33 cents/kWh and make a $9 dollar profit, sell at 23 cents/kWh and make a $6 dollar profit, sell for cheaper and you won't have enough charger space to satisfy demand.

Beyond that I've noticed that gas stations are attracting fast food franchises so I expect the typical gas station convenience store side to become more like 7-eleven with coffee, muffins, soft drinks, hotdogs and such.

That's the gas station.  The local strip mall is also due for an upgrade. Anchor them with a mini mart at one end and family restaurant/pub at the other and fill it the middle bits with the usual supects, a convenience store, a pharmacy, a dry cleaners, a post office and such. Toss in some fast food stuff like pick up/delivery pizza joint, a burger/wrap with fries joint, Chinese food restaurant and such.  Add in a place that accepts deliveries for you and something like a food court/cafeteria setup for prepared meals to take home.

A lot of communities are mostly residential buildings with no/little possibility of installing charging, the local strip mall/gas station is the logical place for workarounds. These place also tend to be distributed pretty much like the population and so make ideal colocation sites for utilities looking to avoid upgrading local peak demand capacity. | Seems like a no brainer.  99% of the time when fast charging I am going inside the nearby businesses.

The only batteries that are going to recycling in any relevant numbers are those that are diagnosed as faulty during QA testing directly at the factory - and all the big battery players (BYD, CATL, LG,...) have their own recycling companies in-house to recycle that valuable material at the source.

The only batteries that are currently coming in from the field are those from crashed vehicles and those from intense lab testing - and that's not much.

Transaction prices are not a good metric to judge price parity because they are **incredibly** specific / subjective based on location and timing. Person A in big city California might get a $4,000 discount on one of many inventory Kia EV6s, while Person B buying from Joe Stealership's hometown Kia dealer in their small rural town that only has the one EV6 on the lot might not get incentives even close to that.

When comparing using MSRPs, we are not yet close to parity, especially when comparing similarly-equipped ICEs and EVs from the same brand. | Unfortunately, as the article notes, [this is still based on average transaction price - not an equivalent ICE car and EV.](https://i.imgur.com/Sd23exz.png)

Average is useful when there's a nice standard distribution, but transaction price has it's floor at ~20k and the ceiling at some couple of million dollars.

>The recommendations, which have not been previously reported, come as the U.S. electric-vehicle transition stalls and China's heavily subsidized EV industry continues to surge, in part because of its superior battery supply chain.

>The transition team also recommends imposing tariffs on all battery materials globally, a bid to boost U.S. production, and then negotiating individual exemptions with allies, the document shows.

>Taken together, the recommendations are a stark departure from Biden administration policy, which sought to balance encouraging a domestic battery supply chain, separate from China, with a rapid EV transition. The transition team plan would redirect money now flowing to building charging stations and making EVs affordable into national defense priorities, including securing China-free supplies of batteries and the critical minerals to build them.

This'll be a spicy take around here, but focusing on domestic EV supply chains and battery refining from a national security perspective is not inherently a bad policy position - **in concept.**

That being said, as usual, the incoming Trump Administration's proposed execution of this concept is hilariously dumb and ridiculous. It also involves this little gem:

The word ""tweet"" was well on its way to the brand nirvana inhabited by Kleenex, Styrofoam, and Fridge. And he blew it all up.  

Then, when he opened up Twitter to toxic content he alienated the managers of other brands. He became enraged when well-known household brand managers decided they were unwilling to risk having their brands associated with whatever racist / sexist garbage some fool posted. And, in some cases he himself was that fool. So he vandalized both the audience side and the advertiser side of the Twitter brand. And, in trashing the advertiser side of the brand he taught the world the business value of diligent content moderation.

This biz-school case study will help students learn what makes a solid brand with good brand equity.

Lately he has brought his brand vandalism to Tesla. With his automobile-factory-executive hat on, he publicly shut down the Supercharger development operation, saying he was laying off everybody.

Tesla drivers can travel without wondering where we will get our energy, and the rest of the EV market is chaotic in this respect (at least in the US where I live).

No thanks, I'll spend my money on a company that isn't trying to use the product as a fleshlight for the CEO's ego. | Although I detest what Musk has become, I bought a Model Y for my mom a few months ago, because it was the EV that best fit her needs. It's a great car, and I would've bought a Tesla, too, if they'd had something smaller than the Y. When I was traveling in Europe recently, I noticed there were many EVs but few Teslas; a big part of this is that the Y and 3 are full-size cars in Europe, where the median car is much smaller.

It boggles my mind is that Musk has spent his energy on Twitter, Cybertruck, Robotaxi, and his politics (if you can call it that) rather than doing the most obvious thing that Tesla needs: add a smaller, more affordable model, probably a crossover around $35K. Especially if it qualified for the federal credit, it would sell like hotcakes. They were able to sell the 3 for close to that years ago (and my mom's 260-mile-range Model Y for $43K) so this would not be a giant leap for Tesla.

"Ford Mustang Mach-E Sales Soar After Discounts, Proving Cheap EVs Are the Way Forward",,692,258,1712034487,"All those words and not a single number on how many Mach-E was actually sold. 

Journalism these days. | Perhaps the Mache was just over priced? | I think the road to majority EV new vehicle market share is to have vehicles purchase prices be similar or lower than that of their closest ICE counterparts, and I think this in some part points to that.

Norway reached majority EV market share in 2019 when EVs had on average less range and lower charging speeds than those sold today and far worse than the ICE equivalents at the time and it did so via incentives bring purchase prices to or below their closest ICE counterparts.

China's going rapidly towards majority because their EV automakers brought down EV costs while their government continues to incentivize their purchase and so EVs are at similar or lower prices than their closest ICE counterparts despite many of these vehicles not having particularly great range or charging speeds.

I think some of these automakers need to simply focus on getting lower prices in the US, via production costs and/or qualifying for incentives, over getting better top line specs or new features.

A 200 mile range 100 kW max charge rate crossover about the size of a RAV4 has unimpressive top line EV specs for the category, but it'll do fine if its base purchase price is effectively less than that of the base RAV4. | Proving cheap [your_item_here] will attract sales. Mind. Blown. ðŸ¤¯ | #SHOCKING | Soâ€¦ how many were actually sold? What a dumb article. | We test drove the Mach-E which came out cheaper than the Model Y if you consider loan interest.

Unfortunately, the dealership experience was so terrible, we were put off by it. We already got our PHEV serviced from the same dealership.

We went in fully knowing Ford's ""0%"" APR plan and what the price of the vehicle should turn out in the end. We asked about it the moment we walked in. But they came to us with a very high price. As soon as we asked them about the offers, the guy made us wait 10 minutes while he ""spoke"" to his manager, came back to us with what we thought the price should be. 

The last time we bought a new car, our Ford Escape PHEV, the dealer mentioned a markup over the phone before we drove to them. We were lucky enough to negotiate the markup down to a mere $1000 at the dealership. This was during peak COVID. 

I prefer brutal honesty over these mind games dealerships like to play.

These guys wouldn't even tell me what the range of the car was.

Me: ""What's the range on this thing?"" 
Salesman: ""you mean the mpge? It's 110 mpg. Isn't that fantastic. So cheap to run""
Me: ""I mean how far will it go on a 100% charge""
Salesman: ""look at this big screen with this big dial. Isn't it amazing what these new cars have?""

Sigh. 

We went with the Model Y despite us knowing it'll cost us an additional $1,000 considering interest on payments. 

The Mach E is a nice car ruined by a typical dealership experience. 

I think manufacturers need to think hard and long about dealerships, and their exploitative practices. | I bought one this weekend. The sticker in the glove box stated original MSRP of $63,000. My cost? $46,000, with 0% ARP financing.

I traded in an Ioniq 5 (nice tech, horrible interior, and the ICCU left me carless for a month when it blew out) and don't regret it.

I'm not a Ford fan, but the deal was too good to pass up, as it dropped my monthly car payment by over $100. The Mach-E isn't as efficient, but it's more comfortable and has a better ride, IMO. | Dang, I didn't know they were doing 0 for 72 + 3000 cashback.

Biden's EV Battery Boom Is Coming â€” Whether Trump Wants It Or Not,,698,159,1734422434,"When people question the trajectory that electric vehicles are on I just point them to the percentage of new vehicles sold that are plug in.

That isn't strictly BEV as it includes PHEV but the numbers speak for themselves.

The future is electric. | If it does. Trump will take credit for it | I know. Let's call it Trump's battery boom. | Please.   A few calls from Oil and Natural Gas CEOs and handpicked EPA?  They can be such down. | [archive](https://archive.is/20241216171141/https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2024/12/16/bidens-ev-battery-boom-is-coming/) | Calling it Biden's EV Battery Boom is far too US centric and restricting the boom to EVs is small minded.

That EVs will take over the industry is obvious: EVs are both superior to and less expensive than ICE vehicles. Better and cheaper win.

Batteries will also smooth out wind and solar electricity generation. Instead of curtailing wind and solar the surplus goes into battery storage to supply the evening and early morning peaks. Since neither wind nor solar take weekends off that excess generation can be used to keep up with weekday demand. That means no more wholesale power prices dropping to negative territory. It also means no more expensive peaker plants followed by no more coal and then no more NG generation.

The future is happening no matter what politicians may or may not want. Pretty much the point Canute was trying to make with the tide. | Why would Trump not want a battery boom? Not forcing EVs and stupid energy policies is not the same as letting the market go where it's going to go.

Tariffs on China aren't the way to win the EV arms race getting serious on EVs is,,685,319,1715540031,"As long as China is able to bring quality products to the American marketplace at dirt cheap China prices, there is no way that the American manufacturers will be able to compete because at the end of the day consumers shop with their wallet and look at price tags. | I'm... not going to hold back here: This goes beyond the usual Electrek dreck â€”this is barely-coherent drivel fantasy nonsense from Jameson Dow.

""Getting serious on EVs"" is not going to make up for differences in labour rights. ""Getting serious on EVs"" is not going to make up for differences in consumer protections. It isn't going to make up for differences in overall [product quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXD_at06j3s), and it isn't going to make up for differences in logistics costs, sales costs, power generation cost ([and emissions outputs](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/013124-coal-still-accounted-for-nearly-60-of-chinas-electricity-supply-in-2023-cec)), and support costs.

It isn't going to make up for dissimilar costs against a country with an established strategy of elevating subsidies on exports, or with looser restrictions on where those exports go, or where/how precursor components are imported. *You need tariffs for those things.*

What Dow is advocating here by saying the US should just ""try harder"", once you get down to brass tacks, is nothing less than the US abdicating *itself* and magically becoming China. It's handwavey bullshit, and it fundamentally fails to recognize that countries aren't identical eggs sitting next to each other in a carton â€”you can't just say ""oh, well fry them the same way"".

China didn't just make EVs happen by ""trying harder"" â€”China did it by *being China*.

One more thing, because Dow *repeats it himself* while rallying against tariffs: 

>*perhaps least important but still worth mention, \[tariffs violate\] the oft-repeated-but-never-honestly-held principle that government should avoid picking winners and losers.*

I don't know why American and now EU market is so into making compensator big SUV's | Big oil likes it that way. | **There are 2 related topics here:  1) Tariffs & protectionisms and 2) Getting Serious about EVs & adoptions**  
  
**on Tariffs:**  

\* On one hand, it's needed if CCP is in fact heavily subsidizing it's EV industry and hence we need some tariffs to level that.     
  
\* But sometimes, the US big 3 automakers are just terrible, greedy & short sighted.  That was why we had to rescue 2 of them back in 2008.   That was when for years, they ignore the Japanese autos which makes good quality and fuel efficient cars while all they did was lobby to continue to relax EPA standards/fines.   So, when the gas prices rose sharply and all of a sudden many were abandoning gas guzzlers (i.e Hummer that gets 9 miles to the gallon) and opted for more fuel efficient cars (i.e. Corolla or Prius etc.), the US auto makers had to be rescued.  **And for years (and prob. even now) - everyone knows the US autos quality sucks compared to others.**    


\* So this time around, if the US auto/unions try and hide behind tariffs again and doesn't put out good design & quality EVs, they won't be able to compete with cars coming soon from Mexico and outside US.     
  
**On Getting Serious about EVs:**  
\* It's a fact that US is THE Slowest adoption country globally (\~10-12%?).  A lot had to do with continual misinformation's put out by conservatives who hates any changes,   dealers/truckers or oil industry & related fearing job losses.   

\* Some of the same misinformation's are:  1) EVs still refuel using coal/oil driven utilities  2) EVs catch on fires a lot  3) EV batteries (mining - energy intensive or some country uses child labors etc.)  4) EV batteries will all go to landfills - and not knowing they can be recycled to reclaim 95% of raw materials  5) EV charging is every slow compared to 5min ICE gas pumps  


\* On these misinformation's -  The government / US Autos should put together a good education campaign to educate the public on EV benefits and dispel these misinformation's .  That is what's really needed for a much longer term EV adoptions in US.   And of course, the IRA incentives need to continue.

But overall, EVs are here to stay, they may slow it down some, but in the long run, since it's a more efficient design and better for the environment overall, US adoption will continue to grow - even if it's at a much slower pace compared to other countries. | The parallel to the Japanese auto manufacturer's in 1980 is a good analogy. American car makers at the time were making boats with a side line of economy lines that were grossly underpowered and laboring under crappy pollution control attempts. Honda showed up with the CVCC engine and kicked their butts. They along with Toyota and Datsun showed up with small, efficient, and very reliable cars that fit the average commuter's needs to a tee. They got twice the gas mileage of their American counterparts and were more fun to drive. It took almost 2 decades of this ass-whipping for American car mfgs. to come around and then it was only begrudgingly. Instead they pushed new, bigger concepts of the mini-vans, and SUVs along with increasing sales of big trucks. These higher profit models bought the industry more time but the clock was ticking. Soon the Koreans entered the salesroom and Japan started importing better versions of these newly popular products.

The reason BYD and Zeeker are threatening is that they are making nicer quality, more affordable, and more practically-sized vehicles, again for the average commuter and suburban 2 child family. They have fully featured products ready to sell while the big 3 dangle concepts of which only the top end versions are equivalently equipped and then, most of them are not affordable. Tesla has been able to insert itself into this space, but their cars have a lot of shortcomings that make them less practical or desirable. The US market is ripe for disruption and the Chinese know it. Their cars may be lower priced, but most are not cheaply made. They often have better quality components, finish, and features than available in the current US and European markets.

"China Is Done With Global Carmakers: ""Thanks For Coming""","By Michael Dunne LLC (not me). 

China Is Done With Global Automakers: ""Thanks For Coming"" 

The visiting team is still on the field, running around as fast as it can, trying to forge a comeback. For decades, they thought they were playing on a familiar field. But time is up, the game is over. 

China- the home team  is the winner. Spectators have just watched a sudden and catastrophic collapse of global automakers in China. How did it happen? â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ For most of this century, foreign brands totally dominated China's car market. 

Every year, they sold millions of cars and earned billions in profits. Chinese consumers swarmed into Buick, Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota showrooms nationwide, happy to pay cash for the prestige of owning a brand that wasn't Chinese. 

China is our forever profit machine, my colleagues at GM liked to humble-brag a decade ago, back when I ran GM's Indonesia operations. We can bank on an easy $2 billion dividend every year. Now, suddenly, that golden era is over. Sales and profits in the People's Republic are vanishing. And boards in Detroit, Wolfsburg and Tokyo are stunned by the speed and intensity of the changes. 

Panic in Detroit-And Everywhere Else - Ford has lost more than $5 billion in China since 2020. Sales are down 70% from their peak. We've never seen competition like this before, says CEO Jim Farley. 

GM is hurting, too. The former poster child for sunny US-China relations, GM has lost more than $200 million so far this year alone. That marks the first time in two decades that GM's China operations have printed red ink. Mary Barra says the situation in China is unsustainable. Stellantis already knows the bitter taste of capitulation. Jeep was forced to beat an ignominious retreat from the China market in 2023 after its joint venture went bankrupt. 

Detroit is not alone. Almost every non-Chinese brand  German, Korean, Japanese and French  is feeling shell-shocked as they watch their market shares disappear.Electric Take-Off Driving China's ascendancy is a massive and abrupt shift to electric vehicles. 

The EV share of total car sales will jump to almost 50% this year, up from just 6% in 2020. Think about that. China has sprinted from 1 million to more than 10 million annual EV deliveries in just four short years. (I already see you dealership folks scratching your heads in amazement.)Global automakers were caught flat-footed on EVs, lulled into complacency by years of winning at selling gasoline-powered vehicles. 

Chinese automakers, in contrast, seized on the shift to electrics. This year, eighteen of the twenty best-selling EVs are Chinese brands. The other two are Teslas. Advanced Technology is no secret that global automakers are finding it impossible to match Chinese competitors on costs.Reached the word count limit.

I would have been surprised, but I've figured out that many large corporations are run by fucking morons who will ***NOT** learn, from history, or even books written in large point type and using simple words. Car manufacturers are some of the worst, other than the plane builders. | Lazy US automakers resting on their laurels - no big surprise. | Most cars in china were foreign but they chose to do buybacks and fund lavish pay instead of putting that money into R&D unlike the chinese counterparts. They only have themselves to blame. | The US politics aren't helping either, one side is bought and paid for by big oil and they have half the population believes green energy and transportation all liberal BS. Meanwhile, China continues to develop new tech and is outpacing the US in conversion to renewable energy, becoming the leaders in this space. | I feel like it's been said many times, but just because they convinced North American and European buyers that EV's are ""woke"" doesn't mean Asians would feel the same. It's a repeat of the oil crisis with the US refusing to make smaller cars until the Europeans and Japanese started taking their sales.

The issue here is that, for GM at least, Ultium is still a hot mess. They waited so long and they're so far behind that it will be hard for them to ever catch up. I do think BMW will always have a place in China because of the status they associate with the brand, but Buick is just too far behind. | Stunningly, if you make EV's people want and can afford they will buy them!

Truly groundbreaking thinking from the Chinese here.

(Edit: grammar) | The title should be: China is done with ICE. And since Chinese EVs are better value for money than EU/US EVs, they buy Chinese. Except Tesla but that's mainly marketing power, not better value - I wonder how long that will last. | This was like 15 years in the making, not sudden at all. The ICE car companies just chose to ignore it | This is funny as hell. A decade ago when EV sales were less than 500K per year for the whole planet and most attention was paid to the energy transition we took a good look at EVs.

The consensus view was that EVs were due to take over the industry. The fringe view was that ICE would rule forever. The fence sitters insisted that the future was mixed ICE and EV.

The economics implied that since EVs are simpler machines and battery costs were falling by 20% per year with no end in sight, then EV prices would fall to parity with ICE and continue declining until ICE no longer existed.

That was the What part of the discussion. Then we considered the When. That part is fairly simple: every once in a while you look up the typical doubling time and current EV volume and out pops a magic date. For example the current EV volume was 13.7 million plugins last year, divide by 2 and we get 6.8, divide again and we 3.4, again and get 1.7, then 1.8, then 0.9 and finally 0.45 million plugins or roughly what was sold in 2014, 10 years ago.  We divided by 2 six times and since 10 years is 120 then each of those 6 doublings took 20 months. 

We take last years sales of 13.7 million units and note that the next doubling is 27.4 million units, then 54.8, then 105.6 million units in 3 doublings or 60 months AKA 5 years and 2023+5 is 2028 when we expect EVs to have displaced 100% of ICE new vehicle sales.

The nice bit of doing this bit of arithmetic is that it is 100% certified BS free.  Of course it isn't guaranteed to be correct but it is the most objectively arrived at conclusion.

We missed quite a few wrinkles back then like the US imposing 100% tariffs on China EVs which wasn't on anyone's radar back then. We didn't count on China developing such great in car tech that western offerings are starting to look badly out of date. Apologist for the legacy automotive industry assured us that no matter how slowly the big guys were moving they could wipe out uppity EV makers with their manufacturing size and prowess...yeah.

Personally I laughed when VW couldn't figure out radio, a century old technology, when it stumbled on its early OTA attempts.

Now China's build quality is world class, its in car tech is best in class. China EV companies have better ADAS than Tesla's FSD.

Tesla is being investigated after its FSD software was involved in a fatal crash,,675,380,1729254745,"From NHTSA

The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has identified four Standing General Order
(SGO) reports in which a Tesla vehicle experienced a crash after entering an area of reduced
roadway visibility conditions with FSD -Beta or FSD -Supervised (collectively, FSD) engaged. In
these crashes, the reduced roadway visibility arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or
airborne dust. In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional
crash in these conditions involved a reported injury. The four SGO crash reports are listed at the
end of this summary by SGO number.

ODI has opened a Preliminary Evaluation of FSD (a system labeled by Tesla as a partial driving automation system),which is optionally
available in the Model Year (MY) 2016-2024 Models S and X, 2017-2024 Model 3, 2020-2024
Model Y, and 2023-2024 Cybertruck. This Preliminary Evaluation is opened to assess: 

- The ability of FSD's engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately
to reduced roadway visibility conditions; 
- Whether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for  those crashes; and 
- Any updates or modifcations from Tesla to the FSD system that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose, and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla's assessment of their safety impact.


SGO Report numbers: 13781-8004, 13781-7181, 13781-7381, 13781-7767. To review the SGO Reports prompting this investigation,
go to NHTSA.gov | The article is pretty vague on whether it was actually FSD. It talks about FSD equipped Tesla's which is every Tesla purchased in the last 5ish years - not all of them have the software tho. It also later starts talking about Autopilot accidents, which is very different to FSD. | >In each crash, they entered an area with reduced roadway visibility conditions, such as fog or airborne dust, the NHTSA said.


The camera-only system is performing well, it seems. | I don't see how it's Tesla's fault when idiots are misusing the technology and causing accidents themselves. We don't investigate beer companies when someone drinks to much and does something stupid. Like the idiot caught on video with the FSD on the highway with sun shades over the windshield and newspaper taped over the windows, stupidity is on the stupid person not the company. | The story is light on details, most of which are the same rehashed articles from 2 years ago.

There's someone who posts on r/BMW who has an i7. He used to have a Rolls Royce Ghost and one of the reasons he switched to EV was that someone once pulled a gun on him at a gas station. The Rolls Royce and the perceived income difference had a lot to do with it (can't remember if it was an attempted car-jacking), but the point is he switched to EV so he wouldn't have to endure that again. He said he's done with Rolls Royce until they release an electric sedan.


EDIT: a number of people have brought up the Rolls Royce Spectre. That's a 2+2 coupÃ© (2 door). Rolls Royce are not planning an electric sedan for another 2-3 years. The rumor is that it will be a new model and not replace the Ghost or the Phantom, which will both be retired at the end of the decade when Rolls Royce transitions to fully electric. | It is a nice time savings but it leaves me wondering where I'll buy my boner pills. | I met a guy at a Super Charger one time who quit smoking unintentionally. 

His usual routine was to fill up and head in and buy his cigarettes. When he quit going to gas stations he stopped smoking without really setting out to do so.  

I've cut out sweets the same way. | I had this conversation with someone recently who was really digging for a ""gotcha"" with EV's. I was espousing the benefits of EV's and he thought he'd be smart by saying ""Yeah? How much time do you spend charging your EV?"" He called bullshit when I replied ""none"" and then I had to explain to him that I spend no more time charging my EV than charging my cellphone. I get into my garage, I plug it into my EVSE and then go walk my dog, make dinner, whatever and I don't think about it or spend any more time than that.

Even though unplugging it in the morning isn't ""seamless"" (I have to hit the button and wait for release) it realistically takes less time than cranking the engine; I literally get in my car, buckle up and put it in gear to reverse out of my garage. Don't need to press or turn anything else.

He then started going into ""road trips"" and I asked him how many times in the last 6 months has he legitimately and honestly driven more than 200 miles in a day. He couldn't answer that one either because people don't take near as many road trips as they think they do. 

And here's the thing; I did take a road trip relatively recently \~450 miles or so each way for a couple of days. The public charging was a complete nonissue for me. My charging stops coincided nicely with the times I wanted to stop, get out of my car and walk and/or eat anyway. I never felt that my charging stops were onerous or that I was pressured into a stop. Each time I just plugged in and went and did something else so technically even then I didn't ""spend time charging""

If I'm being completely candid, I have in my 3 years of ownership had a handful of instances where I've sat in my car during late night/early morning charging stops sometimes in subzero temperatures... but even then it wasn't an imposition because I was in a comfy heated seat in a warm cabin with YouTube on my phone and I wasn't standing outside in the howling wind holding a pump handle to the side of my car. | That might be correct in your scenario but try the public chargers and you will find a lot in common with gas stations. | I felt this way until the state put in a free DC EV charging bank on my way to work.

In case you missed it: Britain finally passed a law banning the sale of non-EVs after 2035 (and more),,664,261,1721600935,"The former conservative government, initially under then Prime minister Boris Johnson, announced a ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles from 2030. This was later changed to 2035. However I wasn't able to find any actual law, it just seemed to be something they'd announced but people were taking it as a done deal.

That is until today, when I came across this article announcing the law had been passed in January with, it seems, little attention. I didn't hear a thing about it despite it being a topic I'm interested in. The article even revealed something that previous coverage missed, it wasn't that manufacturers could sell what they wanted in 2034 as long as they only sold EVs after 2035, the law actually has a gradually increasing minimum percentage of EV sales for each manufacturer and every manufacturer gets fined Â£15k (the price of a Dacia Spring EV) for every vehicle sold over the limit.

This seems like a much stronger stance that I'd previously understood, stronger than I'd even hoped for. This year, the first year, 22% of cars sold must be EVs. Given that last year it was around 16% that could mean a lot of pressure to increase the sales toward the end of the year. This year alone 3 of the 4 cheapest announced EVs will be on sale.

One possible loophole is that companies can trade credits, so Tesla could trade 78% of it's credits and still be compliant this year. Essentially that would mean that the average would have to be above the target but even that'll be costly for some companies, and lucrative for others. I imagine that Tesla could potentially lower their prices in order to increase sales in order to sell credits for more than they lowered the prices by.

The article mentions that this year companies can use up to 75% of banked credits, I take that to mean that Ferrari, say, could meet 16.5% of the target through credit trading alone and would have to make up the other 5.5% through sales or more likely paying a fine equivalent to Â£15k on 5.5% of the number of cars sold this year. After this year only 25% of the target can be used with banked credits and companies can rollover unused credits to future years

> Any car makers that aren't able to meet these quotas could face a fine of Â£15,000 per car sold that isn't compliant.

Some people would pay 15k extra for a petrol car because the car company isn't going to eat the 15k.  It will be passed onto the buyer as an added ""petrol fee"" lol | >If car makers exceed their EV annual sales targets, they can bank allowances for use in future years or trade them with other firms that have fallen short. In 2024, manufacturers can borrow up to 75% of their annual target. This will then drop to 25% in 2026, with the idea being to help firms with low EV volumes in the early stages of the scheme.

Tesla gonna make bank on this. | Fun stuff! The law was apparently passed back in January and the new PM is going to reinstate the 2030 target.  Should the conservative win the next election they will change it once again.

By 2030 the automotive transition will already be a done deal if current lease deals are any indication. For instance a VW ID4 is available for lease for a net $233/mth, that's $178 for the lease with the $2K due at signing averaged out over the lease period. It comes with 12,000 ""free"" miles per year.

The average used car load loan is $523/mth. So drive new for less than half the price?

My interpretation is that cheap EV leases are the first step in falling EV prices which like the PC, flat screen TV, and digital cameras all started life as very expensive toys before becoming extremely affordable must haves.

Interesting times. | Fun fact, the new labour government who were recently elected put it in their manifesto to reinstate the 2030 ban.

"EV buyers want SUVs and sedans, not minivans or trucks, survey says",,671,515,1711738414,"Uh, I'd love to get a minivan EV. | I want a big wagon with a comfy interior.  That's why I still drive an older Model S.  Sedan roof line is efficient, but it's got enough cargo space for five people and two dogs, or 4 people and 4 sets of hockey gear or golf clubs.

My 2017 with the full premium interior still feels ""nicer"" than any of the refreshed Model S and it's a great size.

Jacking up the suspension and raising the roof height literally does nothing good except reduce range significantly. | I think one of the important things for the success of EVs is accepting the importance of sedans or estates. If you want efficient, very long distance vehicles, with real world highway ranges of 300, 350 miles and above,  or vehicles with good ranges but small batteries, low construction costs and low weight, they almost need to be sedans because of air resistance, sedans are the only vehicle shape with a low frontal area and an efficient, sweeping shape. If you want to get long highway ranges out of inefficient vehicle shapes you need larger batteries which increase weight and reduce efficiency even further.

In the long run battery cost, charge speed or battery density might be so high that efficiency doesn't matter, but one of the reasons why Tesla maintains a lead is they are the only company in Europe or America to mass produce an EV sedan for a mass market price. Every other company thinks the sedan is a dying class of vehicle, because the overwhelming inefficiency of  the ICE drivetrain makes the aerodynamic efficiency of sedans unimportant.

Maybe there should be different, more EV relevant branding for that class of vehicle to make clear the benefit that aerodynamic efficiency has, so rather than a sedan call it an EV cruiser or an EV tourer or something like that which carries the additional meaning of long, easy trips, not just the shape of the car.

If you're driving the distance, don't just buy any sedan, buy an electric cruiser. | I presume this is an US survey? It doesn't say.

I have some comments, some of them are an outsider's perspective (Norwegian).

1. Methodology. This seems to be a short summary only, and doesn't show the exact questions asked, demographics (what part of the country, rural people, city people, age, income bracket and so on). That would make it more useful.
2. I would love to see the same study done in various countries around the world with different EV penetration figures. I'm sure the results would vary significantly, and would also give some hints on how perceptions change from a country with low EV sales compared to ICE to high EV sales.
3. Again assuming this is a US survey, my perception (please correct me if I'm wrong) is that a lot of people see an EV as a car number two, for doing errands locally, picking up kids and so on and not as their main one for long distance driving, which many people only see as something an ICE car is suitable for. This would severely impact the wanted range if true, and also the price bracket. That would be nice to know.

My outside perspective: Being Norwegian, where now over 90 % of new cars sold are EV's, we see our EV as our main car, and want it to have a good range, but not a massive range. If I can drive for 4 hours without charging, I'll need a break anyway, so a 30 minute stop to charge, pee and get a bite is entirely OK. Most people here also wants SUV's, no doubt, and Tesla would also be the highest on the list, but you would see VW group (VW, Audi, Skoda, Porsche), KIA, Huyndai and Volvo.

Please tell me if I'm mistaken, I think this is a very interesting topic. | Please take me to this survey so I can correct the misconception that I don't want a minivan. I desperately want an EV minivan. | >The survey shows that car buyers looking for EVs are, on the whole, not well-informed. Twelve percent said they trust Toyota best when it comes to EVs, despite the fact that the Japanese automaker is years behind its rivals and has but a single, somewhat mediocre EV on sale today in 2024. Another 8 percent named Honda, which similarly is lagging the industry in terms of electrification.

>Tesla scored top (23 percent), followed by BMW (13 percent)â€”both companies with extensive experience in electrifying automobiles. Ford and Chevrolet shared fifth place (7 percent), but neither Kia nor Hyundai were namechecked, despite offering a range of EVs, most of which are best in class.

>Edmunds also found a pretty wide spread when it asked car buyers how much range they needed. Just fewer than 1 in 4 (24 percent) said they'd be happy with 99 miles (160 km) or less. Another 22 percent said between 100199 miles (160320 km) was fine, with 17 percent indicating that 200299 miles (320481 km) was the sweet spot. Most EVs on sale today fall into this range bracket.

>But a significant number of potential EV buyers indicated a desire for much more range. Nineteen percent wanted 300399 miles (482642 km)â€”the Hyundai Ioniq 6, Tesla Model 3, Mercedes-Benz EQS, BMW i4 and i7, and the Polestar 2 all fit this bill. | I want hatchbacks GDI | I want hatchbacks | Not massive trucks. | I want a hatchback.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit
Is this the end of EV incentives in the US?,"Do tonight's results mean the end of the IRA?
",659,1066,1730879192,"It feels like a devastating blow to the US EV market, especially if the house is Republican. The IRA will most likely be gone and charging infrastructure will suffer. | I don't know man, it's the end of a lot of things, the 8k incentives on EVs is the least of my problems right now. | I'd buy before the end of the year. | Short story: yes. | Trump likes to talk tough and has easily misled followers, so he doesn't have to end incentives for EVs, he just has to say he did, or say he ""fixed"" them.

I suspect what will happen is Trump will announce on day 1 he's ended the Biden EV mandate to ban gas cars (which will be very easy to do because no such mandate ever existed, of course) and sign some blank piece of paper with his giant sharpie for a photo op.

As to the incentives, the consumer incentives might be in peril- the lease loophole will likely close (which frankly wouldn't be the worst thing) and maybe the Republican-controlled Senate will push through a law ending the new and used EV consumer incentives, but I don't really think they'll bother.

But even if they do, I suspect the charger and battery factory incentives will continue. Like the old joke says, what's the difference between a subsidy and a handout: if *I* get it, it's a subsidy, if *you* get it, it's a handout. Republicans love free government money when they get it. Factory and charging infrastructure subsidies are going to big businesses, not hippie communes. As stupid as Trump is, someone in his administration is hopefully smart enough to realize that having an adversary like China completely owning the EV and battery markets is not a good thing for the USA.

With Musk on his side, Trump will lighten his stance on EVs, and take credit for any increased adoption by ""good American EVs"" creating jobs instead of those ""Biden Chinese EVs"" that were going to destroy the country. (Yes, I know there are no ""Biden Chinese EVs"", but facts don't matter anymore.) Then, many of the thousands of chargers funded by the first NEVI round in 2023 will likely be coming on line in early to mid 2025 (as planned) and Trump will take credit for those, saying Biden only built 8 (or whatever Trump's BS numbers were) chargers during his entire term and Trump has presided over thousands being built in his first year in office. 

Many European countries have reduced or eliminated their consumer subsidies and tax credits and EV adoption is still increasing there. 

This is definitely a bump in the road, but it won't be the end of EVs | Yes, but it's also kind of time.

This has been true for several years now. | Alot of YouTube videos I watched tried to tell me how difficult phevs were since you had to plug them in every time you got home.

That's so much bullshit. It's the best car I have ever owned. I absolutely love it. | From 2018-2023, Mercedes achieved the largest reduction in CO2 emissions at 73 g/mile, VW came in second with 44 g per mile and BMW was third with 34 g per mile.

Not a surprise, but still disappointing. | Not surprised at all.  There are three big factors at play here, and both a related to letting the SuperCharger team go earlier this year:

* The lines of communication with Volvo, GM, Polestar and the other automakers were disrupted.  To make SuperCharger compatibility work, there's a lot of information that has to flow between Tesla and the automakers, and it takes time, communication, and the correct technical staff to set up these flows.
* Station capacity needs to be expanded to support the influx of vehicles.that need a charge.  This takes time, leases, and construction contracts -- all of which were disrupted by the layoffs.
* Related to the above, slow roll-out of the v4 SuperChargers.  These are the first ones that support 800V architectures and 350kW charging (the v3 SuperChargers support 400V architectures and up to 250kW charging).  This means that Tesla chargers are going to be slow not only for the CyberTruck (Tesla's first 800V vehicle) but also for 800V products from GM, Genesis, Kia, Hyundai, and Lucid. | Elon is fucking up Tesla while simultaneously demanding $56 billion.

Now Musk has made the whole adoption rollout questionable, which also raises the question of whether he might rescind compatibility with brands if/when he gets upset about something or other at any random time.  He's not reliable - unlike the Tesla charging network.

For me, CCS chargers have been easy to find when I am on a trip - otherwise I charge each evening at home, so no worries on being out local for hours on any given day. | Tesla made the great decision to fire everyone responsible for the network. 

But more importantly, other brands have advanced their battery tech past what Tesla and their superchargers are compatible with. A lot of brands are already at or past 800v and 350kw+ battery tech. Tesla is still stuck at 400v 250kw (if you're lucky)

Tesla recalls 1.8 million cars because their hoods can open while driving,"The electric car manufacturer Tesla had to issue a massive recall this month to fix faulty hood latches that can open while its cars are driving. The problem affects more than 1.8 million cars, which means it's slightly smaller than the recall in December that applied to more than 2 million Teslas.

The problem, according to the official National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Part 573 safety recall report, affects model year 20212024 Model 3s (built between September 21, 2020, and June 2, 2024), model year 20212024 Model Ss (built between January 26, 2021, and July 15, 2024), model year 20212024 Model Xs (built between August 18, 2021, and July 15, 2024), and model year 20202024 Model Ys (built between January 9, 2020, and July 15, 2024).

...

Although the problem is with the hood latch, as with many Tesla safety recalls, the problem can be fixed with an over-the-air software patch. The new software is able to detect if the hood is open and, if so, will display a warning to the driver to alert them to stop their vehicle and secure the hood.",642,244,1722352167,"There is no physical defect in the latch that would cause it to open while driving, there's a bug in the software that detects whether the frunk is closed in the first place.

So technically the recall isn't because the ""hoods can open while driving,"" it's because you can drive with the hood open and not receive a warning. | Lol I was reading this and thinking ""oh wow, an actual physical recall from Tesla this time"", then I got to the last paragraph and it's just another OTA update like every other Tesla recall...

I know it's legally considered a ""recall"" but there's a reason they don't say ""Tesla issues patch"" or ""Tesla sends out over the air fix"" in the headlines. | NO, the frunk could never open on its own while driving.  The title is wrong. 

Once again this is misleading, overblown, and likely was ""fixed"" long before the article with an OTA software push.

There is NO defect where the frunk can magically open while driving.  There was a SW bug for detecting if the driver left the frunk open and then started to drive.

EVERY car I've ever owned let me drive with the hood open.  (I've had to move cars closer with the hood open to jump another car, etc. ).  So anyone complaining that the car can be driven that way doesn't know what they are talking about.   A faulty sensor could then disable a car. | Headlines call it a recall, then it turns out to be a software update fixable thing.  Why is this even news. It will be gone overnight. | This is another ""recall"" bait headline. Nothing hardware is faulty. There's a software bug and will be patched in a simple software update. That's the story. | I think we should reserve recall for things that need physical fixes. | The issue was corrected as part of the 2024.20.3 update released in mid-June.

Elon Musk signals reaching limit of Tesla's HW3 despite self-driving promise,,640,456,1722010227,"I'm shocked | It is always just around the corner! | I remember when it was promised that **Hardware 2** would support level 5 FSD.

Also as well, if HW3 can't run full FSD (let's say level 4 or 5), then how can those cars be used as part of the robotaxi fleet without an upgrade? Hardware 4 has only be available for ~18 months, meaning a lot of the fleet might not be able to run the full FSD. And only Model S and X have the forward radar and bumper cameras. Will there really be different levels of robotaxi capability based on model, model year, and hardware? | Meh, IMO you buy a care for the features it currently offers. If you are buying a car based on promised future upgrades you will always be upset because companies in general never deliver. Musk should just focus on keeping his mouth shut and get his companies figured out | As someone who actually works with AI/ML (modelling, implementing, training, and then deploying for inference) I've been saying that Tesla will never get to level 5 on currently shipping hardware for years (specifically in reference to HW3). The hardware simply lacks of the performance necessary to do the job with a unified neural model.

Furthermore the overall sensor suite on shipping cars is probably insufficient, even with upgraded hardware (HW4 for example). 

When FSD 12 first released, I suggested we were likely already seeing the relative high of what the current hardware could provide. Some things could get optimized and improved for sure, but nobody should expect generational improvements from future FSD releases. The raw limit of computing power onboard didn't suggest anything else.

But that sure didn't stop people from loudly explaining why i was completely wrong. One person went so far as to claim that Tesla was already level 4. He followed that up with a claim that he wrote the SAE definitions himself (he didn't) as some kind of reality disconnected check mate. 

That was about when I stopped talking about how much of a grift Tesla FSD is on Reddit. There is a Tesla fan base that is so obsessed and so dedicated that they have unhinged from reality itself at this point. | The grift continues. | It's Almost like musk is perpetually full of sh*t | In 2-5 years he'll say that the current sensor suite isn't enough to provide safe autonomous driving. | Concerning | Sounds like the FSD model now has too many parameters to fit natively on HW3, which means the ""optimizing"" Elon mentioned is likely to be some form of quantization (perhaps from FP16 to FP8) to get it to fit/run on HW3. 

If I'm right then the reduced resolution means there's a good chance that HW3 cars will be slightly worse drivers than HW4 cars and, as the model gets larger and the quantization uses fewer bits, HW3 FSD will get worse and the disparity between FSD on H3 vs HW4 will widen.

We also didn't take the shortest route, since we decided to visit some national parks in Utah and Colorado, as well as my wife's alma mater, UIUC.

We almost entirely used Electrify America, except for three occasions on Tesla destination chargers and three on L2 ChargePoints. My car actually cannot use NACS-enabled Superchargers yet, and originally I thought I would have to use some Magic Dock Superchargers but that turned out not to be the case. I used Electrify America a total of 24 times according to the app (more in reality due to some EA chargers in free mode). None of my EA charging sessions exceeded 30 minutes. Most were about 1215 minutes long. 

Here's the complete 14-day itinerary including charging stops.

* Day 1: I charged the car to 100% overnight at home. Due to the need to run some errands in the morning, when we started the road trip there was 90% left. The onboard navigation predicted that we would arrive at Harris Ranch EA at 17%, but due to significant traffic congestion we arrived at 35%. EA performed well, giving me 244kW max. Ordered burgers at the restaurant but unfortunately the car reached 80% before the burger was ready. Unplugged as soon as the burger was ready, at 91%. Then drove to an Airbnb in Bakersfield with Tesla destination charger. Charged to 100% overnight. 

* Day 2: We drove from Bakersfield to Baker and arrived at 25% SOC. That Electrify America was glorious with very needed canopy. 12 chargers in total, 3 available. Charged to 89% at 177kW maximum. Then drove to our hotel in Las Vegas, arriving with 45% left. When we drove to a restaurant for dinner, we noticed a L2 ChargePoint nearby. While we had dinner, we charged to 66%. Then we drove back to the hotel at 65%. We didn't charge at any EA in Las Vegas area due to how congested they were. Honestly the L2 ChargePoint was essential in retrospect: if we couldn't charge in Las Vegas the battery would be awfully low when we got to the next EA.

* Day 3: We left the hotel at 65% and arrived at the EA in Mesquite, NV at 25%. The 350kW chargers were occupied so we plugged into the 150kW. It gave us 173kW which was fast enough. We used the restroom in the adjoining Walmart and ordered takeout from Subway. By the time we got the subway order the car was at 92%. We then drove to yet another EA at Telegraph, UT and charged to 95%. We thought we would drive to Zion and then Bryce Canyon along U.S. 89 which has no charging, so we charged here almost to full (ABRP said charge to 100%), but we changed our plans later on and decided to visit the Kolob Canyons area. 

* Day 4: We didn't drive at all. Took the NPS shuttle to Zion and back to Springdale. 

* Day 5: We drove from the hotel to Kolob Canyon and then to the EA at Cedar City, UT. Arriving at the charger at 44% and charged to 94%. Again the limiting factor was the slow subway order at Walmart. We didn't need to charge that long because we booked a hotel with Tesla destination chargers (Best Western Plus Ruby's Inn). Fortunately no one was waiting for the EA charger. Drove to Bryce Canyon National Park along the scenic drive and then checked in to the hotel at 60%. Charged to 100% in the evening. Took the NPS shuttle back into the park: the shuttle is more convenient than driving because one could start the hike at one shuttle stop and end at another without making it a full loop. I also appreciated taking a break from driving and letting a professional bus driver do it.

* Day 6: We started from the hotel at 100%, passed through Capitol Reef National Park, drove by a couple of attractions there and ended up at the Green River EA with 41% left. Charged to 80% and left for Moab, UT. Arrived in Moab, UT and visited a lot of places in Arches National Park. Charged to 90% at the newly opened Electrify America (RMP Moab) on the way back to the hotel. This charging station actually opened just a few weeks ago. If we had started the trip a few weeks earlier, we would have to find some other way to charge.

* Day 7: Drove to Canyonlands National Park, Island in the Sky district in the morning for some hikes. Passed by the same EA and topped up from 60% to 90%, and then drove to the Needles District to see some amazing views. Drove back to the hotel. During this drive I noticed the steering wheel shaking whenever the speed was above 55mph: it's a known issue probably because of the foam in the Michelin tires. Found a nice tire shop on Yelp. The tire shop was closed for the day so decided to go to the tire shop first thing in the morning for a balance. 

* Day 8: Went to the tire shop just when they open. Unfortunately there was already a line of people with tire problems. Waited a bit and did the balance. Then charged one last time at Moab to 83% and left for Alamosa, CO. The ABRP said to take the southerly route, but that route has two ChargePoint stations each with only two plugs and charges at 125kW max. I decided to take the I-70 instead with two Electrify America stations. Arrived at the EA in Grand Junction, CO with 36%. Walked to the other side of the street for Chick-fil-A. The Chick-fil-A was crowded. By the time I got the carry out order and walked back to the car it was at 99%. Fortunately no one was waiting. Drove to another EA in Edwards, CO. This time there was a short wait and it was actually the only time I waited at all in this trip. ABRP told us to charge to 90% which we did. We then drove to Alamosa, CO. On this drive we encountered the tire imbalance issue again. Charged the car to 100% at a nearby L2 ChargePoint for the night. 

* Day 9: I realized that if I visited a Michelin-recommended tire shop, they would be defending the quality of the tires and would refuse to remove the foam in the tires. I found a tire shop that does not sell Michelin tires at all. Finally the mechanic didn't try to convince us that the foam was fine and agreed to remove it. Did a balance and then drove to Great Sand Dunes National Park. Then drove to the Electrify America in Pueblo, CO, arriving at 51% and charged to 90%. ABRP said this leg would use a lot of energy but it turned out it wanted us to drive on the toll road E-470. But I didn't want the hassle of mailed toll notices so I endured Denver traffic. ABRP said I would make it to the next Electrify America at 20% but with traffic I arrived with 48%. Charged to 85% and drove to Estes Park, CO. 

* Day 10: Visited Rocky Mountain National Park for the whole day. Drove on the highest paved road in the contiguous United States and visited the highest NPS visitor center. Left the park and drove back to the hotel with 50% left. 

* Day 11: Drove east and stopped at the Electrify America at Fort Morgan, CO. The 350kW chargers were occupied so I used the 150kW. Arrived at 25% and charged to 85%. Next charging stop was in Ogallala, NE. Arrived at 45% and charged to 95% (actually ABRP asked me to charge to 98% but I decided to ignore that). The onboard navigation said I would not get to my next charging stop in Grand Island, NE. I in fact arrived with 27% left. Tried a charger but it stuck at 90kW; switched to a different one to get 160kW. To stay within EA's free charging rules, I made sure the combined charging time for both sessions did not exceed 30 minutes. Drove to the hotel in Grand Island for the night. 

* Day 12: Left the hotel. Arrived at the Electrify America in Council Bluffs, IA at 29%. Charged to 80%. Drove to the Electrify America at Brixmor Haymarket in Des Moines at 28%. Charged to 80% again. Drove to the Electrify America in Williamsburg, IA at 44% and charged to 80%. Drove to our hotel in Davenport and plugged in to the Tesla destination charger. I guess I was lucky because out of the two destination chargers, one was broken so there was only one working and it happened not to be occupied. Had a nice conversation with the hotel front desk (""you drive a Hyundai but you want to charge with Tesla?"")

* Day 13: Left the hotel with 100% charge. Arrived at the Electrify America in Champaign, IL at 24%. Charged to 80%. Parked near campus and walked around for a bit. The parking garage had a ChargePoint L2 so plugged in. When we finished the campus visit it was at 89%. Then drove to the EA in Indianapolis and charged to 90%. Drove to EA in Columbus, OH and charged from 30% to 80%. Drove to our hotel in Columbus with 75%.

* Day 14: Drove to the EA in Mansfield, Ohio. Charged from 54% to 92%. Charged at the EA in Clarion, PA and charged from 30% to 92% again. One final charge at the EA in Bloomsburg, PA from 35% to 92%. All these chargers were uneventful.",633,175,1722786240,"I've done it twice from San Diego to Boston and then back again. All EA and no problems at any charger.

I've had problems with chargers on occasion but on the cross country trip I was fine both ways. | I agree with you. The CCS network isn't great, but we've never been stranded by it.

What ended up being the total cost and additional time with all the charging? | >ABRP is reliable and can be fully trusted.

No, ABRP cannot be ""fully trusted"". On a recent 5500 mile road trip in May, it directed me to two EA stations that had been closed for upgrades. One in Salina, KS, where I literally watched two men lift the old chargers into a truck with a crane when I arrived, and one in Cincinnati where I arrived to see 6 brand new EA chargers, still wrapped in their packing material waiting to be connected.

I'm not crapping on ABRP; it's an excellent app, but anyone planning a long EV road trip needs to understand the limitations of any of these apps. ABRP's limitations are outdated charger information and a pretty crappy route planner compared to Google.

Before that trip I mentioned above, I always verified all my ABRP-planned stops in PlugShare to get more up to date info, but on that trip I got too cocky. I'd done a dozen 1000+ mile trips before, and the first half of this one was a route I'd done before, so I was mostly hitting stations I'd used before. Even after hitting the first downed station in Kansas *I still didn't get the hint!* and still didn't bother checking PlugShare until I hit the second closed station in Cincy! | L2 are so underrated, and every hotel parking should have suffisant of them to be sure all guest to want to charge overnight can.

"The U.S. Is Now Adding 1,000 New EV Chargers Every Week",,627,136,1725047186,"1000? I want to believe. | I still maintain that we don't need a specific \*quantity\* of chargers. We need chargers in the most effective locations. 

Trying to replicate the gas station experience is half folly. Yes, we do need them in interconnected locations to make traveling distances work better, but the vast majority of chargers we need are at homes, workplaces, and places where people shop/eat. 

The biggest challenges we have are getting people access to charging in places where they don't own a house or in areas of the country where the electricity infrastructure is lacking. 

I hope that rather than focusing on quantity we're focused on effectiveness. 

I also hope that we're giving ourselves breathing room for changes in technology. | While focusing on highway fast chargers will help ease range anxiety,  the US should really focus on adding Level 2 charging near apartment complexes, shopping centers, and large job sites.

I work on Tesla's Autopilot team. I watch hours of customers' driving videos every day and am monitored constantly.,,630,153,1725892576,"That's sorta the job if you work as a data annotator on something like autopilot, no? | This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a Tesla employee who spoke anonymously to protect their privacy. Business Insider has verified their identity and employment and corroborated their claims during our reporting on Tesla's Autopilot facilities. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

My job is to help train Tesla's vehicles to drive themselves. A Tesla has 9 different cameras that collect data the Autopilot team goes through in order to teach the Full Self-Driving and Autopilot software how to drive like a human.

I spend hours everyday going over videos that were taken from customer cars and Tesla's in-house test drivers. We label every little thing â€” from making sure a car doesn't try to drive on the shoulder of the road to telling it how to react when a lane is closed due to construction or when there's a four-way stop sign.

Advertisement

Within the program there are many different little projects that are all combined to create the greater Full Self-Driving and Autopilot experience. We work on hyper-focused projects that can last for weeks or months. For example, you could spend months labeling road lines or teaching the vehicle how to respond to different weather conditions, like how to identify snow banks and operate when there's snow covering lane markings.

I've seen clips from all over the world â€” and some accidents as well

Sometimes Tesla's cameras will capture accidents that happen nearby. It can be difficult to watch, but as soon as we run across one, we flag it to a supervisor.

Related stories

When I first started at Tesla, it was common for people to share clips around the office, usually just odd things they saw. But, one worker took it too far. He shared a clip of a little boy who'd been hit by a Tesla while riding his bike. I thought that was sadistic.

Tesla cracked down on image sharing and what we could access after Reuters published a story on it. They essentially told us If you're caught once, that's your ticket out the door.

Advertisement

After that, you couldn't access images outside of your allocated team folder anymore, and Tesla put watermarks on some of the images so you could easily tell where it came from, if it was redistributed. Sometimes people still pass images around the office, especially if it's something out of the ordinary, but it doesn't happen as often.

There is something very strange about having this very intimate view into someone's life. It feels odd to see someone's daily drive, but it's also an important part of correcting and refining the program.

At the same time, we're under our own microscope

Anytime we're making key clicks on the computer, Tesla knows what we're doing. There are cameras basically everywhere we work so the only place you can really get any privacy is in the bathroom.

We review about five and a half to six hours of footage per day. It can be very hard to focus. You can get in this kind of fog when you're just watching clip after clip and it can be difficult to keep yourself sane.

Advertisement

Tesla gives us a 15-minute break and a 30-minute lunch break, but you have to time it perfectly because of Tesla's employee monitoring software: Flide Time. It tracks keystrokes and how long we're working on the images, which can make it tricky. To properly label some of the clips you have to use outside resources. So you'll have to go out of the labeling system to review traffic laws or Tesla's labeling policies, but anytime you're not clicking around in the software program, it tracks you as if you aren't working and it basically sets off an alarm to your superiors.

If you don't hit Flide Time â€” even if you were five minutes off â€” the next day, you will end up in a disciplinary meeting with a team lead and you'd get a point put against your record. You could be fired, if you get three points in the span of six months.

I've gotten in trouble for missing Flide Time. They bring you into a separate office and ask: Why didn't you make any changes to the software program for 15 minutes? You could basically get fired for spending too long in the bathroom.

There's definitely a feeling that we're just worker ants.

When we had concerns they were often brushed off. There were some times we were told to ignore No Turn on Red or No U-Turn signs. Those were the kind of things that made me and my coworkers uncomfortable. In some cases, they would hear us out, but other times the general response was along the lines of Mind your business and your pay grade.

My experience at Tesla has been different than I'd thought it would be when I started. I thought it would be a great opportunity for my career, but now I view it as this dystopian company.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. | I am a software quality architect. One of the roles I've taken on in our company is how 'metricizing' tasks can impact the work we do. If you haven't heard of ""Goodhart's Law"" (not a \*real\* law, by the way), google it, that might give a little clarity into the concept.

There is no broad answer that we can give here, but we would want to review individual scenarios and write an analysis. Two things set off bells in my mind as needing review here:

1. the incentive to continually be pressing keys on ones keyboard in order to abate getting a 'sit-down' with management

This scenario makes me wonder how often employees are entering junk keypresses because ""this one is taking too long, gotta keep moving"" or to ""get ahead on quota"" or ""because i'm going on break let me finish this real quick""

What impact would this amount of ""junk data"" (if it even is junk)  ultimately have on the finished product. Are these clips reviewed by 2 or more people in order to ""take an average""?

2. being told to ""ignore no-U-Turn signs""

Im not exactly sure what the context of this quote is, but I would presume data entry should accurately represent the real world when possible. Whether your system decides it should then ignore the real world is a different question, but I would think you'd want to begin with consistent and accurate recordings. | https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-autopilot-data-annotation-specialist-job-experience-buffalo-2024-9 | [deleted] | Teach FSD not to drive like a drunk on ramps to hwys | Don't you think adding LIDAR would make everyones job more easier. | > A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Polestar's CEO Is Out,,627,235,1724846093,"> He will be replaced by Michael Lohscheller.
> 
> Lohscheller was previously CEO at Opel, VinFast and Nikola Motor.

Oh no. | I mean, to be fair, having both Nikola and VinFast on your resume isn't exactly ""comforting"".

IMO Polestar should have just stayed a factory performance arm / sub-brand to Volvo. The brand split basically robbed Volvo of a a halo ""C90"" coupe, a Model 3-fighting ""S40 Recharge"" and a ""EC90"" in the Polestar 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Even brands that have been modestly successful in splitting off, like Volkswagen's Cupra or Renault's Alpine, either don't do enough to distance themselves from the mothership (Cupra) or stick to niche vehicles and segments (Alpine).

The Polestar 4 is cool, but what even is the point of it? They can't possibly chase Tesla-level volume with that car.

And there are plenty of historical precedents for selling the ""special branded"" cars in normal dealerships. The most recent examples of this are GMC selling the Hummer EV, Ford's expansion of the Bronco brand, and JLR's split of Discovery, Defender, and Range Rover. Volvo isn't exactly a mainstream brand, so I don't believe it would be as perilous for Volvo to sell the Polestar 5 and 6 in specialized Volvo dealerships as it was for, say, Hyundai to sell the Genesis and Equus.

The one thing that was good about Ford's ownership of Volvo back in the 2000s was that they really got to expand and have fun with the brand. The S60 and V60 Polestars were amazing. They still are. | Seeing a low performing CEO be removed and replaced with one just as arguably shitty in their stead reminds me of Starbucks' current fiasco.

I wonder if this is going to be a trend.

Either way, I wanna see more CEOs be held responsible for their incompetence. | Polestar should have tried to do what Xiomi did in china - connect the p4 heart and soul to carplay.  They could have grabbed a ton of apple fanboys especially if they were to go all in on the full CP2.0 experience.  The Xiomi marketing material around how their phone just seamlessly connects to the car and allows additional functionality looked amazing. | Geely getting rid of Thomas is sad, as Polestar loses its visionary or at the very least the guy who knows what the brand is. But on the other hand, he has to take responsibility for all the bullshit Polestar is going through right now. But losing head of design _and_ your CEO is not a good look.

The new CEO feels like a Sculley-type, who'll upend the business to be more volume selling. His tenures at Opel, VinFast and Nikola range from nothing special to dumpster fire - which I'm not sure will actually help Polestar.

Their big issue is Geely themselves. They're becoming very Stellantis-like but with none of the benefits. For example: Polestar does relatively well in Europe, but not in China. For Zeekr, its the opposite. Why isn't Zeekr stepping back in the EU and Polestar stepping back in China? Why are they fighting for the same marketshare under their own umbrella? Why isn't there more cooperation between the different brands? Polestar has a lot in common with Lotus, yet aren't allowed to freely cooperate with each other.

Funnily enough I was at Polestar HQ last week, and the speech Ingenlath gave was very shaky and almost incoherent. We joked he got a difficult call from Geely right before - but little did we know it'd actually be true.

Its sink or swim for Polestar, and I'd rather see it stay afloat. Even if all their cars are about â‚¬10k too expensive. | Here's a big brain suggestion for ya, Mikey: **find a way to get service closer than a half day drive from Chicago, the third largest metro in the USA.**

If I have to hire a car transport company to get my car to service in case of big problems, I'm not buying one. If I have to take a day off work and book a hotel just to get my car **to** service, I'm not buying one under any conditions. If I wanted to buy an EV with no support, I'd go buy a cheap Lucid!

Don't care about the spat with Volvo Illinois dealers; that's a you problem not a me problem. Resolve the dispute with the dealer network. Don't make it a full dealership, make it only a service center. Plop it right over the border in Indiana or Wisconsin. *Do something to solve the problem.*

Of all the electric brands, the one you never, ever, *never ever* ***never*** see around Chicago is Polestar. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why.

(Not interested in the ""you barely need service in an EV"" argument.) | Changing CEO won't change the fact that expensive high end cars (like Polestar are going for these days) is selling less and less. That's just how the world is atm, and will probably be for a long long time. | ""Let's build all of our vehicles in China and ship them to the US and Europe at large margins!""

""Shit...""

But I mean, at least Hertz bought a bunch of Polestar 2s.... | Polestar company's culture is deeply flawed. There's a noticeable lack of technological understanding, and what they call ""R&D"" is mostly just selecting dimensions and brackets for parts from tier 1 suppliers like brakes and suspensions. While the visual design work is handled in Sweden, the vision there is severely lacking. Max Missoni, who had the ""archistar"" vibes and even admitted that Ingenlath knew more about the technical aspects than he did, wasn't exactly a trailblazer either. His most notable change was removing the rear windowâ€”a move that hardly qualifies as innovative.

The designs are just more of the same old SUV concepts. Take the Polestar 5, for example.

Believe it or not, there's even a transmission tunnel in the carâ€”a completely ridiculous feature for an EV.

Polestar is essentially buying the ""electric architecture"" from Geely, but the communication between the two companies is almost nonexistent, leading to a significant disconnect in the development process. While the design and motors are controlled by Sweden, where political games and limited technical skills dominate, the most knowledgeable individuals are actually in the UK.

Their pricing is prohibitively expensive compared to EVs with similar equipment/spec, and they have half assed some stuff like having a centre transmission tunnel on the Polestar 2.

I've paid for charging a few times, but only when I drive a road trip (I live in Kelowna BC, driven to Calgary and Vancouver a few times) usually costs me about $18CAD for a charge. I get about 400km to a charge

I have put 3 sets of tires on them, and changed the wiper a few times. That is all the maintenance I've paid for!

The KIA has 76,000km on it the Hyundai has 172,000km on it.

I will never buy an ICE car again. I cannot see the purpose. It costs way more. The fun of an electric car is substantially more than an ICE. The cost of maintaining it is virtually zero.

Our experience owning an EV and losing power for 7 days,"Our family endured 7 days without electricity due to the 2024 summer storm in Northern Ohio.

Lots of people ask EV owners ""What will you do when the power is out?"" and I want to share our experience.

I don't top my car off every single day. I charge the car at home every two weeks when it hits 20%. When the power went out, the EV was at 40% charge. This is roughly 100 miles of range and was more than enough to cover for a few days. This storm occurred suddenly, and only lasted about 20 minutes but did unthinkable damage here in the suburbs. I personally have never seen something like this where we live. 4 or 5 confirmed touch downs for tornados.  This is not a hurricane where people are warned over and over again for days until it lands. There was no real preparation for this.

We have a 4kw gas generator. It's an older Generac 4000xl.  We have an all electric home so there is no natural gas.

We needed gas for the generator, but the gas stations didn't have power. Ironically, nobody is getting any gas. Once the gas stations had power, residents cleaned them out. The lines for the gas station were so long, police had to direct traffic. People were panic buying and causing a domino effect. The three gas stations closest to us were now out of gas.

We had to drive to another city to fill our gas cans.

On the third day of our ordeal, the EV was down to 25%. I was running our fridge, our freezer, three aquariums, the TV and the neighbors fridge off of our generator. We're still not anywhere near 4K watts yet. We have a 20 amp 4 prong cable that plugs into the generator. I stopped at home depot and bought a 14-50 plate with a box and fashioned a plug for the EV charger at the end of the generator's 30a cable.

On the Polestar 2's charging interface, you can limit the amps it draws from the charger. I started with just 5 amps and slowly increased it one at a time until I heard the generator struggle and then backed off. With everything else I was running, I was able to dedicate 2.8kw of power to the EV. I let that sit over night and had 65% charge in the morning. It's slow, but completely viable. As long as we can power the generator, all of this is a working solution. There's a joke in there somewhere about burning fossil fuels to charge the EV (for one day, lol) but I don't let that rhetoric bug me.

We do own a CX5 and worst come to worst, we can drive that. I didn't want to use the gas in that car since gas was getting pretty scarce to begin with. I tried to use the EV as much as possible instead. It's just an option if we had to. 

Now we had a new problem. Our local grocery stores had no power and all perishables.... perished. Some stores remained open on a cash basis, but only offered non-perishables. The panic buyers cleaned out anything of real value. Bottled water and sports drinks were completely gone as well. Fortunately, I keep a lot of canned food and we have food stock in a deep freezer. We're not afraid of tap water either.

On the 5th day we still didn't have power, but many areas of town did. I stopped by a Sheetz and their level 3 chargers were online. In 25 minutes, I topped the car off to 90%. Good for another two weeks.

That week was hard.  Debris, trees, power lines, and telephone poles blocking the streets. Gas stations without power. Gas stations without gas. People competing for resources, hoarding, and panic buying.  Empty grocery stores. We had to cook like we were camping every day.

The one thing that was never really a problem was the EV.

I know that is circumstantial. We have a generator. The EV had a decent charge when this happened. We had a resource that most our neighbors didn't. However, if Sheetz doesn't have power to charge the EV, they don't have power to pump gas either. If we can't get gas to power the generator, we can't gas a car either. Once they had power, gas everywhere was gone in two days, while the chargers still stood. It's also fair to point out that if I didn't have a generator, I still don't think the EV would have hit zero before Sheetz had power again.

There is a scenario where none of this is possible. Many people don't own a generator.  If the power went down, in the entire state, and gas everywhere was gone, you would have a hard time charging an EV. You would probably have a hard time gassing the car, too. This wasn't the collapse of the United States or the zombie apocalypse though. This was a common scenario where a bad storm knocked out power for a week. If someone lived in an apartment, relied strictly on public charging networks, and left their car at 5% charge they would probably be screwed.

My own personal take away is that I should top the car off more at home. If a storm is on the horizon, I should prepare a little better.

My advice to anyone potentially shopping is as such

* Don't do it if you can't charge at home. It's ridiculously convenient and it costs us $3.80 to charge from 20% to 90%. If you're willing to deal with 100% public charging then you are braver than I am. Here electrify America Charger charge us $0.56kwh while our rate at home is $.065kwh.   It costs a little more than $30 to charge our car using their superchargers - about the same as gas
* Depending on the car, you may not need some $600 charging station and $2000 to have it installed at home. I ran the outlet myself and it was probably $150 in parts only because HD charges too much for small runs of wire.  Find out for what a particular car needs before buying anything.  If you need to upgrade your whole panel that will likely cost a lot of money.  That particular project cost me $1600 for 200a service and 30 breakers.  The service itself was already 200a and did not need upgraded.
* I just told you that the upgrade cost $1600.  I originally didn't do it because the internet told me that would cost anywhere from $4K to $6K.   Don't believe the internet - get quotes yourself.  My electrician was also smart enough to know that if the charging unit has GFCI then its bad to put it on a GFCI breaker and installed it the way the manufacture said instead of arguing semantics about code.
* If you can charge at home, *and* you have a garage or shed to store a small generator, that is a good investment even if your generator sits for 2 years before using it.  It isn't just about the car, but not losing $300 of food in the fridge and $300 in the freezer, and not being hosed because the grocery store ran dry as well.
* If you live in a city like mine with just *one* supercharger, its a good idea to back it up with a gas car. I am just being practical.

I wrote this a while ago, and there's been a development since. I learned how to power the entire house with the generator by running a 50 amp cable from the generator to the house's EV plug. That's right. I turn off the service shutoff breaker and feed electricity back to the panel via the 50 amp plug in the garage. I turn off breakers it doesn't have the juice to run like the AC and the range. I can still trickle charge the EV using the 20a plug exactly the way I was doing it before. Someday I will upgrade the generator as I would like AC as well.  I read that you're not supposed to do this without an expensive switching system or at least a simple breaker lock that doesn't allow both to be on at the same time. Safety first of course.

I have also had people suggest that I buy an inverter and I can run the fridge and freezers off of the car itself.  I looked into that.  Unfortunately it looks like the Polestar 2 isn't readily capable of that, as it only charges it's 12v battery while its moving.",607,273,1726514567,"This experience is a good reason for always be charging, especially during storm seasons. | I didn't have an EV during hurricane Sandy, but 19 days with no grid power I did learn that gasoline powered vehicles were basically useless in a grid down situation. 

Whatever stations still had gasoline and power to pump it were inundated with people buying it for generators (we were using ~7 gallons a day for ours, 125 gallons in total), at which point the stations tanks would be drained in a matter of hours. 

Diesel I could still get no problem. Natural gas still worked the whole time. Propane tanks were still available. 

After that I bought myself a tri-fuel generator and I've since done a solar setup that can at least run my fridge and L1 charge my EV. 

I've even converted my lawn care equipment to electric. I'd rather deal with gasoline as little as possible. | Thank you for sharing.

  
This is exactly why weather-resilient green building is something every city should be looking into and seriously investing into. Many of the old towns in my state are not prepared for this sort of weather that will become more common as the years go by. All of the housing developments, as usual, are kept cheap as possible favoring fashion over form in terms of climate change including solar and backup battery compatibility. Honestly, simply just a baffling decision to continue to allow such developments in 2024.

  
And this is how it will be for those who still live in older homes for the foreseeable future. It's honestly just down right scary because housing developments built 30 years ago weren't meant to be able to handle the climate that we'll be seeing in a few years from now. People who only go for the bare minimum out of pure choice will soon find out that sort of behavior isn't going to cut it pretty soon when it comes to all things housing related. | Something lots of folks who whine about a generator running on gasoline, powering your EV, won't understand, is that while their car gets 30mph, a gas generator's efficiency is way better. 

Efficiency a generator that size makes about 5kw of power per gallon, depending on load.  Some do up to 7kw.

If you ran the generator on 4 gallons of gasoline (the tank size your model comes with) would get a small car 120 miles.  if 20% of your car's battery is 50 miles, that jump from 25% to 65% means on that 4-gallon gas tank you got 100 miles of range... plus you powered your house/fridge.

That's far better than the average 30mpg most folks get, and I'm being generous about the 30mpg because, in a power outage situation, you're more likely driving for a gasoline ""City"" mileage.. | This is why I want to get a massive solar array.

I think the biggest factor that is holding people back is not range anxiety, but rather battery life skepticism, largely driven by the smartphone industry.

If ICE cars, the difference between driving something 30 years old and a new car is often day and night.

I wanted to use trams vs busses as example, but that isn't particularly good example as we also have trolleybusses in some areas and they are replaced same as busses, more often, mainly because old trams still have looks appeal, they are driving on even surfaces all their life, can be upgraded and drive for very long time. While any transport dealing with potholes on the road will have issues later in life even if the suspension etc. is repaired.

  
So... I am not sure if we will see EVs live for much longer time. Technically 0-60 in say 6 seconds is all normal people need and if battery change is easy and much more cheap in future, maybe they will be near indestructible in markets without rust and many people will drive them for decades but it could be same as with ICE that after a while they look old visually and there is damage, rattling etc. from going over potholes the whole life",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

Because they are? Every time someone talks about TCO (total cost of ownership) that's a big part of it. 

  
Of course *some* manufacturers would have you believe you need a similar service schedule as in an ICE. They like that revenue stream too much. | They do! Just not ever dealership is as on it, because they make the bulk of thei rmoney thru maintenance. | Because for most new car buyers, it's almost irrelevant. It only matters for used car buyers. New car buyers sell the car and replace it before 8 years on average. 

No oil changes? That's like $100 a year, and most dealers will give you free oil changes for the first several years of ownership anyway. Also modern ICE vehicles need very little service in the first 5 years except for oil changes. | People do talk about the lack of maintenance needs with an EV, but if we're being honest with ourselves a basic modern ICE vehicle also has pretty minimal maintenance requirements. | Because less maintenance is not a major benefit. At best it's a minor one. I'm married and have 3 kids that are driving age so 5 cars total I regularly maintain. Only mine is an EV. Modern ICE cars have a 10k mile oil change interval, maybe 50k on the transmission, and 100k on the spark plugs. One of my cars has a timing belt that'll need replacing at 150k. Modern car maintenance is not a big deal.

My biggest maintenance expense per mile driven is tires and EVs very much still have those. They also still have brakes but I suspect my EV brakes will last a lot longer thanks to regen. | I love my Ioniq 5 and I'll never drive a gas car again.  But less maintenance has not been my experience. 

 I never once took my 2020 Sante Fe in for a recall.  My I5 has been in for 3 recalls (software) and one weird problem where the HUD failed.  

The wipers on my I5 needed replacing at about 8 months but the Sante Fe wipers lasted years.  

I was told I needed to rotate my I5 tires at various intervals due to greater weight but that wasn't a big thing for the Sante Fe.  

Yes the Sante Fe had oil changes every 3000 miles or so.  But my I5 has a weird dielectric battery fluid that costs anywhere from $400 - $800 that needs changing at 40K miles.  So the 13 oil changes in that 40,000 miles and the dielectric fluid change are at least in the same ball park for price.  

And you don't have to take off the front bumper to change oil in a gas car. | The thing with EVs is this at this time, there is very little maintenance and the costs are low, but repairs can be expensive because few people are able to perform them and there are not many 3rd party replacement parts manufacturers.  For example, if the on-board charger on an EV needs to be replaced, chances are that only the manufacturer or dealer can do it, and it's going to be expensive. Same for a heat pump or PTC heater.  This should normalize once EVs are more common on the roads, but that will still take a while. | That pisses off their dealerships. lol

Also EVs are coming in from the upper tiers and if you have the money for a premium EV, saving a few hundred for not having to do oil changes isn't going to be your main driving factor. | My gas car goes into the shop once a year for routine maintenance. If I bought an EV, it would go into the shop once a year.

A warning to potential Chevy Equinox EV buyers,"I just recently pulled the trigger on our new family car, the Chevy Equinox EV, about 3 weeks ago.

The use of the Google play store to install and use a small number of apps to further enjoy the in car experience is also a nice inclusion. Unfortunately all of these features go away without an OnStar package for data through AT&T. This puts important features like traffic data for Google maps and access to in car apps behind a paywall. The cheapest package is $35 a month and the most expensive package at $52. 

I wouldn't be making this post if there was the inclusion of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. It may go without saying but Tesla charges $10 a month for what they call Premium Connectivity that would include all the features like in car apps and map traffic data.

"Drivers of traditional cars have 'really poor' knowledge of EVs, shows survey",,592,183,1725351718,"**Breaking news:** People who haven't used a technology have poor knowledge of said technology.


/Shocked Pikachu face | The statements covered costs of owning and running an EV, charging, the natural resources needed to build and run an EV and even the likelihood of a fire. For example:

* **Nearly two-thirds (62%) of petrol drivers believe it's more expensive to own and run an EV**, with only 14% correctly recognising that EVs are typically cheaper. A report from ECIU found that the drivers of the top 10 selling petrol cars of 2023 can find themselves paying a petrol premium of Â£700 a year in running costs, compared to an equivalent electric car.

* **41% of petrol drivers incorrectly think that EVs are more likely to catch fire than petrol cars**, with only 24% correct in their understanding that they are less likely to catch fire. Evidence from EV Fire Safe indicated that EVs are more than 80 times less likely to catch fire than petrol or diesel cars.

* **More than half (59%) of petrol drivers thought the UK's electricity grid will not be able to cope**with the UK's shift to EVs, whereas only one in five (20%) correctly identified this statement as false. The National Grid has explicitly labelled this a myth' and is clear that the power system will be able to cope with millions more EVs in the UK 

* **80% of petrol drivers think the UK is not on course to install the charging infrastructure it needs**, despite the country being ahead of schedule to hit its target of 300,000 chargers on the UK's roads by 2030.

* **More drivers (35%) incorrectly believed that an EV's lifetime CO2 emissions are no less than those of a petrol car**than correctly identified this statement as false (32%). An EV being driven in the UK produces three times less lifetime CO2 emissions that an equivalent petrol or diesel car. | I bet drivers of traditional cars have really poor knowledge of traditional cars too | There was an old ad campaign that stated, I've never tried Guinness, because I don't like it. I think a similar statement can be made about EV critics, I've never driven an EV, because I don't like them. | God the mirror is awful.  It claims that of the 10 questions asked:

1. 23% of people get 0 correct
2. 57% of people got 2 or fewer correct
3. 90% of people got 5 or fewer correct

And yet - it does not show that the questions were.  After claiming that less misinformation is needed, it then goes on to engage in misinformation.  It says:

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has released figures indicating that 37,741 new electric cars were bought by private buyers in the first seven months of the year.  This marks a 9.5% drop compared to the same period in 2023, despite the overall new car market up by 5.5%.

While this is true, it clearly infers that people are buying fewer EVs which is not at all the case.  Instead, people are accessing EVs through fleet incentives rather than private sales, which the Mirror neglects to mention.  BEV sales are up 10.5% YoY, growing faster than the overall market. | OK, now do the same survey on dealer employeesâ€¦ | I would argue that they have poor knowledge even of their own car. | Legit.

Very PC way of saying that Daily Mail readers are fucking morons. | As we say in the UK

The Daily Fail fails, daily. | The DM, like much of the right wing media is anti-EV.

Kentucky electric cars now pay two taxes where gas cars only pay one,,587,297,1704196699,"Reminder:

Full details on our ""policy, not politics"" rule [are available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/wiki/rules/politics/)

edit:

I'm doubling back and marking this one as **misleading** as well, per several discussions in the comments â€”Kentucky is not *double-taxing* EV owners, they're attempting to (albeit imperfectly) equalize road taxation across different vehicles. It's notable the article also includes several deceptive claims and citations for them, including the oft-discussed [1960s-era AASHO Road Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASHO_Road_Test) which predates modern road construction techniques and weight regulations.

You can thank our friends at ALEC for this. | There should only be one tax for this.. Ohio has us pay 200$ annually to register.

Electric Minivans. Why aren't manufacturers rushing to make EV Minivans?,"Why aren't auto manufacturers, anywhere in the world including China where Minivans are seen as luxury, rushing to make electric Minivans? 

They'd be the perfect EV vehicles.

1. Long floor for a giant battery, maybe upto 170kWh batteries, and at EPA rating of 3mi/kWh efficiency, easy to get range of 400mi+.

2. Can be made aerodynamic, unlike trucks and gigantic SUVs which due to their high ground clearance and massive front fascia, get abysmal efficiency.

3. With an optimized powertrain, potentially purchasing from Lucid, you can have a 600hp AWD, electric minivan with 0-60 of sub 5 seconds, going as long as 400miles or more per charge at 70mph speeds.

4. Electric Minivans would have more space than a combustion minivan, massive front truck and seats folding down in the rear, a 7ft or maybe longer flat floor behind the driver and front passenger seats possible.

5. If the battery is in two parts, the middle seats could possibly be stow and go like the Pacifica has, potential of massively capable vehicle.

6. With a Lucid/Rivian/Tesla approach of a software defined vehicle, massive cost cuttings possible on an EV minivan, with reduction of cost in so many separate little control units spread out.

7. An inbuilt vacuum, On-Board power delivery capabilities like the Lightning, Cybertruck, Silverado EV, a perfect vehicle for camping.

8. With the additional strength that a battery pack provides, a minivan with 600hp can be made to tow up to 12500 lbs, potentially able to pull small camping trailers. On camping sites, simply plug in your minivan at the 40amp 240v outlets and you're not getting the smell of burning fossil fuels neither the added heat.

9. You don't even need the camper trailer. Your minivan could be the space you live in! Like those van-build videos that are rampant on YouTube.

10. If battery scaling is achieved, the electric minivan could still be under $60k, cost next to nothing in maintenance, and about 85% lower to fuel than a gas minivan like the Odyssey.

11. In the US, it could become eligible for the $7500 credit, and become even cheaper.

In my opinion, Lucid or Rivian should go after this massive untapped market. Integrate Supercharger access, and you could potentially go from LA to NYC with as little as 6/7 charging stops, and not even spend any money on staying in hotels, just sleep in the minivan with 7ft of flat floor.

2023, minivan sales were about 240k in the US. Most minivan owners, unlike owners for small SUVs, or small sedans, live in homes. Perfect for charging at home. Assuming a 25% market share, Lucid and Rivian have an available market share of at least annual sales of 60k vehicles, and honestly, they could be priced at $70k, and still turn out to be cheaper than the $50k gas Minivans in 5 years. ",584,484,1723226754,"In his recent MotorTrend interview the Rivian CEO touched on this topic.   They have tons of ideas for awesome vehicles, but they need to focus on vehicles that can have big sales numbers at this point.

Toyota sold 283k Rav4 in just the US.  Going after a piece of a total market of 240k is not as attractive.

Also, do you see how 170kWh battery today is absurdly expensive and making up some figures about a possible future when you could do that for $60k is just hopes and dreams? | Minivans don't sell. | Because minivan in the US account for less than 4% of total auto sales and have been declining for years, sadly. Maybe if the IDBuzz sells like hotcakes, we'll see someone else come out with one, but that seems doubtful at the expected Buzz price. Lucid and Rivian didn't sell 60k vehicles combined in 2023. | The market isn't massive compared to other models most manufacturers still don't have yet like mid-size 3-row suvs. | I honestly think they are a perfect choice but minivans are just not very popular. I love minivans, they feel so much more roomy with storage and three rows than three row SUVs do. If you don't use the third row they have a huge amount of cargo space so they have a lot of flexibility, especially those with easily changeable seats. They also have a lot of safety advantages compared to SUVs.

I literally don't get why they aren't more popular compared to the larger SUVs or even the moderate sized ones. I truly think 90% of it is folks growing up thinking of them as mom-cars and not wanting a mom-car when the equivalent, for decades, has been SUVs. They just do the job worse.

Sorry to for the rant, I just find the preference for SUVs, ESPECIALLY those with third row seats, absolutely crazy. Don't get me wrong, SUVs are fine but most of them seem to just do a worse, or more expensive job of the same thing as either minivans or sedans/hatchbacks and it blows my mind. I am sure there are some cases where they are ideal, but for the vast majority I think they are functionally a pretty mediocre choice. I think its gotta be about looks/style for most buyers and I don't find many of them appealing. I don't find minivans nice looking either, but if anything I like that they tend to be a bit more streamlined looking. | One vote for a mini van is people in wheelchairs.

A Full 9% Of Electrify America Charging Attempts Fail,,579,198,1719735213,"The real issue is the success rate is much lower than it needs to be. Failure rate can only be measured if the stall is partially operational.  If the stall is not operational at all and there is a long line or no one can charge at all at that entire site, that is the biggest failure.  

Tesla overcomes these problem by deploying a large number of redundant banks of 4 stalls each.  Even if an entire bank of 4 is down, there is usually sufficient capacity with the other stalls in that location to get a large number of customers through.  Tesla also quickly fixes charging stalls that are down and has great awareness with their software so they can automatically see which stalls are most likely not working since no one is using them and which stalls are charging slower than they should be. | Currently driving from Philly to Chicago this weekend in an EV6GT. My first stop was an EA station, had one failed charger out of 4. I've hit up Shell recharge stations and a Supercharger in Pittsburgh.

Will be hitting up some EvGo and EA stations today as the journey continues.

Honestly, even with ""THE CHARGING PROBLEM!!"" I'm finding road tripping to be far more relaxing in an EV. | [deleted] | I'm suspicious of this reporting, since my personal experience with EA stations is closer to a 20% fail rate.

>By comparison, Tesla's supercharger network works 95% of the time or better. Still, it's an improvement.

For EA, they use the failure rate (9%).  For Tesla, the success rate (95%).  They should use the same way of reporting this for both.

E.g. EA had a success rate of 91%, up from 89%, where Tesla had a success rate of 95%.

IMO, both should be over 99% overall success rate and need to improve.

In my part of the country, I've experienced an EA success rate of over 99%.  I've had one failed charge attempt, out of a couple dozen or so, solved by moving to the next charger over.  That was in MD.  I gather it's a lot worse on the West Coast though.  I've experienced a failure rate much higher than that with Tesla, but the sample size is even smaller.

Appleis canceling a decadelong effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn't public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating OfficerJeff WilliamsandKevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team â€” known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG â€” will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executiveJohn Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and vehicle designers. It's possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it's unclear how many.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort called Project Titan that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry.

AI = Actually Indians | Oh so AI is Actually Indians (in a call center) again. | This is pretty much par for the course with self-driving platforms. Some speculation suggested that Waymo was as high as 1:1 remote drivers to vehicles during their launch window. 

On the other hand, this still doesn't look great for Tesla given their (Elons) constant chest beating about the superiority of their platform. | California regulations require companies testing autonomous vehicles on public roads to have trained remote operators available to help passengers and law enforcement if something goes wrong. Why didn't Gizmodo mention that? | My 2018 Model 3 is in the shop getting the entire drive system replaced (thankfully under warranty, but I think this is the last straw for us) and I've got a loaner that has FSD(S), whereas our car lacks the required hardware. 

In trying it out, I'm finding that FSD(S) is capable in a way that could definitely lull you into a false sense of security, but it also REALLY struggles and outright fails with what seem like pretty basic road operations in what I'd think of as barely edge cases. Today it froze up when it was supposed to drive on a road that runs under an overpass, because it couldn't handle the bridge supports intruding on the edges of the road. To be clear, this was the route **it had chosen**, not me, but it couldn't do it. 

If Tesla is seriously planning to put cars that don't have pedals or steering wheels on not just *the road*, but on *every road*, as opposed to Waymo's geofenced system, and do it in the next 24 months, it's going to need a robust staff of remote monitors and drivers to take over when the system inevitably fails hard. | TBH I've always thought that that would be the only way it would work.

You have ""Self Driving"" robo taxis... And a button. Pressing the button alerts a person somewhere that you're having trouble. That person takes over the driving remotely to get you out of the weird situation.

That person can then set up blocks for certain known bad paths if they happen frequently enough.

And a report for every time an intervention is made to the AI trainers to train for that particular issue.

And then you can slowly reduce your remote driver employee count over time as your software gets better and better. But I'd be surprised if it ever goes away completely. Even if it's one out of a million drives, you'll still need a few remote drivers.

----------

I also think it's a given that eventually they'll have to build a map of everywhere that's driven that's updated every time a car drives by.

Road issues like dim or confusing road lines, potholes, etc are sent to the jurisdiction that handles them to be fixed.

But the AI needs a robust, current, updated map as well as just handling the road as it exists now. It needs to know if there's an accident or if a part of the road is closed or if lane changes or detours have happened. I genuinely don't think it needs to be as detailed as the Waymo system is - it should be fine to be a visual update as each car drives by.

And if we're going to get to being able to drive on snow, it's going to need to know where the lines are supposed to be so it can drive without being able to see the lines.

VW recently launched its ID.3 compact electric car for 29,760 euros - but only temporarily. In the middle of the decade, fully electric cars from the core brand as well as Cupra and Skoda are to be launched permanently for around â‚¬25,000 before an electric car for â‚¬20,000 or less is introduced. According to Der Spiegel, the Group is considering doing away with the infotainment screen that is mandatory in modern cars so that the price limit of 20,000 euros is not exceeded.

Bring your own device' is the internal name given to the idea. After all, the driver's smartphone can also play music or plan the route. This has already been implemented in the now discontinued e-car version of the up! subcompact. CitroÃ«n is also following this path with the Ã«-C3, which was initially launched this year for 23,300 euros and is expected to be available from under 20,000 euros in 2025 with a smaller battery and therefore less range.

VW's â‚¬20,000 electric car is set to celebrate its world premiere in 2027. A first teaser image was recently published. The Core brand group will put affordable electric vehicles from Europe, for Europe' on the road, the company announced in June. The Group's Core brand group includes VW, Å koda, Sest/Cupra and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. There is also already a preview of Å koda's â‚¬20,000 electric car.

The reportedly advanced negotiations with Renault about a co-operation for small fully electric cars have now been cancelled. The Volkswagen Group is therefore realising its 20,000-euro electric cars on its own. | I mean there's no inherent reason why EVs needs a big screen. It just looks cool. There's a market out there for cars that are just cars - but with electric motors - without all the bells and whistles. | This is not new step for VW. They already have the new-small-family model (Skoda citiGo, VW Up, Seat Mii) that had the same option - instead of infotainment, the car had BT and you had an app that displayed and controlled the important aspects.

No problem on my end - lots of cars even now have better results from Android Auto/iPhone integration than you get from integrated infotainment system. So at least as Skoda Enyaq user, I would definitely welcome the option :D | So it's not coming with a backup camera? | I don't get it. Is the screen really that expensive? You can get an Android tablet for like $50 that is probably equivalent to the cheap screens they put in cars. 

I feel like they should at least include a small screen that only does CarPlay/Android Auto. It would cost nothing. | That's funny.  A big screen is cheaper than lots of buttons. | Isn't rear camera obligatory in the USA because they estimated that cost of adding screen and camera is between $9-$13 (depending if car already had a display or not)?

Big ass iPad Pro is 2000â‚¬ and it can do much more than just let you pick few options and transmit CarPlayâ€¦

My point being it's more like steel wheels just to show off it's a poor version. | Great!

Apple learned valuable information and from that intel they decided the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. | For a company worth a couple of trillion dollars, a R&D of 1 Billion isn't far fetched. A ton of things might have come out of it in terms of tech level enhancements to things like CarPlay and future CarOS integration. | People underestimate benefits of prototyping and working on not related to the main work technology for engineering and design teams. It's all about exploration and creative process. Think about fashion shows. Designs looks wired and cringe, but it's not about final results, the goal is to borrow some small pieces from the projects where you wasn't limited by norm and tradition and include in your main work. 

We all know and love CarPlay, but you can't create something so great without understanding how to design something more than individual part. Like the whole car. Otherwise it wouldn't be different from cheap aftermarket infotainment systems.

We end up swapping ""war stories"" (him late 60s Nam, me damn near every war after) while I showed him around the car.

He at one point started to talk about ""oil and all that"" and I stopped him and said, ""Yeah but what really sold me is that I can drive this for about 3 or 4 cents per mile. My old gas car was more like 25 or more. That part's pretty hard to beat"". He readily agreed!

"Study finds EVs are lowering electricity bills for all customers, not just EV owners - Charged EVs",,553,161,1713631345,"Confusing article.

It seems to be saying that, because the grid and the power plants are underutilized at night, a time when the whole system is basically loafing, the extra load from EVs can be met without much investment in infrastructure.

So the additional revenue from these nighttime-charging EVs is mostly additional profit. Thanks to regulation, the profits cannot all be returned to utility shareholders, and must instead be returned to customers in the form of lower rates and fewer rate hikes. | TL;DR: Overnight charging levelizes demand and reduces more expensive dynamic adjustment to grid generation such as firing up NG 'peaker' plants. | And lowering bills for gasoline customers.

The largest oil exporter is currently sanctioned by many all over the planet and it's oil facilities are actively being bombed....yet oil prices have only risen modestly.  

How is that possible? Only because millions of people all over the world have switched to electric vehicles.  The EU and China have made a pretty significant shift.  But the surprise people that are kicking gas is the developing world.  Electric scooters, bikes, Tuk-tuks, quadracycles, motorcycles, etc have seriously slowed oil demand. | Doesnt feel any lower :( | It sure as hell hasn't lowered the rates we pay in California. Since 2020, my rates have almost doubled. I'm currently paying $.52/kW at the winter rate, and the summer rate is surely going to be higher again this year.

I think solar is having whatever impact they're measuring, not the extra consumption of EV's. | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Power bill is up, rates are up, and no rate hike end in sight | News of this has yet to reach California :) | I've said for years that EV drivers were subsidizing and even lowering a lot of the grid costs on a per kWh basis.  

What makes electricity so expensive are all the giant ups and downs in overall demand throughout the day.  The flatter the demand, the less fluctuation and costs that need to be put in to stabilize the grid.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe thinks the EV industry needs to stop copying the Tesla Model Y,,555,302,1721711932,"Y'all need to read the article. He heaped tons of praise on Tesla.

The road is full of Model Y shaped ICEs too | [deleted] | Make the Rav4, CRV of EVs. Ford should do a Bronco EV. Chevy made a blazer EV | In a universe with the laws of physics that we have, you're always going to have a vaguely Model Y-shaped design for a mid-size crossover, since that's what aerodynamics dictate is most efficient.  But you can certainly have interesting designs which still respect those aerodynamic realities.

A big part of the reason I like my EV6 is that it is both really stylish (IMO--style is subjective, after all) and also really aerodynamically efficient.  You can have both. | I wish someone would try copying Tesla's Supercharger network. | He's right, the EV market is overcrowded with Model Y analogues, right down to the price point. At this point, adding more doesn't do much to improve EV adoptability; barring the long-haul EV holdouts who probably aren't going to convert for at least another 4-8 years anyway, anybody who has wanted a Model-Y-alike by now probably already has one.

We need more form factors across a wider variety of price points. In the long term, there needs to be a full electric equivalent of every currently sold ICE vehicle if mass adoption is the goal. This isn't going to happen overnight which is fine, but automakers need to be making serious moves to make it happenâ€¦ don't just pump out yet another barely distinguishable midsize crossover into a saturated market and act all surprised that it isn't selling at the desired rate. | Steve o! | I thought this was going to be a clickbait title, but no: 

> We see that evidenced through the really positive reaction to the R2. The R2 very intentionally, much like we did with R1, is not trying at all to be a Tesla Model Y. It's going to compete from a price point of view, with very similar pricing. It's a very similar size. It's slightly shorter than a Model Y, but it's not trying to replicate a Model Y.

Tesla Refutes Suspension Issues As U.S. Senators Ask For Recall,,552,385,1703782857,"I have a 2019 model 3 and has control arm issues fixed with spray foam under warranty in 2021 and issue resurfaced in 2023 just outside of warranty. I believe this is a widespread known issue. | Damn, suspension issues aside, this article is all over the place. It starts talking about the issue described in the headline, then moves onto a possible $25K future model, to robo taxis, to the economics of used EVs on dealer lots. I had to read through it twice because I thought I was going crazy. Further, the article barely touches on the actual refutation alluded to in the headline other than to say they covered about 3/4ths of the repairs under warranty. 

Am I being too harsh or is this article total trash? | 2018 Model 3. $1,600 for all the parts/labor (Control arm, correction link, compliance links).  Maybe I'll get that refunded after the recall is forced!  Beer time!!! | Owner of a 2019 M3 LR here. If you do a search on failure points, upper control arms are a common problem. I had mine replaced under warranty (front only) at the end of my warranty period this past Spring. I have no first hand knowledge of other Tesla owners having a catastrophic suspense failure, and I'm not sure how big of an issue something needs to be before it's considered for recall. That said, I think it's safe to say that all cars have  failure points (my Audi was coil plugs and oil sludge), so I'm not sure how this one stands out against the rest, but if Tesla ends up warranting this piece beyond the standard 4 years then yay! | So I paid $350 to replace my upper control arm.  Can I get a refund?  [Here's my receipt](https://imgur.com/a/X7j3WUE) | Is this the same suspension issue that was mentioned in that German TÃœV report about safety inspections on cars older than 3 years where Tesla managed to finish dead last? | The issue is real.  While I was having other repairs done, Without telling me or getting my permission Tesla sprayed foam on my front control arms to keep them from breaking til after my warranty expired. | That's funny because when I got my upper arm controls replaced, the Tesla service advisor said that it is a known issue in the company and the new revitalized suspension is supposed to fix it. | While I do love my 2019 Model 3, it did have a lot of suspension parts replaced under warranty.

My country has annual safety inspections for every vehicle that begin once a car reaches three years of age. A few months prior to its first inspection it had the squeaky suspension at the front which Tesla fixed by replacing the front upper control arms. Later that year during its inspection it failed due to:
* Rear left and rear right knuckle upper rose joints having excessive movement
* Front left and right compliance links had excessive movement
* Front left and right lateral links had excessive movement

Some of these parts had to be ordered in and due to the way inspections work here, once the car has failed it cannot be driven. I didn't really have any complaints about how my Service Centre handled this tho as everything was replaced under warranty and while they were waiting for the parts to arrive they gave me a Model 3 loaner for the week.

At the time of inspection it was at around 70,000km | A more detailed look at the allegations around the suspension issues, if anyone is interested: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/

Makes it sound like all of California state are refusing Tesla cop cars. This is not state wide, but article only mentioning one department in the state who is according to the article, Ukiah Police department. Ukiah is a city of 16,000 people. It's a small spec of a city in comparison to the state itself. 

Plenty other divisions and municipalities have adopted. Irvine Police actually just launched a Cybertruck as part of their fleet. | I recall an argic about six months back with Canada's RCMP force looking at EV options, and Tesla posed a few problems, like the panaromic roofs.

> When we asked Tesla about the range gains, and especially about the relative change between EPA and 75-mph range, the company pointed to changes in the EPA testing methodology that rolled out for 2024 that require automakers to test in the best and worst modes and average the results, as well as continued improvements to the internal drag of the motor. The small improvement in the Model 3's coefficient of drag also helps more at highway speeds than in the slower EPA tests, as aerodynamic drag increases with the square of speed.

"China Revises Mandatory Standard for Passenger Car Fuel Consumption, Marking the End of ICE Cars on Jan 1st 2026",,550,124,1725564854,"Not surprising.  Tons of China automotive industry insiders have long considered 2025 to be the end of ICE technology. | I have read through the documents from MIIT(Ministry of Industry and Information Technology). The standard is mandatory and will be effective on 1/1/2026. Regarding energy consumption:

* Most ICE cars (including hybrid) must reach 2.57 liter per 100km, or 70 miles per gallon
* Most EV cars must reach 13.92 kwh per 100km, or 22.4 kwh per 100 miles

What this means is that

* Almost all ICE-only cars, and old-generation hybrids will have to quit the Chinese market in 2026
* Even if ICE-only cars can reach 70 MPG, they might not be competitive
* Hybrids especially PHEVs are quite feasible
* Many new EVs can meet the standard. However, some EVs from European makers will fail
* Because batteries are heavy, EVs will have an optimal battery size in each class.
* For cars can't reach above standard, the company can buy carbon credit for each car they will sell
* Some details mentioned on this page: https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20240828A0911400 | Good news for the planet | so this will basicaly fuck with any western car maker right? especially the premium market with big motors.

Sold my Model Y after a year and here is my advice to new buyers,"I want to start by saying that I believe in electric vehicles (EVs). Despite my negative experience with the Model Y Performance, I still consider EVs to be the future and suitable for many situations. My next vehicle will likely be an EV as well.

I purchased my Model Y P early in 2023, following the initial price reductions. I had been considering an SUV for a while but was also waiting for the post-COVID market to stabilize. At that time, Tesla was suggesting that the tax credit might end in April, which significantly influenced my decision to purchase when I did.

*I would like to begin with the positives:*

1. The car is not bad; it's neither good nor bad, but rather an average car.
2. It is a practical car with ample cargo capacity.
3. The car is quite fast, capable of out-accelerating many other vehicles on the road(Although after 65 it tapers down).
4. Both the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal are very responsive.
5. Similar to other electric vehicles, it may be advantageous over internal combustion engine cars depending on your charging setup.
6. The car's software is excellent, possibly the best in its class, with a well-designed and responsive interface.
7. The charging network is great.

*Unfortunately there are a lot of* ***negatives*** *that eventually led me to get rid of the vehicle.*

1. The build quality and quality control of the vehicle were terrible, despite it being a 2023 model which should have been a significant improvement over previous models. Upon taking delivery, I noticed numerous issues: misaligned panels, unpainted areas, and damaged paintwork. The interior had stains, the roof trim was improperly fitted with some parts detached, and the seats didn't fold correctly, among other problems. It required nearly ten service appointments to address the interior and some paint issues, yet many problems remained unresolved. It's worth noting that my experience isn't unique; there was consistently a queue at the service department, mostly with brand new Model Y vehicles.
2. The ride quality is harsh, despite supposedly being the upgraded, softer suspension(mine is the performance so it is stiffer than the regular suspension but still). It's not intolerable on the road, yet it's far from comfortable. Indeed, it's the stiffer performance suspension, and while I'm accustomed to the firmness of sport-tuned suspensions, this one is notably harsh. The suspension struggles to absorb the smaller, high-frequency bumps, and due to the elevated seating position, there's a noticeable amount of lateral vibration. Competing vehicles like Mach-e gt (magneride) were far better than that.
3. The interior quality is subpar, not even matching that of a $25K Corolla. Cars over $30K from brands like Toyota and Subaru feel better in comparison, while a $40K Mazda interior looks like a Maybach next to this vehicle. It's not the minimalist design I appreciate, but rather the fit, finish, and trim quality that are lacking. Although my Model Y Performance was an improvement over the earlier Model 3s I've driven, which were terrible, it still fell short. it is susceptible to developing rattles.
4. This vehicle performs poorly on anything other than asphalt. When I tried it on a flat unpaved gravel road, it was an awful experience. It was virtually impossible to exceed 5mph without experiencing excessive shaking, while regular sedans were able to go faster with much less discomfort.
5. Although the car lacks a bumper camera, it features unnecessarily large rims that limit tire options and are susceptible to curb rash if not handled carefully.
6. Depreciation and price reductions: This car experiences rapid depreciation. While a car is not an investment, few people drive their vehicles until they are no longer usable, making resale value a crucial component of the ownership equation. The problem is Tesla dynamically ""marks up"" their vehicles and screws their customers up so much. For instance, even if you purchased this vehicle after the initial price reductions last year for the high 50's, the base price has now dropped to nearly 50, and every few months, one might receive an additional $5k+ on an inventory vehicle. A loss of over $20K in the first year is substantial. It's sad to consider those who paid in the high 60s without any tax credit. With the added expenses of higher registration and insurance costs, it quickly surpasses any savings from electricity and other operating costs.
7. Although the straight-line performance is impressive, this vehicle is not designed for sports; its handling is averageâ€”neither good nor bad, just acceptable. Driving a Model 3 on a winding road can be somewhat enjoyable, but model y does not quite match up.
8. The range isn't poor, yet it's significantly less than the advertised figure, varying with use. Initially, it was claimed to offer a 303-mile range, but Tesla later adjusted this to 285 miles. Practically, the range is between 200-250 miles, unless one is driving at 35 mph in the city under warm conditions.
9. Many features seem underdeveloped. They eliminated ultrasonic sensors to save $100, yet promised vision-based parking. After a year, they released a version that's somewhat functional. However, it still has a significant blind spot in the front, lacks a complete 360-degree view, and it's often unavailable or inaccurate.
10. The service center experience was not good. Several times they didn't properly address the issue and other times introduced new problems while fixing some.  It felt like they were overworked.

# Now my advice for new buyers :

**Should you buy a Model Y now?** Honestly, NO. This car isn't worth the current base price; it's cheaply built. Additionally, it's an outdated design likely in its final production year. The new Model 3 seems to address some of the major issues, so the upcoming model Y might be a better option.

**Remember that you don't know exactly what you will get.** For instance, Tesla transitioned to hairpin motors in late 2022. The hairpin performance motor is designated as 4D1, while the older wire-wound motors are referred to as 3DX/980/990. Some buyers of the performance model still received the older 980 motor, whereas some regular Long Range buyers received the 4D1. It has been observed that even this year, some Performance models were equipped with the older, slightly less efficient 980/3D1 motor, while individuals who paid less for a Long Range received the 4D1. Although I was fortunate in the motor lottery, this practice is unacceptable. The switch from hardware 3 to 4 was made abruptly, and by sheer chance, some customers received the newer version while others did not. This randomness when spending such an amount is frustrating.

***If you want to buy***, Consider opting for a used, low-mileage 2022 or newer model. Starting with a $15,000 saving off the base price or more. Alternatively, if you prefer a new vehicle, wait for regular inventory discounts and combine them with the tax credit to minimize depreciation effects. If you're ineligible for the tax credit, again consider a used, low-mileage option.

Avoid rushing into a loan. Patience is key in the long term. I know people who intended to purchase a Model X and were exploring financing options for the remaining $20K. They ultimately refrained, and the vehicle's price subsequently dropped significantly more than that amount. They avoided a financial misstep. Taking on financing to cover what may essentially be a substantial Tesla markup would have sucked. Tesla's marketing can be misleading regarding prices, so trust only your research and historical data.

***Should I buy a new MY to save on fuel costs?***   For most people, this doesn't make sense. If you drive nearly 20,000 miles a year and plan to keep the vehicle for over six years, it might make sense. Otherwise, the depreciation, registration, and insurance costs can negate the savings on fuel and operating expenses. However, purchasing a used one with a significant amount of warranty remaining could be a viable alternative.

**If I live in an apartment?** Living in an apartment can be manageable if you have access to a supercharger nearby or the ability to charge at work. However, if the cost of electricity is high, you might end up charging at a supercharger late at night to benefit from a lower rate.

**Leasing ev's from other manufacturers seems like an interesting option.**

There are some attractive leasing options available from various manufacturers. These not only offer significant price reductions but also eliminate the obligation to purchase at the end of the lease if the depreciation is substantial. I have tested the Mach-e GT, Ioniq 5, and Volvo C40, and found that all these vehicles surpass the Model Y in terms of build quality and ride comfort. You have choices; take the time to test drive these vehicles and conduct your own research.

Hope this helps to new buyers,

Good luck

EU sticks to 2035 deadline for ban on sale of new petrol-driven cars,,544,120,1729068394,"2035 is 11 years from now, 11 years ago was 2013 the only real EV available then was the model S at I think 80k dollars with a 60kwh battery, which probably wasn't even sold in Europe at that time.

 A lot can change in 11 years

Edit: lots of people mentioning other EVs, but they all seem to have been primarily Europe at the time, which I don't have experience with. Europe has been leading in EVs so far. | Brussels is sticking to its controversial plans for curbs on combustion engines in the EU from 2035, according to internal documents, despite heavy pressure from the car industry to water down the incoming rules. 

Answers prepared for the bloc's climate chief Wopke Hoekstra for when he faces parliamentary hearings next month and seen by the Financial Times say the EU cannot and should not roll back its plan to outlaw the sale of new cars powered by fossil fuels. 

The law, announced in 2021, has come under fire from Europe's carmakers as they struggle with flagging electric vehicle sales and intense competition from Chinese manufacturers. 

Except for Renault, all the major European car manufacturers have issued profit warnings this year. Volkswagen, Germany's biggest private-sector employer, is considering shutting plants in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, it said last month. 

Industry body Acea has also warned that the sector could face millions of euros in fines when stricter rules come into force next year aimed at cutting overall emissions from cars in Europe by 15 per cent compared to a 2021 baseline. 

Italy has called on the European Commission to push back the ban, France is seeking more flexibility in how it is applied, while Germany's coalition government is in favour of keeping combustion engines for cars that run on alternative, environmentally-friendly fuels. 

Adolfo Urso, Italy's industry minister, warned last month that the 2035 combustion-engine ban threatened a crisis for European car manufacturing.

Hoekstra's briefing, however, argues that the new rules create predictability for investors and manufacturers and are essential for the bloc to reach its goals on reducing COâ‚‚ emissions, as well as to strengthen the competitiveness of the EU automotive industry.  
  
Julia Poliscanova, senior director at the NGO group Transport & Environment, pointed out that there would be no incentives to build battery factories if the ban were pushed back. Instead of undermining it, carmakers should instead focus on ways Europe can help build a competitive EV industry, such as an EU battery fund, and policies that reward clean, local manufacturing, she said.  
  
Leonore Gewessler, Austria's climate and energy minister, told the Financial Times that the future of the automotive industry is electric. She said Europe could not afford to fall behind on this technology, the way it had in smartphones despite it having an early mobile-phone champion in Finland's Nokia.  
  
The pressure to find more flexibility in the rules comes amid a broader groundswell of concern about the implementation of the EU's ambitious Green Deal climate law, which aims to push the bloc to cut emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Earlier this month, Brussels said it planned todelay its highly-contested deforestation lawby a year amid pressure both from trading partners and EU governments.  
  
A senior EU diplomat said the bloc needed to have honest discussions about countries' ability to reach the EU's 2030 goals. 

The combustion-engine ban is expected to be a contentious topic at hearings in the European parliament before the new team of commissioners can take office. | Good. Need to stay competitive versus China. Already, a quarter of EVs sold in Europe are Chinese, and this is only likely to increase if the EU waters down its regulations. | We would be having these same arguments in the US if the Auto and Oil lobbyists didn't own the government. | The problem that I have with these type of headlines and frankly also the article itself: it's much more nuanced. 2035 is a long path where slowly (but surely) the CO2 ceiling is lowered for cars.

The easiest way for a manufacturer would be to become EV only, but they can also choose to keep selling their heavy petrol sucking SUVs whilst offsetting those with large BEVs. Business wise switching over to BEV only just like that would kill the company of course.

A more sensible path could also be to transition your vehicle offerings across the group to lower CO2 overall. Which is exactly the path the EU is offering, but sadly always left out in these articles. | I thought Germany and Italy made sure earlier that ICE is not dead as long as it runs on eFuel?

Is eFuel just marketing with no chances of success? | Good job, EU. | GOOD | It should be 2030. But they chickened out. ICE cars are polluting our environment, they should fine ICE companies 10k+ per ICE car they build. | This is fucking based.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

2) Roundabouts, it's so noticeable when you just swoop-in and out of them, so much smoother.

3) When you're in queues, no stinking fumes. I have to actively shut off the fan-intakes (even if the fans are not on) in the car, because the cars in front will stink up my entire car-cabin while waiting in for example a drive-through.

4) If you have a garage in the house (which I do), you no longer need to worry about stinking up the house, or dangerous fumes.

5) Never visit a gas station, it's always ready to go after every night.

6) Silence and bliss - oh the bliss.

On those rare >200 mile days, it's generally to a city where we can charge, and/or we want a charging break anyway (who wants to drive three hours without a break?)  I think we'd have to go way out of our way to make a long road trip that *didn't* get us to or near any chargers. | It's a shame that EVs are caught into the culture war, as an EV with decent range is a solid fit for a lot of rural drivers.

It's rural drivers that usually have a lot more capacity for home charging than urban drivers, and it's generally a small minority of drivers that regularly drive in excess of a typical EV range.

If you are burning a lot of fuel to make trips into town that's an hour away regularly, an EV is going to cost a lot less than an ICE vehicle. | Semi-rural AR here. I can get to most areas of the state and back without much issue, as I have \~200 mile range.

I charge at home and start every day with over 200 miles of range. 

All of that said, I don't tow with my car, let alone tow a big horse trailer hundreds of miles over mountains at speed. I also don't take a lot of road trips, but when I do there are plenty of Tesla Superchargers wherever I'd want to go.

Like the cost of parts and one case of beer cheap. That's what I charged myself at least. I'm not actually surprised rural users are going electric when basically the only reason against using one for their daily driver is politics. There are far fewer  barriers to entry out in rural areas, electricity is often cheaper in the more rural states, and you don't have to drive miles into town to get gas every time you're low. They just wake up every morning with a full tank. A rancher that's just using his pickup to go check the animals or make a run to town isn't going to do 200 miles in a day ever and he likely has a larger truck for when he's actually hauling stuff.

I will point out that the most direct route from OKC to Denver is very sparse on DCFCs to the point that I won't be using my EV for that trip until the infrastructure changes. Even assuming a significant headwind (very very common going that direction), I shouldn't have a problem making it to the next DCFC even in the winter. The issue is that if a single one is out of service, I could be royally screwed.

According to the most recent data from the[United States Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/), the average American household consumes 10,800 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity a year. **That translates to approximately 900 kWh a month and 30 kWh per day.**

>2.4 gallons of gasoline

somewhere close to half of that is used to ***heat the radiator up.*** | >I didn't realize how little energy EVs carry.

Actually, EVs carry a huge amount of energy. I didn't fully appreciate how much energy was in an EV battery before I owned one. Every month when I look at my electricity bill, my Leaf consumes more kWh than my entire house. 

The proper takeaway here is that gasoline has an enormous amount of energy, and cars do a pretty crappy job of using it efficiently. | Combustion creates a lot of waste heat which can't be used for kinetic motion. Electric motors create very little waste heat. This is a problem for EVs in the winter when the cabin needs to be heated. | The internal combustion engine is - by its name - a heat engine, of which the efficiency is fundamentally capped by the Carnot Efficiency, which is entirely a function of the hot (peak combustion) and cold (environment) temperature. This means that regardless of any inefficiencies, your engine is never likely going to breach 40-50%.

In fact a good heuristic is the rule of thirds', that 1/3 of the fuel energy will be lost as waste heat via the exhaust, 1/3 will be inefficiencies such as heat loss, pumping, friction, etc, and 1/3 will become useable mechanical power. 

Electric powertrains aren't governed by the above rule, as they depend on electrochemical (battery) and electromagnetic (motor) phenomena. | it's mostly due to the way we convert gasoline into kinetic energy, the process of internal combustion produces a lot of heat, and most of that heat goes unused, it's just not an efficient process. not to mention all the gears and linkages and pistons and all the friction involved | Here's how I learned it in autoshop \~30 years ago.  The exact numbers are a bit different, and I think things have gotten slightly more efficient over the years.  But here's the simplistic energy breakdown.

In a gas engine, roughly 1/3 of the energy produced by combustion goes to propel the engine, 1/3 is used to cool the engine, and 1/3 goes out the tailpipe.

In contrast, electric motors convert something like 90%-95% of energy to motion.  In addition, electric motors can be used to recapture energy during deceleration, while a gas car cannot.  

Similar dynamics exist for most fossil fuel driven things.  Most gas or coal fired power plants are in the 30-40% efficient range.  This is important to understand when dealing with the ""we don't have enough energy to replace X in the energy transition"" crowd.  The major technologies involved in the energy transition involve dramatic increases in energy efficiency.  Search for ""Primary Energy Fallacy"" if you want good discussions on the topic. | > gasoline engines which can convert only about 30-40% of the chemical energy

- Unmodified/stock category: Hyundai Ioniq 5 N sets the record for electric production vehicles
- Modified category: Hyundai Ioniq 5 N beats a modified Model S Plaid
- Rivian R1T fastest unmodified truck
- Modified F-150 Lightning fastest truck overall

The race is still ongoing this weekend but chances are above finishes are in the bag. | I kind of want to have my 3rd midlife crisis and just trade in my 15 yo toyota for  a 5n. | Ioniqs and Rivian were a blast to watch.

I hope Rivian will race the R3X in the next couple years. | In the modified category, the Ioniq 5N TA (Time Attack) spec, which carries over the stock powertrain but has some software tweaks for more power and big wings on the front and back, was piloted by Dani Sordo to set a 9:30.852, which is now the fastest electric modified SUV up the mountain.
Notably, the modified 5N also beats the modified Model S Plaid, which set a best time of 9:54.901. That was a privateer effort by Unplugged Performance, not a manufacturer effort like Hyundai's, but it puts the 5N in rare company to be ahead of Tesla both in unmodified and modified form. | Ioniq 5 is a beast | >In fact, the R1T's time would have been an overall record for unmodified electric vehicles  and even was that record, for a few minutes  until the next car up the mountain, the Ioniq 5N, came in 4 seconds faster.

Tesla Sales Slump Won't Stop Record U.S. EV Sales In Q3,,534,318,1727384855,"Market is growing 8% while tesla is projected to contract 7%.

In Q2, Cox Automotive said Tesla's slice of EV sales had fallen to 49.7%. In August, it had dropped further to **44%**.

Interesting to see what their stock does next. | >The story is steady demand, a slower pace, yet record sales, Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights

This says it all. | Honestly I'm really shocked with the amount of crap information out there on social media about electric cars.  Those who have them like them.   Why is there so much bs out there? | I thought the Model Y was poised to become the best selling car in the US? At least that's what I read in an article just a few days ago. | 

>Cox projects 1.3 million EVs will be sold in the U.S. this year, up slightly from 1.2 million in 2023. It revised down its forecast earlier this year from 1.7 million units to account for slower EV adoption and an uptick in hybrid sales. 

Ooft. That's a hell of a revision. Particularly given that:

>In August, incentives on EVs hit 13.3% of their average transaction price, 80% higher than the average for traditional combustion vehicles. A loophole allows any model to qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit if the car is leased rather than bought, and that's boosted EV leasing.

I believe that's a record high on incentives (happy to stand corrected) [and we can see how far that has distorted the leasing market.](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/g4zzpg/s4/cox-automotive-q3-ev-forecast.webp)




Record sales sounds good on paper, but any growth = record sales. The issue is the stagnation that has now seen YoY quarterly growth dip to a paltry predicted 8%.

At this stage, monthly and quarterly YoY figures are likely to get worse before they get better (unless we see more incentive utilisation/implementation).

A recovery will come, the question is when - and who is going to drive it. I expect 2025 will see a big increase in model differentiation as manufacturers try and drive EV sales without actually investing in new model lines ahead of next gen platforms in the latter half of the decade. Basically, everyone gets an off-road trim, a special edition trim, a smaller, cheaper variant of an existing model, a bigger 3 row variant of a 2 row medium/large SUV, etc. | I'm currently looking at 3-4 yo EVs and there really isn't a lot of competition in that area - it's clear looking at the market, it's the Model 3 and then others'.

Looking at new cars today? The market is full of new, interesting EVs and it's a far more competitive environment.

China will be dominant that's for sure in BEV and EREV=PHEV. | *Western country import tariffs have entered the chat* | This article misses a very critical aspect of the auto industry: brand equity. One of the really interesting things about the Chinese auto market is that it is so new. Many people in China are still buying their first or second car ever. And they have no preconceived notions about ANY brand. All cars are basically the same to them and they'll buy anything if it fits their budget, looks good, and has the features they want. Vehicle driving dynamics and brand equity mean nothing. 

Western markets are completely different. Brand equity matters a LOT. People will buy an inferior car just because it has a BMW badge or a Honda badge, etc. There is an implied quality and reputation with these known entities. Chinese brands will struggle in the West just like Hyundai/Kia did at first (and in many ways still do) because they'll be seen as inferior products with no history. That won't last forever, but it does give Western automakers about a decade to course correct. 

Also, I really disagree with the author's take that Chinese brands simply understand their customers better and the West has been too lazy to bother to understand their markets. The Chinese government has pumped all of these brands with so much cash that they could build anything they wanted with no fear of financial repurcussions. Western brands in Western economies can't do that. No Western government is going to give blank checks to automakers for billions of dollars to create moonshot products. Western brands MUST be profitable for their shareholders which means they have to balance short term profitability with long term market growth. They are inherently at a disadvantage to Chinese brands.

"BHP rejects hydrogen and hybrids, will go straight to electric for giant haul trucks",,514,99,1719487854,"Article

>Electric excavators and battery haul trucks, not hydrogen or hybrid options, are preferred to displace diesel in iron ore mining, BHP says.

>However, the diversified miner's carbon footprint will get worse before it gets better as commodity production ramps up to meet global demand, investors were warned at a roundtable on Wednesday.

>It's not going to be a straight line, climate vice-president Graham Winkelman said, as the company grows to meet increasing global demand for its commodities, particularly Australian iron ore for making steel.

>BHP was on track for a credible financial year 2030 target of at least a 30 per cent reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2020, but emissions would rise in FY2024, he reiterated.

>Dr Winkelman said methodical and capital-efficient decarbonisation was an important part of the overall company strategy.

>It helps us build an increasingly sustainable and more resilient business, both of which are key to growing long-term value for our shareholders, he said.

>Some 10 per cent of executive remuneration is also linked to climate-related activities.

>Nigel Tame, BHP's head of steel decarbonisation partnerships, said they were working with companies responsible for one-fifth of world steel production on reducing emissions.

>The reality is, on current settings, it will take multiple decades for our steelmaking customers to transition, Dr Tame said.

>There is also no single decarbonisation pathway for the sector, he added.

>Steelmaking contributes up to nine per cent of global emissions, with no commercially viable net-zero technology available for widespread adoption.

>Similarly, technologies to replace diesel are emerging but are not yet commercially viable or available at the scale required.

>While some producers plan to rely on hybrid haulage trucks to get them through the next five years, BHP dismissed that option when quizzed by investment bankers.

>Nor does it favour the fuel-cell mining trucks being trialled by hydrogen bulls at Fortescue Group.

>Dan Heal, vice president of operational decarbonisation, said BHP would go straight to a battery electric truck as a diesel replacement in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

>He said retrofitting was an option but the transition would mostly be achieved via fleet replacement.

>The first electric truck fleet was expected to be in place by 2028 and the first of multiple electric locomotives would be deployed in 2030 if the technology develops at they believe it can.

>Far from the electricity grid, power requirements are also a challenge and are being met with renewable power purchase agreements.

>To counter the increase in emissions from business growth, BHP said it plans additional deployment of renewable electricity before 2030.

>Carbon credits would be needed to achieve the 2050 net zero goal, the company conceded.

>We are likely to source and relinquish carbon credits in coming years to meet compliance obligations under Australia's safeguard mechanism, Dr Winkelman said.

>But BHP would not count those compliance carbon credits towards achievement of the 2030 target, he said. | Smart. Mining is ~4-7% of the world's emissionsâ€¦ Increasing emissions in the short term is negligible at the scale of the transition. This is the correct move as mines, mine their own energyâ€¦ hydrogen is another complicated mechanical chore and the fuel needs far too much infrastructure. | the biggest thing in favour of electric for these sites is they are in the middle of fucking nowhere.

And you can skip a ton of traffic! | I've worked in above ground mining and it will be interesting to see how this develops.

It is a special case, but being non-highway diesel they get away with using relativly low grade fuel.  

So overall it is a specific case that needs a proper assessment of cost, needs and impact.

In subsurface, EVs make a large impact because running ICE below the surface then requires significant ventilation, but H2 or Battery Fires would also be particularly catastrophic. | No surprise.  Everything that moves on the ground will be BEV or overhead electric in the near-ish future. | The [the hydrogen ladder](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hydrogen-ladder-version-50-michael-liebreich) states that battery/electric is better for EVs and short-distance logistics, as well as most grid applications.

I live in rural western Pennsylvania, it's a very red section of the state. I honestly never expected that the car I drive to work with would be as devisive as politics. The amount of uninformed and stupid things people have said to me about my car has been mind blowing. 

The one day I walk in and an older guy instantly jumps down my throat. Angrily he says let's have a race across the country and starts spouting some nonsense. Like why the hell would I ever want to drive across the county, I literally just drive to work 6 days a week.

I've been told that there's a tik tok video of someone saying it takes them 2 weeks to charge their car. 

A friend of a friend's dad has a Tesla and the car ordered him a $40,000 battery all on its own.

I'm honestly not surprised by it, but it's crazy the absolute hostilely over a car that someone else doesn't have to use.

She pulled the ""it's just a joke"" card, but it's not. It's anti-ev rhetoric couched in a joke and it's fucking absurd. This joke came about after she told me that it's not cheaper to own an electric because you have to pay to charge. I was like ""are you getting your gas for free?"" and that ended thar discussion.

I like that the headline confidently says that global emissions are declining, but then in the article says ""emissions **could** decline in 2024"".

They're suggesting China's EV and renewable energy growth is leading the charge to global emissions decline.  However, China is adding about 15-20 million additional vehicles (cumulative) to their roads annually and has been for the past 2 decades, which has no doubt helped keep global emissions rising to new records nearly each and every year.    First time car buyers transitioning away from public transit/micro-mobility, whether the cars are gas or electric, will always result in an increase in energy use, and emissions.

If China maintains the pace they're adding cars to their total in-use vehicle tally, they could have an additional 90 million automobiles on their roads by the end of 2030.  6 years from now.   350 million on their roads in 2024, increasing to 440 million by 2030.

Revenue is down at Tesla and this is Elon's way of saving money, for better or worse.

Internal email from Elon:

>Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction | My opinion: _this an all about the financial numbers_.

Tesla's stock price is the basis of Elon's current net worth. It is also weird because if you look at Tesla as a _car company_ the stock is way overvalued. Just to focus on one metric (not that it's the best metric or even a good one), look at Tesla's price:earnings ratio compared to other carmakers. Tesla's P:E is over 50; Ford's is 13, Toyota is 10, Honda is 9, General Motors is 5, VW is 4. This suggests that (as a carmaker) Tesla's stock should be around $10 to $20 a share, and ranking Tesla as a carmaker somewhere between Honda and Volvo, probably right on par with Kia. 

Carmakers typically make about 8% to 10% gross margin; it is a tough competitive business, and fairly-well constrained. Technology companies are different, though: Apple's gross margin is 26% and their P:E ratio is around 26, while Alphabet (Google) is 25 and Microsoft's is 34. So Elon's sales pitch has been that Tesla isn't a car company: it's a tech company that makes cars like Apple makes iPhones â€” an in-demand upscale product that commands gross margins of 20% or more. And initially that worked â€” Tesla was the only EV maker in the market, and sold upscale, high-performance cars with good margins.

However, Tesla has missed its revenue targets for the last 3 quarters, and most recently their gross margin was below 6% â€” so as a car company, doing worse than most. It doesn't help that there is now effective competition: today there are plenty of companies are making EVs that are similar to Tesla products. 

So this is all about improving the financial numbers at Tesla. 

Tesla can't increase margins by raising prices: effective competition means that they'll lose sales on price. They've already cut prices to boost sales, but that's what wrecked their margin. So the only thing that is under Elon's immediate control is labor costs â€” so by cutting every job that isn't contributing revenue to the _next_ quarterly report, he'll make the numbers look better. 

However, as a carmaker, this puts Tesla in a bad spot. For an idea of what happens to automakers when the economists fire the engineers, look at what happened to the US auto industry in the 70's and 80's. Decisions in the 60's to reduce R&D, engineering, and production costs led directly to the vehicles of the subsequent decades. So recent cost-cutting moves set up Tesla in the role of the US carmakers of the 70's-80's, and the Chinese EV makers in the role of the Japanese carmakers of the same era. 

Tesla _may_ make the transition from carmaker to tech company, if they can successfully develop and sell AI technology (such as a Level 4 or 5 self-driving system) leveraging their installed base of vehicles. But I wouldn't bet on it. I'd prefer to see Tesla become the Toyota of EV carmakers and the Exxon-Mobil of EV charging. But that would take ongoing R&D, engineering investment, and honestly a solid hit to the stock price. | only elon knows.

but if you try to think like a narcisist..

* the regulation team probably keep telling ""no"" to elon related to robotaxy. so blames them for failure of robotaxi getting approval. thus canning the whole team
* the car design team fails to deliver model 2. maybe it was because C-level people keeps meddling, changing requirements, etc. So obviously, not the fault of C-level people but the fault of the team. can the whole team.
* tesla charge compatibility will no longer be supercharger exclusive. so other companies will build charging capabilities of tesla. thus canning the whole redundant team

Honestly that's it. They're gutting their core business to go all in on something they have a terrible track record on and may never be able to crack. This is a next level example of how to destroy a company we all get to watch in real time.

At the end of the day, Musk really does seem to think Tesla should not be a car company anymore, and he is taking steps to ensure that takes place. As CEO, that's his prerogative. | Massive layoffs to offset revenue against declining sales to protect stock value. 

Bandaid on a broken leg. | Honest answer is nobody outside of Elon who may not even know what he is doing.


Could be mass layoffs followed by restructuring. Could have noticed the workload per employee was too low. Could be a move to boost stock price. Could be any number of reasons. | I'll try to give an answer but I think I'll be downvoted because it would seem I support this decision. I don't.    
- Supercharging has been one of the least profitable business in Tesla. They did mention it many times, they only reason why they did it is because they had to.    We all saw the horrible job that EA, plugshare, etc. this is no different than them making their own batteries.   It was a nice hedge in case the market didn't deliver.   
- As an investor I thought it was the stupidest idea to open the charging network to the competition without additional fees.  This should be their leverage and he should capitalize it but he didn't. Because of whatever crap about accelerating sustainable energy.  
- following this trail of thought, regulators and even the government doesnt like the idea of Tesla having a literal monopoly on superchargers.  For electrification to move to all the corners of the world, Tesla has to become a provider of tech, and governments and the rest of the companies need to take over this expansion.   Can you imagine if all gas stations in the US are all chevron? 
To make a better comparison imagine Nvidia being the provider and the only one that provides cloud services for AI. Which is not the case. They just sell hardware to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and all other cloud providers.   So Tesla will only focus on tech, and allow for other companies to own the electrification of America.
- another redditor posted how insanely difficult is to know regulations in a place like California. Doing that for the whole world is ridiculously inefficient.   Specially when you gotta be the middle man between the utility company, and the owner. The best case scenario is for owners to take over this work. For those of you that did solar panel probably know how insanely difficult and slow this is. | I've read that Elon has a drug problem and a resulting behavioral problem.  His insane actions and comments seem to support those stories.

The Tesla Board of Directors, long ago should have taken steps to protect the shareholders, protect the employees and protect Musk from himself, but they seemingly have done nothing.

It is likely not a character issue but fully a health issue, so no shame in seeking competent medical help, away from work and all other distractions. Just a couple of months under the right care could provide a complete cure and make all the difference.

Until then, the only Tesla thing we will buy is option shorts. | I don't know exactly the scope of the team he let go. But I think there is logic here. If I had to guess:

- other vehicles and charging companies are now adopting NACS as a standard
- with everyone on the same charging standard the Tesla charging advantage over other vehicles will minimize
- fast charging infrastructure may be starting to meet the need in the US
- there will be intense competition for customers between charging companies, and charging prices will be driven downward to a minimum, which is good for consumers but bad for Tesla
- the charging business will decline in profit for Tesla and become ultra-low-margin, like gas stations
- Tesla has run into revenue issues and needs to get leaner, and disinvesting from businesses that don't have strong growth potential is the way forward

Just like Apple doesn't run its own 5G network even though that might help with the overall experience, it may not be in Tesla's interest (or future business model) to run a huge, low-margin EV charging network.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

Is Toyota completely wrecking fast charging right now?,"So I stopped by a 200 kW EVgo station that I visited in the past, which gets me my 20-80% in a clean 20 minutes (25 in cold weather).

The station was all clogged up with bZ4x toyota EVs.  We're in a cold snap, but the fastest charging from those cars was 21 kW.  That's roughly *two hours* for a 20-80% charge.  The Fords and Kias were in and out, but those stalls got replaced by more Toyota bZ4x cars. 

When the DCFC is barely outpacing AC, there's something wrong.  People told me they were waiting 3-4 hours at that EVgo station, and others mentioned they were using the Toyota because they were getting big financial incentives.

Almost feels like Toyota *unwittingly* dropped a poison pill in the CCS charging world.  Absolutely nuts.  I'll just stay off of DCFC for a while and find other ways to trickle charge my car.

(E: Edited first sentence of last paragraph so y'all don't mistake me for a conspiracy theorist)",503,521,1705679953,"There are a lot more Bolts out there than there are BZ4X.

"My first year with an EV, why I am never going back","Last year, after totaling my gas guzzling Mercedes C300, I decided that I was finally going to give the electric car market a chance. I first bought a used 2020 Ford Fusion, which I quite liked, but I only owned it for a few months before my dad totaled his old POS 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis, which he basically drove into the ground. Now, insurance offered him 4000 bucks for this car, but my state, Colorado, offers 6000 for old gas powered cars IF you are planning on using the money to buy a new EV. So, I made my dad an offer he couldn't refuse, I traded him my 2020 Ford Fusion in exchange for 2002 POS. Then I traded the 2002 POS in for my 6000 and started looking for an EV. 



After shopping around quite a bit, I finally settled on the Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE. I have now owned this car for one year, and it has been a delight! It is by the far the nicest car I have ever owned, it is reliable, the ride is smooth and comfortable, it has a large amount of cargo space for a sedan (especially with the back seats folded down), it has acceleration that is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD, and it is a visually striking, unique and beautiful car.



Not only that, it is much cheaper to operate than any other car I have ever owned. I get to drive for the first two years for free, because the car comes with two years of free charging at Electrify America charging stations, but even after that, when I am doing most of my charging at home, I have found that it costs me, on average, about 8 dollars to fully charge my car at home. I usually charge about 4 times a month, so that works out to about 32 dollars a month to drive my car, compared to the roughly 270 dollars a month I was spending on gas for my old Mercedes, or 90 dollars a month with my Ford Fusion. It's not a perfect car, the frunk (front trunk) is so small that it's basically useless, the collision detection system is a bit too sensitive, it beeps at you sometimes even if nothing is in front of you, and the Apple Carplay is basically unusable because if you try to play music with it the sound will keep cutting in and out. Fortunately, if you just use bluetooth this isn't a problem, it's only an issue if you connect via USB. 



The knobs and dials on the dashboard are too small and kind of obnoxious to use, but at least the car has buttons, too many electric cars nowadays have no buttons at all, only a touchscreen. From what I have found, the range is actually slightly better than advertised too, I've been able to get 400 miles of range out of a single charge a few times. Usually I get about 360 to 370. I've taken this thing on multiple roadtrips now, including up into the Rocky Mountains and on back country dirt roads, and I haven't run into any problems. I've even taken it camping with me and found that it is quite a convenient camping car. Trips that would normally cost hundreds of dollars in gas are now basically free with the Electrify America free charging! 



I love that the back seats fold down too, I was able to haul a big vintage teak and jade desk that my father gave me by just shoving it in the trunk, putting the back seats down, and then shoving it up against the front seats. None of the other cars I have owned (all sedans) could have possibly fit this desk in their trunks. The storage space in the Ioniq 6 is impressive, and very convenient. In addition, the price is just right. I only paid 26k, after all the tax credits, rebates, and bonus cash, and I bought the car brand new!



I used all the money I got back from the rebates and whatnot to install solar panels on the roof of my house, and to have a level 2 charger installed in my garage. My above calculations about cost were NOT including the solar panels, so in reality my cost per month is probably even lower than 32 bucks. If I charge at night it costs me about 8 dollars, obviously since it is nighttime I can't use my solar panels but I do get cheaper electricity from Xcel Energy. I also get a 50 dollar bill credit every year if I only charge at night. If, on the other hand, I charge during the day roughly 50% of the electricity would be coming from my solar panels and then 50% would be coming from the grid. However, because of the way Xcel Energy's electricity pricing works, electricity is more expensive during the daytime, it works out to about...6ish dollars per charge. 



My wife, who comes from a country that doesn't really have EVs yet, is absolutely blown away by this car, she thinks it's a futuristic super car! 



That brings me to my next point about this car, and that is the reception I get while driving it. I've been made fun of for pointing this out on Reddit before, but this car really is a status symbol. When I brought it home my neighbors all came out to gawk at it, and my next door neighbor told me that it was ""too nice for the neighborhood, you better put it in the garage"". Lots of people have complimented me on it, and expressed total shock when I tell them what I paid for it (26k). 



Heck, my own family, including my own wife and her family, were in complete shock that I was able to afford this thing, because it does not look like a cheap car. I remember last Thanksgiving everybody had to come out and take a look at it and take a ride in it. Now they all think that I'm doing quite well for myself, better than I'm letting on, and one of my cousins decided he was going to one up me by buying a Cybertruck. A bunch of my relatives are buying EVs now because they feel like they're being left behind. Many of my friends now think I'm rich because of this car, and they're incredibly jealous. One of my friends even said ""Man, I need to get my life together so I can buy one of these!"" when he rode in it for the first time. 



Truth is though, I bought this car not because it is cool (even though it is), but because it would save me money. I was trying to be frugal and lower my monthly expenses as much as humanly possible, and the Ioniq 6 was one of only two EVs that met all my requirements. 



So, after one full year with an EV, I am NEVER going back to ICE cars. The monthly expenses for ICE vehicles are far too much for me to ever consider going back, especially with how much gas prices have risen. My wife is currently getting her learner's permit, she has never driven before, and we are on the hunt for a good electric starter car for her. I'm thinking of getting her a 2021 Hyundai Ioniq 1 Electric. One issue I have noticed in the EV industry is the lack of good starter cars. There are a few, but not as many as I was hoping for. ",500,293,1729053965,"Same here. Never going back to gas.

Buying petroleum at all is essentially supporting the Middle East and foreign powers. (I have no problems with other countries btw). Electricity is right here from home, probably pretty close by. Your neighbours probably have a more viable and stable job with your purchase of an EV. No maintenance of the expensive and dirty type. Let's face it, ICE are very complex machines, probably some the most complex machines around that consumers can use. EVs are simple and I assure anyone that is a good thing. Sure the electronics are complex, but what electronic isn't nowadays? From a technical standpoint these trucks I work are have the exact same complex electronics, probably more due to the transmission. How can that be argued with? | I came up with a analogy for skeptics.  Imagine that I had a regular old gas car and i found a place where I could buy gas for $1/gal less then every other station.  I tell my friends I have a secret place that I know about where gas is a lot cheaper.  They of course want to know about this place, they want the deal... that is what its like driving an electric car.  But some people can't get past it, they think its some left wing conspiracy, mostly trump people.. they can't get past the idea that there is something better.  It happened when we went from horses to gas cars etc. | Acceleration is incredible on EV vs ICE. I really think if they push people to just try driving EV sales will increase drastically. People have no idea before trying it.: | I stand with you. 2 1/2 years of EV ownership and I would be so depressed if I ended up in a guzzler having to stop at gas stations again. ðŸ» | Thanks for sharing your story.

Charger hogs' are ruining the electric vehicle experience. One company is clamping down on bad manners,,493,248,1722810350,"TLDR; Electrify America, one of America's biggest charging companies, is experimenting with a solution to the problem of charger hogs who can make it slow and unpleasant to travel in an EV. At 10 of the busiest EV fast charging stations in California, Electrify America has enacted a strict limit. Once a car's batteries are 85% charged, charging will automatically stop and the driver will be told to unplug and leave or face additional 40-cent-per-minute idle time fees for taking the space. 


Similar to Tesla idle fees but you can't override the 85% limit. They also mention how part of the problem is that many people are new to EVs and resort to their gas car habits and think they need to fill up to 100% | As long as they stick to places where there's another charger in ~100 miles in every conceivable travel direction this is fine by me. 

I would like it better if EA could implement a queuing system and then institute this when it was appropriate. | I hate to say this, but the biggest problem I have is the fucking culture around these chargers how disorganized it is when you're waiting for one and how people get. Specially when you have them all in Walmart parking lot. | I was at my local mall and witnessed a related problem this week. I don't even have an EV. Our mall reserves many of the best/closest parking spots for EVs and has chargers there all in a row. So they're pretty choice spots, location wise. Shortest walk to the stores and restaurants.

Anyway I walk past there after parking my car way in the boonies, and notice half the cars aren't charging. They're not even plugged in but they're using the spots. I think EV drivers just like parking there for convenience. Would annoy the hell out of me if I had an EV I needed to charge. | I'd say a better approach would be to institute a surcharge for going over 85%, that is charged even if you have a free charging plan.  So, the 0-85% range could be the $0.56/kWh, then add a surcharge ($0.50?  $1.00?  some other amount?) for the power delivered after the car hits 85% that gets billed even if you have free charging.  That way, if you absolutely need the additional power, you can still get it, it's just going to cost you.

I had one stretch on my current trip where I charged to 95% and arrived at 3%; if I'd been hard limited to 85%, I couldn't have done the trip using that route. | That's all fine, until you need the entire battery.
Not everyone has 250+ miles on their battery.

Penalizing smaller batteries by basing the surge on percentage doesn't sound like such a good solution. | Last night, I went to an EA station in a mall.  Three of the EV charging spaces were taken up by ICE cars just parked there while shopping.  No enforcement for that and it's much more bothersome than charging hogs. | Various companies in Sweden has solved this issue two ways:

1) If you charge to full, fine. If you overstay with over 30+ minutes you end up paying a hefty hourly charge for being a hog.

2) There are now Cameras in certain places that immediately recognize your car number plate, it will greet you to remind you it knows your number.

Good luck evading that. | How about they add more chargers so everyone who needs one can use it for however long they want and no one has to wait in line | I'm okay with an additional price over 85%. Blatantly kicking someone off I am absolutely not. There are many times on long trips when you need a 90% charge or higher going through a dead zone.

"Electric Vehicles Won't Kill Car Culture, They'll Make It Even Better",,491,194,1716724767,"The issue is that nobody is making bare bones, dumb, mass-produced EVs with huge amounts of interchangeable, modular, rebuildable, parts and inventories.

The above is a key ingredient that fuels modifying, tuning, restoration, and enthusiast scene overall.

This is not an EV only issue. Many new ICE cars have become too expensive to buy / maintain, too feature rich, and seem to focus on appealing to more disposable income buyers, who buy/ lease then dispose of after 5-7 years. Cost of repair on cars has become insane due to expensive parts and lack of modularity. 

Some people like to keep their cars for a long time, others like to buy a beater car and restore it, and others love to tune their cars to a limit. 

This is something you can do when you get a car for cash with 0 commitments and have the freedom to do anything with it at any time, due to an abundance of mechanics, parts, and resources.

Edit: However, retrofitting ev drivetrains in vintage cars that never had a decent or reliable ice drive train is something i hope will become more accessible and easier in the future. It can save some interesting cars from the scrap yard or from being abandoned projects. It also appeals for enthusiasts who want a more 'analog experience, that most modern cars lack. | Maybe we can try out some mass transit, just in case it works too? | Quite a bit of car enthusiasts are still against buying an OEM EV based on one thing, the ability to work on it or modify the vehicle yourself. Unless you know programming languages like C  or C++, and know how to design printed circuit boards, the only things you can change are the wheels, tires, bushings, remove interior weight, or suspension (depending on the vehicle).

This is why I like the Diy EV car scene. You're able to take OEM electric motors, inverters, batteries, etc. and put them in your old gas vehicles of choice. There are different people who are taking OEM EV parts, and essentially remaking logic boards for them to be used in your vehicle of choice. A prime example of that is Arlin Sansomes Honda CRZ powered by a first gen Nissan Leaf motor, and a modified Leaf inverter. He's making over 330 HP from that motor!

I just don't want to live in a place where we're all forced into car dependency. If given the opportunity I'd pick walkable, bikeable cities with great public transit every time. Also, not having to be a millionaire to enjoy those things where they do exist in the US would be great. | I wasn't a car person until I got my EV, actually.

FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes Action to Protect American Workers and Businesses from China's Unfair Trade Practices,,492,502,1715683133,"They keep saying ""artificially low prices""... what does that mean? China's low prices seem very real to me.

We are just reaping what we have sewn. Nixon/Reagan sold out our manufacturing base to let corporations generate more profit at the American worker's expense. Some haphazard panicky tariffs aren't gonna undo decades of bad work | Any one remember when one of Bidens handlers tweeted that tariffs on China were bad? | EVs in USA will become more expensive, further slow down the EV adoption,  and probably will drive some to bankruptcy.. | Election year and the United Auto Workers have endorsed Biden. This is what they want in return. Just democracy at work. | This is the primary source for the China tariff information. Here's what's relevant:

>**Electric Vehicles (EVs)**  
  
The tariff rate on electric vehicles under Section 301 will increase from 25% to 100% in 2024.  
  
With extensive subsidies and non-market practices leading to substantial risks of overcapacity, China's exports of EVs grew by 70% from 2022 to 2023â€”jeopardizing productive investments elsewhere. A 100% tariff rate on EVs will protect American manufacturers from China's unfair trade practices.  
  
This action advances President Biden's vision of ensuring the future of the auto industry will be made in America by American workers. As part of the President's Investing in America agenda, the Administration is incentivizing the development of a robust EV market through business tax credits for manufacturing of batteries and production of critical minerals, consumer tax credits for EV adoption, smart standards, federal investments in EV charging infrastructure, and grants to supply EV and battery manufacturing. The increase in the tariff rate on electric vehicles will protect these investments and jobs from unfairly priced Chinese imports.  
  
**Batteries, Battery Components and Parts, and Critical Minerals**  
  
The tariff rate on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5%% to 25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate on battery parts will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024.  
  
The tariff rate on natural graphite and permanent magnets will increase from zero to 25% in 2026. The tariff rate for certain other critical minerals will increase from zero to 25% in 2024.  
  
Despite rapid and recent progress in U.S. onshoring, China currently controls over 80 percent of certain segments of the EV battery supply chain, particularly upstream nodes such as critical minerals mining, processing, and refining. Concentration of critical minerals mining and refining capacity in China leaves our supply chains vulnerable and our national security and clean energy goals at risk. In order to improve U.S. and global resiliency in these supply chains, President Biden has invested across the U.S. battery supply chain to build a sufficient domestic industrial base. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Defense Production Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested nearly $20 billion in grants and loans to expand domestic production capacity of advanced batteries and battery materials. The Inflation Reduction Act also contains manufacturing tax credits to incentivize investment in battery and battery material production in the United States. The President has also established the American Battery Materials Initiative, which will mobilize an all-of-government approach to secure a dependable, robust supply chain for batteries and their inputs.

And to inject some opinion here - remember that Chinese EV imports don't just potentially affect the ""Detroit Big Three"", they also affect Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru, Hyundai / Kia, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Tesla, Rivian, **and** Lucid, all of whom hire American labor for their US plants. | Unfair trade practices?  Do they mean folding profits back into R&D instead of stock buybacks? | every US auto maker has been bailed out and received subsidies. i am not a china fan, but in this case they did everything right, they invested and built up their ev industry while everyone else was on the fence. i hate this ""yay, free markets!"" when it's convenient nonsense. when the neo liberals ran our jobs off, causing a second wave of income inequality (after the reagan tax cuts) it was free market tough love, now that it's coming back to bite the top 5% it's panic stations.

the only plausible justification for this policy is to preserve what's left of our manufacturing capacity in case of the need to mobilize at scale for a future war. | China has affordable EVs.

And this is why I I hesitated on buying an electric because of what just happened,"EDIT: 

I cannot tell you guys how surprised I am about how many comments this got and I appreciate everyone and their comments and their advice and over half the people telling me should've got a Tesla lol. Had I not gotten as good of a deal on this car as I did, I probably would have. I have made it a point that when I get to 75 miles that I look for a charging station and I have all the apps downloaded now but I'm going to try to stick with EVgo because of the savings I get it.

Also, I made a deal with my landlord. I'm gonna get a home charger too.

Seriously, thanks again. I really appreciate the advice.

First I drive for Uber. I had a trip that took me to within 25 miles before my battery was dead. I found a charging station 15 miles away so no big deal. It was an EVgo station I get there and EV goes network is completely down for an update. I wait and then I call back when it's supposed to be done and they screwed the update for the system and it's now completely down until further notice. Then at that point I had 7 miles left so I drove 5 miles to a target for a charge point and that station is under maintenance and it wasn't reported. 

Now I have 2 miles left so I drive a mile and a half to a movie theater that has the chargers in the parking lot which was the only other place I could go and these don't turn on for another 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, I passed at least a half dozen gas stations. 

I absolutely love the car. I cannot stand the infrastructure. Manufacturers whip out cars without even thinking about how people were going to charge them on the road. Neither did our stupid government. 

It is so frustrating, but they've got to get this shit together. There needs to be more charging stations",485,588,1724235712,"Your rant is valid, stranded uber person | And getting into politics: the fact this country has this infighting is fucking ridiculous and childish. | Meanwhile, Tesla owners have no idea how often this happens because the Supercharger network is just everywhere and has like 99% uptime. I just WISH the rest of the EV charger companies took their jobs building our infrastructure as seriously. | Similar issue, my larger concern is there just not being enough. On a recent drive between Boston and Montreal the charging turned out to be a huge headache, not because there arnt any working ones (there's actually around 20ish, and their all very reliable) but because there just simply isn't enough stalls. Apart from 1 EA station halfway and a sprinkling of Flo units, every single charger on the American side is a 1-2 stall station of Chargepoint units that can at most do 75kw, half that on ones which power share (which is all of them). And given that this is a very heavily traveled corridor, they're ALWAYS full. Every single one we went to we ended up having to wait for for a while or just go to the next one, because there'd either be a line of 3-5 people in line for the single stall or there'd be another person in the next stall and I just skipped it for the next one because im not waiting 120 min just to get to 80% | Unfortunately with the current infrastructure i do not go anywhere without at least one back up plan. | I don't understand why gas stations don't all also have EV charging options, especially the ones that lean hard into also being a food destination. | I am a huge EV advocate but would never advocate buying one if you can't charge at home or at work.

As a Lyft driver, I can say it's AWESOME having a gas station at my house. | Home charging is the only thing keeping non-Tesla EVs afloat. The NACS integration can't come soon enough. And even that is going to be problematic when all cars are using up stations. | Gas got a 100 year head start. EV charging needs to do 100 years of progress in 10 years. | This frustration with the CCS charge networks is being addressed, the industry is switching to Tesla (NACS) charging. There are 2x as many Tesla chargers as CCS, and they are far more reliable (99% available vs 75%) and performant (all 150 kW or faster). On the plus' side, all the OEMs are providing adapters this year so their customers can access Tesla chargers, so your EV situation should get a lot better once you can access 3x as many chargers.

On top of that the government funded (NEVI) more chargers a few years ago, but it's being done through the states, so it's a slow process, each state had to decide how they were going to award the funding, collect proposals, approve them, fund them, etc., so only a few projects have made it all the way to deployed chargers so far, but many more are coming.

The wait lists here in Canada were long, so I decided to purchase almost 2 years ago, and honestly didn't have a strong handle on how the costs would work out.  I knew I was paying a premium, but I didn't know how charging would work for me, how viable home charging would be, what maintenance costs would be. I didn't know anyone in my personal life who had an EV. I was buying a bit on faith and hunch, but I figure even if the cost and convenience wasn't quite there, I was happy to chalk up the difference to being my contribution to a better environment.

I did know that my commute patterns was ideal for EV. Larger distance mainly on highway, and that if I had a hybrid, I'd probably be burning gas for most of it.

6 months in, I've probably saved over $1000 in gas, enough that it's paid for the home charger and installation. My home charging costs are almost non existent due to overnight time of use rates here.

Unless something drastically changes with my driving patterns or with charging costs, I'll probably have saved enough to pay whatever premium I paid on the car in four or five years l. And given that gas just jumped in price, the value is getting better, not worse.

Chinese domination of the global lithium and graphite supply chain is a major geopolitical and economic risk to the US â€” ***Joe Manchin is and was right about that the entire time***. The clauses he demanded have successfully driven onshoring of US-made packs and batteries, and more or less have stopped dead in the water the funneling of US subsidies to Chinese corporations.

These sorts of limits are in moving towards being in place even outside of the US â€” France is [now nixing EV subsidies on Chinese cars](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/sixty-five-percent-electric-cars-sold-france-can-quality-state-bonus-scheme-2023-12-14/), and the [EU battery passport regulations](https://www.circularise.com/blogs/eu-battery-passport-regulation-requirements) are designed to eventually enable the exact same thing across the entire continent.

We're just entering the [Trough of Disillusionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle), that's all. All the enthusiasts who assumed EVs were a blindly obvious panacea technology that would fix everything instantly are finding out there's a whole world of nuance. Some countries don't have money for EV charging infrastructure, some populations are resistant to change, and large consumer subsidies have been masking natural demand curves this entire time. | ![gif](giphy|h1QI7dgjZUJO60nu2X|downsized) | Every week there is at least one of these conspiracy theories about ""Big Oil"" or nefarious republicans, or some other thing that is not true.  BEV proponents need a different tact in advocating for BEVs.  The issues people are talking about regarding BEVs are true, it's not not FUD.  The issues have to be addressed and can no longer be conveniently tied to conspiracy theories that are not true.  Here are three valid issues that need addressing:

1) charging infrastructure for people who do not have a garage or place to charge over night.  These people are expecting 400 miles range in 3 minutes with entry prices at $25k.  This is the target for BEVs without subsidies.  Must be addressed if you want mass adoption.

2) Cannot lose up to 40% of range when temperatures are below zero and car must sit out overnight not plugged in. This issue compounds onto issue #1.  If you go to sleep with 100 miles of range and your car sits for 8 hours in below zero temps with no plug, you need to have 100 miles of range in the morning.

3)  Cannot source majority of raw materials through China who is depending on coal, natural gas, and oil to mine, transport, process, and transport again the raw materials necessary to make lithium ion batteries.   Raw materials need to be US sourced with no fossil fuels in the supply chain.

Start with those three issues being real and get the conspiracy theories out of your head.  Oil demand is not currently impacted by BEV adoption.  Only COVID caused the first real drop in oil demand and we are back above pre-covid levels.  BEVs have been subsidized for over 10 years and have had no material impact on reduced fossil fuel consumption at large.  Address the three issues listed above and do not dismiss them as FUD. There is no boogy man hell bent on stopping BEV sales.  Just those three issues to start.  Pretending they're FUD won't help mass adoption. | Early adopters have already purchased their EV's.

Hopped into a few EVs over the last few years but this one is special. (2025 Taycan),"Picked up a 2025 Porsche Taycan in Volcano Gray on a great CPO deal a month or so ago as this was just a dealer test car. It had 1500 miles and was marked down a good 25k-26k. Got it wrapped with PWF Tizzy Teal to pop a bit more. 

I've owned quite a few EVs in the past few years but somehow always knew the Taycan would be end game for me. I was just waiting on the refresh/J1.2 with the larger batteries and faster charging. I tend to roadtrip a bunch and was excited for it. 

I've owned in the past a Chevy Bolt EUV, Mustang Mach-E Premium AWD, Genesis GV60 Performance, Audi e-tron GT, Lucid Air GT and now this. 

I'm sure many are probably going to You had the same car with the e-tron GT but I was so frustrated with Audi MMI and other small things like weird noises from the cabin to dealer issues. I can accurately say the software in the refreshed Taycan is way less laggy and easier to navigate. 

I've already done a few trips to Vegas in this from SoCal and it's been great!

Some of my fave things and some of my negatives

1) It drives like a dream. Nothing handles like a Porsche and this just feels so incredibly smooth. 

2) I'm really loving the Porsche planning on the software with this refresh. I actually had a loaner Taycan GTS for a few days and the software has more options in things like Innodrive, on the driver display, and more. It also is far less laggy! They fixed up a lot from the prior generation. 

3) The range is perfect. I had a Lucid Air GT and while that range was better, I also think I didn't need that much especially on roadtrips. My bladder would want stops. Currently my Taycan gets about 330 miles of range and I drive fairly aggressive on highways going about 75+ minimum. Separately the Lucid never learned your driving habits and gave an accurate number of range remaining. It would always charge to 100% and be at 502 miles. Drove me nuts. 

4) Charging speeds is wow on this Taycan. This ties back to #3 but because while I may need to charge more often than the Lucid, it would be quick top-ups. I've seen 300-320kW charging hold until 65%ish and even when it did drop it would fall to 270kW until about 75%. I've seen it do faster than advertised speeds at 10-80% in 15 minutes as opposed to 18.  Also one thing that frustrated me about my Lucid was the charging curve so I'm thrilled this one is rock solid. 

5) The looks. It's sexy. Sexiest EV on the market. I think the e-tron GT is also up there as well. 

6) Features like Innodrive are actually not too bad. Heard some horror stories about it but I think the refresh on software helped. Also regen braking also isn't as bad as I expected. They updated them in the newer ones where you can have it on by default and it does a good job using cameras for Auto Regen on cars in front of you. 

7) Other extras: Being able to watch movies and shows via infotainment is nice. Not the best interface but still good. And I have the passenger display that's on and blocked for me as a driver so my partner can watch movies on roadtrips! Also the new Taycan comes with more standard options like soft closed doors and heads up display. Really appreciate that over the last gen. 

Things that could be better

1) I will miss the more frequent software updates I got from manufacturers like Ford or Lucid. But sometimes they were still infrequent and a bit lackluster. 

2) Innodrive and its steering wheel nag is a bit excessive! Like every 10 seconds. 

3) It has an electric motor noise option. I like it! But I hate how it has to be turned on each time I get in the car. 

4) The steering wheel controls were updated for 2025 so you can now have a skip back track button and a reprogrammable button. Before it was just a reprogrammable button that was defaulted as a skip back track button. You have to make the reprogrammable button skip forward track or else you're a psycho. I dunno how they don't have these two buttons just on the wheel by default. 

5) Wish it had a bit more room in the trunk. Have had some struggles getting used to that. 

6) I wish Porsche would just make the Taycan frunk automatic opening like Lucid or an option for it. 


Beyond that it has been great. Fairly sure I'm missing some stuff. But wanted to share my experience!

Tesla's profits are now coming from things Elon Musk said he wouldn't do | Electrek,,476,213,1729876910,"So they're making extra money on charging, probably from non-Tesla cars. | I have no problem pointing out Tesla's BS when applicable. Even as an owner. But I don't think it's applicable here. 

'Service' is vastly different than 'Services'. It's apples and oranges. 

One refers to the vehicle undergoing service/maintenance, the other refers to that... plus every extra service offered. 

As they said, supercharger use, merch sales, online store, parts, etc. Likely software add-ons like acceleration boost and premium connectivity. 

At the end of the day? The overwhelming majority of Tesla's on the road are still firmly covered under factory warranties excluding battery/drivetrain. They must be EATING costs fixing all the little things every day. The profit isn't coming from wheel replacements and road damage.

Notice how they specifically call out gross profit generation on supercharging, parts sales, and merchandise. Yet they only claim Margin Improvement on service center work.

Services and Other had a Revenue of $2.790M, but a cost of 2.544M. That means Services and Other only had a profit of $246M. Just under 9% profit. If they were making a profit on vehicle service as well, they likely would have much more profit. | On what car base?  As the number of Tesla's on the road increases services revenue would also increase without expansion of margin.

"GM teases next-gen Chevy Bolt EV: faster charging, multiple models [The Verge]",,481,196,1728415696,">In terms of price, Reuss said we could expect a slightly more expensive next-gen Bolt than the Bolt EUV, which starts at $28,795. And it will just be one member of a family of Bolts, including an even lower cost option, he said. 

>The 2026 Bolt will offer the same value as the original Bolt and much more, and it will be a moneymaker for us, Reuss said. Think about that.

>It's already been revealed that GM won't be bringing over the original hatchback Bolt to the automaker's Ultium platform, just the larger Bolt EUV. Without the hatchback, it remains to be seen which segment the next-gen low-cost Bolt will occupy.

Prediction: It will be slightly larger than the original Bolt EUV and while the LT model will be more expensive than the Bolt EUV, it will still end up under $30,000 to start. Then in a year or so they'll slightly increase the price on the LT and bring in an LS model.

Because Ford is still not all-in on EVs.

That's different than GM, which has been pushing much more strongly into this space.

I feel like the article is a bit hyperbolic at points, but otherwise and am glad Hyundia and Kia are still moving forward with good EVs. | There are a lot of big manufacturers that should be embarrassed by this development. | Hyundai and Kia are doing what every other auto maker should do - they are looking at what sells for them, and are making viable electric alternatives in those segments.

Toyota? Their top sellers (last I checked) were the RAV4 and Camry. Their EV? Not even close to those two. Hell, they didn't even think to make a fully electric Prius.

Ford? F-Series, Explorer, then Transit.

Electrifying the F-series I get. However, truck owners are very anti-EV so this wouldn't have been one of the first two things I'd electrify. The Mach-E? Great vehicle done in by its name. The ""it's not a Mustang!"" crowd won't touch it. And we have a friend who won't even give it a chance because, ""but it's a Mustang and I just want a crossover!""

Ford should have taken the Escape, Edge, Explorer, and Bronco, and electrified two of them to start. Exactly like what GM has realized and has begun with the Blazer and Equinox.

Then there's Mercedes, Genesis, Mazda, Subaru, and Toyota (again!), who's entire business plan with regards to EVs seems to be ""how can we make sure that this does not appeal to our existing customer base?"" That way they can act all shocked that they don't sell. Don't get me wrong, some of them (Mercedes, Genesis) are good vehicles, electric or otherwise. But they don't look like the brand's existing vehicles. Auto buyers tend to be the most brand loyal of any market segment. So when a Mercedes S-Class owner realizes that [THIS (Doug voice)](https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/class/eqs/sedan) does not look like [THIS](https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/class/s-class/sedan), they get kind of turned off by it.

Each brand has an identity. And when they make an electric vehicle that doesn't align with the overall brand identity (I'm looking at you, BWM i3), it just makes it look like the company doesn't give a damn about EVs. So I like seeing companies like Hyundai/Kia as well as Volvo and GM having success in the EV space because their EVs take design queues from or are outright replicas of their existing vehicles.

***

To clarify the above, the Genesis GV70 EV looks like the ICE version. My issue with Genesis is that their top seller, the G80, is a sedan. Their entire identity is sedans, only recently moving into the crossover/SUV space due to that being the growing segment. But make no mistake, Genesis buyers and fans identify primarily with their sedans. And to not start with a fully electric sedan for that company, IMO, was a mistake. | I've been a Kia buyer since 2009 when I bought the new at the time Kia Soul.  I loved that car.

Then went to a 2014 Kia Sorento.  Again another great car.  GDI engine burned oil though so there was that.  I had to put a quart of oil in every month or two.  No leaks, it just burned it and repair shops all said to just live with it because it's not worth fixing.

"GOP-led states sue to block U.S. emissions rules for cars, light trucks",,469,154,1713468695,"If anyone is still questioning why the United States is lagging behind in the transition... This is why.

>Republican attorneys general from 25 states on Thursday sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to block rules intended to reduce planet-warming emissions from cars and light trucks and encourage electric vehicle manufacturing, arguing the agency exceeded its legal authority.

>The lawsuit challenging the regulations for passenger vehicles, finalized on March 20 by President Joe Biden's administration, was filed by attorneys general from states led by Kentucky and West Virginia in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

>The EPA rules aim to cut fleetwide tailpipe emissions for cars and light trucks by nearly 50% over 2026 levels in 2032, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7.2 billion tons through 2055.

>Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said the rules would harm the American economy, threaten jobs and raise prices while undermining the U.S. electricity grid. Coleman also said there is very little consumer interest in electric vehicles in his state.

>Republican state officials have said the rules amount to an attempt by the administration to transform the American passenger vehicle market improperly through strict rules that make it difficult for manufacturers to not go electric.

>""The Biden administration is willing to sacrifice the American auto industry and its workers in service of its radical green agenda. We just aren't buying it,"" Coleman said.

>West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey called the rules ""legally flawed and unrealistic, to say the least.""

>The EPA declined to comment.

>The regulations are among the most significant environmental rules implemented under Biden, who has made tackling climate change a key pillar of his presidency. The EPA has forecast that between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would be electric under the rules  a range that reflected the flexibility the agency has said automakers have to pursue different pollution-cutting technologies.

>Republican state attorneys general during the public comment period before the rules were finalized had said that they go well beyond the EPA's authority under the landmark anti-pollution law called the Clean Air Act, and amount to a ""top-to-bottom attempt to restructure the automobile industry.""

>After resistance by autoworkers and the auto industry, the final version of the regulations was scaled back compared to an earlier proposal in order to give automakers more flexibility in meeting the emissions reduction goals. The EPA gave automakers more freedom to meet emissions standards with gas-electric hybrids, which many environmentalists have opposed as a half-measure that delays the EV transition.

>The EPA said the final rule cuts emissions by 49% by 2032 over 2026 levels compared with 56% under its previous plan. EPA chief Michael Regan said the rule impose ""absolutely no mandate"" on manufacturers to adopt electric vehicles.

>**Other states that joined the suit included: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.**

>The EPA on March 29 separately said it was finalizing tighter tailpipe emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles like semi-trucks and buses, but those regulations were not part of the lawsuit.

>The lawsuit is the latest example of Republican attorneys general turning to the courts to challenge various aspects of the Biden administration's climate agenda.

>Republican-led states also have challenged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's corporate climate disclosure rules, the U.S. Energy Department's pause on approvals for new liquefied natural gas export facilities and EPA rules toughening standards for air pollution, among other things.

Amazing | [removed] | Did you ever wonder why the US now has almost exclusively large vehicles? It is a result of unintended consequences. EPA emissions rules are written in such a way that larger vehicles can have more lenient regulations. Because of this, coups and sedans are almost non existent in the US market even though they have less overall emissions.

Some might say, ""Naw people just like big cars!"" However the problem is that it is hard to know the truth because auto companies and dealers only market the larger more expensive cars because they are incentivized to do so.

Range anxiety is real,"On our way back from Toronto, we charged our car in New York. Our home is 185 miles from the charging station and I thought with a 10% buffer, I should be okay with 205 miles and stopped at around 90% charge.

Ultimately, I drove the last 50 miles slightly below the speed limit (there was no good charger along the way without a 20 minutes detour). This would not have happened in a gas car.

Once you get used to it, it's easy to guestimate 'worst case scenario'.

- ambient interior lighting
- less info displayed on cluster/very spartan minimalist look to the cluster

*Put it this way, I don't think anybody's making money on $25,000 vehicles in the U.S., regardless of drive type. It's just not happening.*

Something feels ""broken"" to me if nobody can make any money selling a $25k car of any kind (not just EVs) | Once I have the scratch, I'm buying a beater pickup and retrofitting it with Edison Motors' kit.

That'll be less than $25k all in. | I enjoyed the read even though I think it is wrong from top to bottom. First the primary duty of a company is to remain a going concern. That means you optimize, not maximize profits. But I digress.

Honda sells 200K Civics per year and that's a $25K car. Volumes are going down but Kia's Elantra seems to taking Civic market share.

Since in the real world people do want to sell you cars for $25K or less, and EVs are simpler/cheaper machines, those people will love to sell you a $25K EV as soon as they can. So the title of the piece is just plain wrong on the facts.

Pushevs, https://pushevs.com/2024/08/06/price-of-ev-battery-cells-continues-to-fall-in-china/, has battery packs running at $58/kWh for LFP. That's $3K for a 50 kWh pack or 200-250 miles of real world range.

Even in the tariff barrier protected EV market we are seeing crashing EV pricing in disguise: on the lease front you see cheap leases based on $10K of lease cash and insanely high residual valuations at lease end; on the buying front $18K in incentives at the top end and $10-12K for the rest is a de facto price cut.

Elon Musk might give up on Tesla's 4680 battery cell by the end of the year,,460,331,1721231289,"It's been a flop so far. 

Heavily hyped, but none of the advantages have materialized yet. 

No range, no density, no cost reduction has made it to customers. | Oh man. If I could go back to all the comments from users downvoting me and claiming this was going to be a magical like revolution of not just cars but semis and energy storage. | By 2018 you'll be able to summon your Tesla from across the country. | It's interesting that Rivian is pivoting to a similar form factor for the R2. 4695 i think is what they presented. Odd if it's really been a failure. | It did its job, which was to pump the stock so Elon could meet his comp requirements. Now dump it and let's move on. | I'm really confused... 4680... is just a battery size lol | I sure hope this doesn't also include a cancelling of the ~~spice~~ lithium harvesters program that definitely wasn't just an idea they came up with after watching Dune or playing C&C, with no real R&D performed or real consideration for whether it was actually possible.  But it sure made for some amazing stagecraft... (ie yet another Elon lie)

Did Tesla ever announce helicopters that could latch onto the harvesters and pick them up in case of a sandworm attack?  Now that would have been really cool and really innovative, because no one's ever thought of that idea.... especially not that hack Frank Herbert. | It think Elon said they will achieve cost parity with other cell manufacturers by end of this year, so I am assuming this article is saying that if they can't do that, then they shouldn't continue with it, but its only beneficially to invest in their own battery tech for eventual cost savings. | Its funny how an entirely speculative statement is setting off so many people here on a ""told ya so"" tirade. Not a fan of musk myself, but maybe don't count your chickens before they've hatched. | This has to be one of the worst interpretations of the email possible lol.

> In May, Musk told the team working on the 4680â€”the nickname for the cylindrical battery, which is 46 millimeters in diameter and 80 millimeters tallâ€”to cut its cost and scale up one of its key innovations by the end of the year, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. And in recent months, Musk has told them he wants to see a solution to a thorny technical problem that can cause the batteries to collapse on themselves while in use, one of those people said.

How do you extrapolate ""or else I'll cancel the project"" from that? To me given Musks history, I'd extrapolate ""or you are fired"" from that WAY before I'd extrapolate or the project is cancelled. But even more than that it literally is just him laying out the goals he wants the team to hit lol. Imagine anytime you are at work and your boss set a timeline of work that needed to be completed and some random newspaper wrote an article about it claiming if it's not acomplished it means its cancelled lol. Imagine if Musk did that with SpaceX - oh hey we didn't complete CrewDragon vehicle on the timeline we wanted, so we're cancelling it and returning the money to NASA.

Cities Are Switching to Electric Vehicles Faster Than Individuals,,465,136,1716495952,"they are more likely to be doing TCO calculations, and EVs are coming out on top. | That makes sense. City employees generally don't drive that far away from their charger, the cars need less maintenance, the cities can close their USTs, and the cities cycle through vehicles in a regular period anyway. | I learned from a friend who happens to be on the police force in my town that all the police vehicles are now hybrids, and that the town had been spending tens of thousands of dollars on gas prior to the switch. The larger the scale and the more carefully you study your budget, the easier the choice becomes. Governments are also probably pretty ruthless about dumping vehicles the moment they need too much maintenance. | Cities see the benefits of lower operating cost.

A similar example.  Stats show that USPS Vehicles that deliver mail travel extremely predictable, often low-speed routes and average only 20 miles per day.   Of course the GOP forced USPS to replace their truck with ones that got WORSE gas mileage (from a GOP crony) instead of buying EVs, but Biden has started to reverse that. | I mean as a nation we jumped onto leds because of electrical waste | Not to much of a surprise:

- Cities have boarders. Going to be rare for their vehicles to have to travel 1000's of km's

- Cities generally operate fleets.  Need to make that above 1000km trip for some reason? - just take a combustion engine pool car.

Took delivery of my BYD Seal today. They even popped a bow on it to apologise for a four day delay.,,458,327,1729448408,"I absolutely love the exterior and color. Not feeling the interior. I'd like to see how they drive. | Wow, love the styling. Very sleek! Looks great in that color, too. | Traded in my 71 plate Kia EV6 for a BYD Seal ""Excellence"" (aka Performance). BYD is a very unknown entity in the UK so I've already had someone state (jokingly) that I've bought an ""off brand"" car. The offer was something I couldn't refuse: Â£0 down, Â£2,200 retailer discount and only 1% APR on a four year contract.

Whilst I loved and will miss my EV6, it's nice to be in a properly low slung car again, and it's even better being something so powerful (a whopping 390kW / 523hp) that makes my old S550 Mustang GT's 421hp look like a practice mode. Loads of reviews called the ""3.8S"" badge on the boot-lid ""naff"", but I love how silly it is and how it's the only indication that it's the performance model.

It's still day one, and I've not yet had my phone-app account set-up by BYD, but the 50 miles I've driven today and the in-car systems have been flawless (touch wood); the only issue is Wireless Android Auto isn't working, but there *is* a problem with my particular brand of phone (Xiaomi) on any car's system, so for now it's wired.

The only negative right off the bat is the unit of measurement for efficiency (kWh per 100 miles); I wish manufacturers would all settle on the distance per kWh.

The at-a-glance specs are:

* 82.5kWh LFP battery (usable)
* 390kW dual motor
   * AC permanent magnet synchronous motor (rear)
   * Squirrel cage induction (front)

Unsurprisingly, North America will only be getting the Sportback (and not the Avant), at least at launch, in A6 RWD, A6 AWD, and S6 AWD versions. No EPA ranges announced yet. Pre-orders starting in September globally, no North American pricing yet.

While I am appropriately bummed that the US isn't getting the Avant (yet), the fact that the A6 is now a Sportback instead of a sedan is still pretty good. Though both cars look somewhat frumpy in their proportions. | Yes, the range figure is WLTP, but it's what they've announced at the moment | 466 mile range isn't on EPA cycle, but the wlpt cycle. We'd lose about 80 or so miles. Still very impressive. | Oh my finally a low Audi sedan/stationthat is not the uber expensive E-tron GT. Awesome! | RS6 eTron when? Take my money if it happens | Looks absolutely stunning and the specifications are nothing to sniff at, but at nearly (estimated) *Â£20,000* over the outgoing combustion A6 Avant it's a hard pass from me.

I get that switching to an electric architecture with a big battery is still quite expensive versus slamming in a Diesel engine, but *Â£20,000* feels like there's a badge-snob tax involved and they're taking the piss (the same applied to it's direct competitor, the BMW i5, which was a price increase of Â£17,000).

I'm sure they'll sell a tonne of them, but at these prices they've just priced out the typical A6 buyer.

EV sales aren't 'lagging'  they're headed for long-term growth,,455,128,1718248790,"The biggest takeaway from this, especially if you are a legacy automaker, is ""ICE vehicle sales peaked in 2017"". A smart legacy automaker would not lift their foot from the accelerator on EV's just because the pace of EV growth has slowed from before because EV's continue to grow while ICE volumes continue to decline. ICE vehicles will increasingly be less and less profitable as economies of scale shift towards EV's. If you aren't competitive with EV's, someone else will take a greater share of a growing market and you are left to fight for scraps of a smaller market. | In my opinion the future of electric vehicles is looking fantastic.

We continue to progress on the engineering and technological side of things.  Battery life, battery range, battery weight, and so forth all keep improving.

The charging infrastructure will continue to grow and improve in quality.  We may even see some very interesting and innovative things in this space in the next decade.

A lot of the automakers have more affordable vehicles on the horizon.  Even outside of the affordable dimension we have some very interesting models in general coming out.

I am a bit of an optimist but it just seems everything is looking very positive when you take a long view of things.

If I remember correctly the average vehicle is held for around 13 years now.

I have a feeling in 13 years the percentage of new vehicles being sold that are battery electric is going to be quite high. | The thing is, media beholden to the oil corporations had to push their narrative that electric cars,are failing because they said so 4 5 years ago, and ev sales goes from strength to strength. 
But the most important is not being said even by ev enthusiast.  In one year, the likes of CATL has slashed the price of its batteries in half. We are around 50 60 USD per kwh. This is five years on advance to prediction. At this price, we will soon see electric cars at price parity or close. This is a wave nothing can stop. You would need oil barrel to go back to 20 usd. | I can't wait to buy an EV. For me, it's just a matter of deciding on model and deal. I asked the Volvo dealership if they had any rebates since they don't qualify for the $7,500 tax credit and they said no because they can't keep them on the lot, so why would they offer rebates? | News about future of electric cars are so gloom and doom, that makes me wonder if I fall for hyped bubble, but then I remind myself EV is best car I ever owned and all problems that they are pointing out are false in my actual experience owning and using EV. I wish Europe would put same tax on all ICEs as they will put on Chinese EVs. | Its like this.   You step on the accelerator in you car and you go from 0-30 in 2 seconds.  You keep your foot on the pedal and the car goes from 30-60 in another 3 seconds.  Your passenger looks at you and asks, ""why are you slowing down?"".

The real shortage in the US is level 2 chargers not level 3.,"I've had an electric car now since 2021. Initially charging at destinations such as parking garages, malls, hotels etc was very easy. A major part of that was the pandemic but quite frankly we had significantly less EVs on the road. Now its much more difficult to find open LV2 charging spots available. For the majority of drivers more lv2 parking would make the biggest difference.",456,351,1705668253,"A big use I have for public LV2 chargers is when I drive to a far destination to do an activity that takes many hours, things like hiking, concerts, & sporting events. DCFC charge too fast to leave my car so I'd be big fan if stadium parking garages, trailheads, park and rides, etc. had more LV2. | Free L2 as an amenity has shaped my shopping habits quite a bit, at least before we had L2 at home. Back when I was charging on L1 it was great to be able to go to the store and still come out net positive on range, especially in cold weather. | Here in California, charging at home can top 40 cents per kWh. Free level 2 charging (6.2kW) at my dog park alone has saved me over $250 a year.

Getting a 10-20 mile top up where I stop for an hour or two sure is nice!

Charging is something one does while doing something else. Doesn't really matter if it's sleeping, shopping, eating or whatever. The more spots one can do it, the better! | Yeah, I've honestly never had problems finding dc charging on trips. 

It's when I'm running around, doing errands, shopping, etc that I feel it would be nice to top up a little. 

I do have one problem with free level 2 charging. If it's free, people will hog it. I think you should have to tap your card to start charging. Sure, make it free for an hour then charge like $1 an hour. That'll cover the cost to charge and be just enough to discourage people from sitting there for hours on end. 

A lot of level 2 plugs around me are free, and always full. They always have the same cars sitting at them, employees who get to top up all day every day for free. Generally people who got an EV just because they can charge at work for free, and likely don't have a plug at home to charge. So, they tie up public charging and use it as their own personal charger. 

Adding a small idle fee will combat this. 

But yes, we really need more level 2 plugs. We could also use actual punishments for ice cars that take EV charging spots. | Those installing L2 chargers need to do more to stop them from being abused. I've seen vehicles left on level 2 chargers at a shopping center for 12+ hours. They need time cutoffs or idle fees so that they're actually available for people who are patronizing the destination that put in charging. | EV adoption could take off and be less difficult it multidwellings installed L2 charging in their lots and garages.    
Not just one or two, but enough for each unit to have one. | We specifically need more L2 chargers for rental housing, which will in turn reduce demand at urban L3 locations (which seem to always be insanely crowded).  I'm a landlord and am going to install an L2 charger at my rental property in the near future, thanks to some state incentives.  My current tenant doesn't have an EV, but I think having a charger as an amenity will desirable to future tenants. | They're both needed but for different reasons. Public L2 charging makes sense for those that can't charge at home or at work. If these chargers are everywhere, then every time they leave home they can build up a charge wherever they go. 

DC fast chargers are needed for road trips. And we're going to need a lot more to support these are people continue to switch to EVs. Right now we're at the stage where these are strategically placed to allow road trips, but these little 4 or 8 stall stations every 50 miles isn't going to cut it when 20% of the cars on the road are EVs.

L2 also makes sense for the road trip scenario too but for the overnight hotel stays. Leaving the hotel at 100% lets you avoid one charging stop the next day. Not huge but it gets you another 30 minutes of moving down the freeway. | The building I manage is doing its part.  In November 2022 we installed 18 Lvl 2 chargers (Tesla brand), 9 NACS and 9 CCS.  We believe we are future-proofed with 18 available charger spots.  This is more than any other downtown office building parking garage in Houston I am aware of off the top of my head.

Just a friendly reminder not to only consider hotels, but also look for office parking garages at a destination.  We are in the thick of downtown Houston walkable to many, many popular destinations, and our weekend and daily parking rates are extremely reasonable, with prime parking for EVs (first come-first serve unlimited on the weekends and evenings) and charging available at $0.30 per kWh.  It's cheaper to park in our covered garage than any surface lot or any hotel, etc. | In the southeast, a lot of places kind of greenwashed a bit in the early days. WE SUPPORT EVS, WATCH OUR RIBBON CUTTING AND HANDSHAKE CEREMONY! And then they sat there unused most of the time. 

When that changed, they didn't really adapt, and now we have places where there isn't nearly enough capacity. You are right, though. It'd solve a lot of problems for renters too.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

That's compared to 1,530 gasoline-powered vehicles and 3,475 hybrid vehicles for every 100,000 sold.

  
Once again showing EV's are pretty damn safe | So this is a bit of a tap dance. 

Yes, EV fires are less frequent than ICE fires. 

Yes, EV fires use similar tactics and equipment to ICE fires. 

No, they don't behave the same. 

EV fires don't have running fuel fire problems, that's kinda nice. Those can be a pain if there's any slope to the ground. 

Here's where it gets weird:

The runoff and smoke plume from EV is more toxic to deal with compared to ICE, especially if the battery pack goes into a large scale runaway, such as if it took the responding crew a little bit of time to get there. This is currently being investigated by a few researchers. 

There is no known tool to chemically interrupt or smother the fire once in the battery, as most battery technology can self sustain in the burning process, generating the oxygen it needs on its own. 

An EV needs to sit alone and with space around it for 30 days after the fire due to preignition potential. This was thought to be 3 days, then 7, then 14 in previous guidance and subsequently went up due to actual incidents in storage yards. 

Let's be accurate. EV fires are a more complex problem, but not outside the scope of any typical fire agency. A little training and some changes in tactics aren't difficult, but these do pose a variation on the problem from ICE vehicle fires.

Still way safer than a gas powered car statistically but I don't want that risk and I'm fine with a bit less range. | Fire risk definitely lower than battery pack failure risk of 2-5% (higher as the battery ages).

Ford for example backed off because they saw sells increases were less than first projected and that more of a total market share not just their dealerships being a pain in the ass.

Personally, I think there is going to be a major rebound in about 5-7 years after the infrastructure starts becoming more pervasive and we get better at supporting it.

Ford to idle F-150 Lightning EV plant in Dearborn for weeks,,445,187,1730384070,"This is Ford's own doing. They advertised the truck for $40,000 at launch, so people put down deposits like crazy and Ford ramped up production to meet the expected demand.

When Ford decided they're actually going to sell the truck for $60,000-$100,000, people balked and Ford was left holding an empty bag. | Buy a 2023 model in 2025 | Ford Lightning sales are up over 100% since Q3 last year. The ICE RAM trucks are down 19% every quarter this year compared to last year. Idling the Ford Lightning plant could be due to declining demand or could be upgrades to the factory or the truck itself.

[Q1 and Q2 2024](https://tfltruck.com/2024/07/ford-f-series-ram-trucks-sales-decline-significantly-1st-half-2024-truck-sales-report/)

Industry wide the full-sized truck market sales are decreasing. The vehicles are too large for many but more importantly the higher interest rates are decreasing demand. Industry trends are 10-15% off MSRP for full sized trucks right now.

Edit: Ford needs to get their sales up on Lightning to be profitable. Tesla did report that they are already profiting off of their Cybertruck but Ford still can't find a way to make a profit on EV's? 

""In contrast to Tesla's 16,692 deliveries of the Cybertruck, the Ford F-150 Lightning had only 7,162 deliveries in the 3rd quarter and the Chevrolet Silverado EV had a mere 1,995 deliveries. The Rivian R1T had only 3,817 deliveries."" | Maybe they should have gone ahead and produced a more affordable model during that time. They axed the reasonably priced ones and only offer the luxuriously expensive ones. | >The F-150 Lightning is an incredibly important EV for Ford. In Fact, Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, and Executive Chair, Bill Ford, compared the pickup to the 21st-century Model T. It was heralded as the gateway for Ford's EV transition, though adoption has proven slower than anticipated. In fact, the automaker has already scaled back production targets to half of what was originally expected for 2024 and slashed two-thirds of the workforce at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center where the Lightning is assembled.

>Another slap in the face has come directly from Tesla. The F-150 Lightning, despite sales being up 86%, lost its title of best-selling EV pickup to the Cybertruck and the F-Series pickup as a whole is at risk of losing its 42-year crown as best-selling vehicle in America to the Tesla Model Y. Granted, those Cybertruck sales have largely been the fulfillment of years of orders, so it will be several months before we see if it has long-term juice or not. 

>According to data from Cox Automotive cited by Automotive News, Ford has a 100-day supply of F-150s on-hand at the end of September. Generally, dealers want cars on lots for 30-60 days at most. The firm didn't specify a specific estimate for the Lightning, specifically, but did mention a 128-day supply of the Ford E-Transit and a 130-day supply of Mustang Mach-Es. | The fuck's going on over there? | [deleted] |  Lightning should've launched the expedition first.  They already cost $90,000, they're mostly used as grocery getters with occasional towing.

Then I'd grab one. The ER is over 80k Canadian.... It's obscene. | The Lightning needs a refresh because the things that make an electric car great is outdated or undersized. 

I love my F150 Hybrid, that was my gateway to the Lightning. After a month with the Lightning, I felt the range was lacking. I didn't expect to get to the stated range, but I got way worse especially when I only charged to 80-85%. While my Model Y usually come in about 40 or so miles under the stated range, my Lightning came in almost 100 miles under the stated range. I got about 120ish miles on an between 10-80% charge (I found myself at a Charging Station a lot for a quick charge at the end of the day). It's enough but it doesn't leave my with enough buffer at times, but the overall range made it hard to do any light road trips on the weekends.

Also I see a lot of folks talking about them producing the overpriced model, and while I agree to some extent, their Platinum Lighting sucks. They had that ugly ass grayish blue for the longest time, and now they have this white/black combo. I felt like it the interior was a massive downgrade compared to the hybrid I was coming from and I accepted that it would be inferior when upgrading. 

I wanted to like the Lightning, but on paper and all the reviews I'm reading about the Sierra EV is basically what I want in a Lighting. If they can give me a regular F150 Platinum interior with roughly 400 miles of stated range so I can bump the usable range closer to 225 miles daily and have a truck that I can take to Tahoe or Yosemite without having to charge both ways. I'd consider getting it again. But it desperately needs a refresh, I wanted to like it because it's the only EV truck that's a traditional design so I can convert it to a work truck if I had to. But the overall experience is that a Rivian R1T is much nicer (but bed size and utility doesn't suit my needs), The Sierra means I can't plop a traditional lumber rack on it when I need. The Cybertruck is just a pass.

The Lightning legitimately could be good, and that's worst than just being a bad product. Range and interior quality and design is what kills it because you can get a gas/hybrid F150 and if we're comparing the Platinum (before they downgraded that and introduced the Platinum Plus) between the gas and the EV, the gasser was much nicer in every way even though they were suppose to be the same.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit
Honda undercuts Tesla Model Y after slashing Prologue EV prices,,443,284,1718367789,"...if you're in one of the few regions where there might be a single dealer willing to honor the lease offer. **And** with $4,000 due at signing.

This is a clickbaity nothing-burger. | Dont understand the whole trend of putting thousands down on a leaseâ€¦. Of course the monthly will look appealing if you put 5k down on a 36 monthâ€¦.. | Never knew Honda had an EV. | Most of these advertised lease rates simply aren't true for the vast majority of people - it's a gimmick to generate leads and get people in the door. 

I drive 20,000 miles a year w/ my current job, which unfortunately puts a lease out of being a realistic option. That being said - I looked through several of them just to see what the offers looked like and every single one of them ended up requiring some sort of down-payment with the payments at least $50 higher than advertised after all of the fees bundled into the lease. 

I ended up financing a 2023 Nissan Ariya that just came off lease w/ 9K miles on the odometer w/ under $500 a month payments and no down-payment. I think that's where a lot of these vehicles are going to shine - they'll depreciate upwards of $10K per year for the first two years, then be low-mileage off lease at a great price. | So I went and looked at one at the dealer. The interior is underwhelming. My 2017 civic has a more luxurious interior, it just felt so cheap. This was on the top of my list to check out and I wasn't impressed at all for the price they are charging. | My biggest problem with the Prologue (and GM's cheaper offerings) is the charging speed. Of course they don't advertise 10-80% time because it's not good, but even the advertised 65 miles added in 10 minutes sounds badâ€¦ that's presumably (65/296) = 22%, so 10-32% in 10 minutes? Ioniq 5 can do about 10-55% in 10 minutes and Model Y Long Range can do about 10-50% in 10 minutes. If Honda / GM could get those charging speeds up, they would be a lot more interesting to me. | Comparing the specs of the two cars, I'm wonder how much this matters?

It just seems like they like designing new stuff and aren't excited by executing well on what they have out now. | Oof, brutal 

I was always kind of side eyed Fisker. He feels like one of those designers who thinks he's just as or more important than the engineers. The way he bailed on his first Fisker startup, the way he's running his current one, and just the attitude of ""random EV shell made by someone on contract but designed by me"" feels... arrogant?

>Today, President Biden is announcing strong action to protect America from the national security risks associated with connected vehicle technologies from countries of concern. The Department of Commerce is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would, if finalized as proposed, prohibit the sale or import of connected vehicles that incorporate certain technology and the import of particular components themselves from countries of concern, specifically the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia.

>\[...\]

>As the Department of Commerce has found, vehicles' increasing connectivity creates opportunities to collect and exploit sensitive information. Certain hardware and software in connected vehicles enable the capture of information about geographic areas or critical infrastructure, and present opportunities for malicious actors to disrupt the operations of infrastructure or the vehicles themselves. Commerce has determined that certain technologies used in connected vehicles from the PRC and Russia present particularly acute threats. These countries of concern could use critical technologies within our supply chains for surveillance and sabotage to undermine national security.

Strike at BYD factory in Wuxi: workers seek fair treatment,,438,155,1716249186,"I'm a simple man. I see workers organizing, I upvote | I hope to see more throughout China.  Worker Solidarity.  
China's systematically low wages are strangling its economy. | Let's see what this sub thinks about BYD workers earning $5,000 a year.  Many seem to like BYD's cheap EV's while at the same time acting like Tesla is terrible because they aren't union, even though they obviously pay their workers much more than that. | Well this will be interesting to see play out! | So that's why their cars are so cheap? Hmm. | >The BYD factory in Wuxi was previously owned by the American company Johnson Controls. Last year, BYD acquired Johnson Controls' factories in Chengdu and Wuxi for a price of 15.8 billion yuan (2.19 Billion USD). After the acquisition, both Johnson Controls and BYD issued a joint announcement, promising that employee benefits would remain unchanged and, in some cases, even slightly improved. They also assured that severance pay would be provided to laid-off workers. However, it is reported that BYD did not fulfill these commitments, contributing to dissatisfaction among the employees.

...

>Chinese workers do not necessarily enjoy working overtime; they are compelled to do so due to circumstances. Factories often set basic wages just above the government's minimum wage to keep labor costs low. To make ends meet, employees accept long hours of overtime work since Chinese labor law requires employers to pay 1.5 times the regular wage for overtime and double the wage for weekend overtime.

>The job postings for the BYD factory in Wuxi in the past two months indicated a basic wage of 2,490 yuan (345 USD), which coincides with the minimum wage in Jiangsu province. Stable overtime hours are necessary to earn a monthly income of 5,000 to 6,500 yuan (690 to 897 USD) advertised by intermediaries. In electronics factories, a 10-hour workday is considered the minimum, and some factories even require employees to work 12 to 13 hours per day. By canceling overtime, BYD effectively reduced the maximum monthly income for employees to just over 3,000 yuan, which is seen as a fairly low salary.

Sounds like BYD lied and drastically decreased wages. | Man, it's tough when workers have to fight for fair treatment. Hope they get what they deserve. Workers' rights matter, you know?

Now I know EV is a bigger industry in the US but world wide particularly in Asia, just like bikes it's going to be a race to make them more and more affordable and accessible just like how bikes completed and still compete on price in the Asian markets.

EVs May Get Cheaper Than Gas Cars As Early As Next Year. Here's Why,"Between 2008 and 2023, the estimated cost of a light-duty electric vehicle's lithium-ion battery pack plummeted by 90%, going from a whopping $1,415/kilowatt-hour (adjusted for inflation) 16 years ago to a much more palatable $139/kWh last year. These estimates come from the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Vehicle Technologies Office, which added that the figures are valid for a battery pack's usable capacity, not the rated capacity, at a production scale of at least 100,000 units per year. 

According to Goldman Sachs (via Yahoo Finance), the estimated battery cost for last year is a bit higher at $151/kWh, but what's important here is that the same estimates show a further 40% decline in battery prices between 2023 and 2025, opening the door for much more affordable EVs that will finally undercut their gasoline counterparts and, at the same time, turn a profit for their makers. A study from the International Council On Clean Transportation previously showed that EVs will cost the same as ICE vehicles by 2029 thanks to an oversupply of lithium.

However enthusiastic these numbers are, it's worth noting that Goldman Sachs is referring to the total cost of ownership, which includes the price of the vehicle and fuel or charging costs, as well as repairs and maintenance over the lifetime of a car. What they don't include, however, are government subsidies such as the $7,500 federal tax credit. 

Battery costs amount to roughly one-third to one-fourth of a complete car, so it's not the only factor at play, but it's one of the biggest. China already figured out how to make electric cars cheaper than gas cars, albeit with heavy state incentives, but the U.S. is bound to catch up and finally offer people what they want: more affordable EVs.

Tesla is bound to launch a sub-Model 3 EV sometime next year and Ford is actively working on an affordable EV platform that will offer both a lower purchase price compared to the company's current portfolio and a healthy profit for the company. 

Until that happens, some automakers rely on attractive financing and leasing deals to entice wannabe shoppers. Low interest rates and affordable monthly payments, combined with the federal tax credit that can be applied even to cars that are not assembled in North America when leasing, sometimes mean that an EV is cheaper to own than its gas-powered alternative despite it having a higher MSRP.",440,230,1723243459,"The other thing is now we are starting to get low mileage low priced used EVs on the market. I picked one up in February. | That will be the death of ICE.  

Sure, lugheads will keep buying them for a while but the convenience of charging at home, the quiet clean simplicity, and the DIRT CHEAP FUELING COST will get most folks switching over.

Because if it gets cheaper to make, they can make more profit by keeping the price high. Nowadays it feels like they force us to buy bigger and expensive cars by discontinuing affordable, economic, small cars | I'm confused? The total cost of ownership for most is already well below that of a gas car. Surely they mean sticker price by 2029? | > China already figured out how to make electric cars cheaper than gas cars, albeit with heavy state incentives

BMW Is a Surprise Winner in Electric Vehicles,,438,285,1709993183,"BMW's EVs have drawn criticisms from both EV fans and traditional BMW fans, but I've been saying for a while now that their strategy of offering the same cars with the buyer's choice in drivetrain makes perfect sense. Not only do buyers of new BMWs get to choose what kind of propulsion they prefer, BMW themselves can still make profit on them and not need to invest billions in a completely new platform and assembly line for 15% of new cars sales, the shared platform ends up being a part of their gradual ramp up. People also forget that BMW has been making actual usable modern EVs for over a decade now as well (i3 owners love their cars) and it shows because even their converted cars are getting ""Tesla-tier efficiency"" in real world usage if we go by Bjorn Nyland's tests.

Of course it helps that they've significantly upped their interior and ride quality while Audi, and especially Mercedes, dropped the ball hard across the brand. BMWs ICEs are doing really well too, and the B48/B58 sending power through the ZF8 is one of the best modern powertrains you can put in a car, and they shove that thing in most of their cars, often offering the option of a PHEV variant with it. | Pre ordered my i4 in 2021, got it August 16th 2022 and I'm still happy with it to this day. | BMW owners are pretty loyal in my experience and they made compelling options at different price points to include an incredible sedan offering which I really wish more manufacturers would consider.  
  
Throw in that other reason, BMW owners have shown a willingness and ability to spend more and frankly their EV prices are not out of line. The i4, I am a sedan fan hence that choice, starts at as low at $52k which while a high number we must remember is a BMW starting near or even below than some Chevrolet Blazer   and Ford Mach E trims. | Good let all the legacy sell a ton of EVs, help bring down the cost, and hopefully get cheaper models out.

I'm sure it's many of the things listed below.

What I will pretend to know is why EV sales are funny right now.  That's because certain people simply won't even consider looking at EVs.  They have a preconceived notion of them being more expensive, difficult, or somehow not viable for their lifestyle despite potentially not being the case.

There's no doubt that there are circumstances where buying an EV just doesn't make sense for people, but I think a lot of people buying ICE vehicles right now very easily could buy a similar EV.  Right now, it's about manufacturers capturing that market.

To me, the two things that manufacturers can do to make a meaningful difference is.

1. Take a more hands on approach with charger installations.  There's no meaningful reason why they can't easily form a division where they have electricians who can go out and install chargers for people.  It's not complicated work most of the time.  It's also relatively profitable work.  Chevy did this semi-successfully with Qmerit, but Qmerit was an unnecessary middleman.  Just do the work yourself.

2. Get involved in DCFC.  VW especially is guilty of this.  Why the fuck isn't VW manufacturing DCFC stations?  They ""own"" EA.  They have the incentive.  Yet they just elected to be lazy and farm it out and it's been pretty much a relative disaster all things considered.  I know if I spent $60k on a piece of equipment and it had no reliability despite being not use that often in many cases, I'd be pissed.  I have a hard time believing that VW couldn't manufacture an DCFC unit cheaper than who they're buying from right now and not increase reliability.

Further more, why not stick these stations in dealerships?  I know a lot of people are against this model, but the reality is, dealerships are on main roads.  There are quite a few of them.  They have access to high power anyway because of their locations.  They have relatively large parking lots.  They benefit from people parking for 20-60 minutes as they can potentially get a new sale or do service to vehicles.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

TLDR: Ogawa is talking about *allocating production according to consumer demand* â€” he isn't saying EV manufacturing is a categorical waste.

In addition, time-induced ageing becomes dominant over cycling ageing, even at EV-relevant C-rates (â‰¤0.4C).

However, as the batteries age, additional degradation mechanisms become important.

The study tells that the natural way people drive, stop and go, accelerate and brake is better for the battery, than drive with a constant speed and charge immediately after driving. And if you let your EV idle for a long time, it's better to let someone take it for a drive in a stop/go fashion.

Nio and iirc Changan are now putting out semi-solid state batteries; which again, Tesla does not have.

The Hidden Autopilot Data That Reveals Why Teslas Crash | WSJ,,426,795,1734271854,"Does anyone know- Teslas that were built in years that do have radar hardware - do they even utilize it anymore since that the software stack development switched to camera only? | Summary by Gemini:

The video discusses the safety of Tesla's Autopilot technology. It highlights several crashes involving Tesla vehicles in Autopilot mode, including one that resulted in the death of Steven Hendrickson. The video argues that Tesla's reliance on cameras for its Autopilot technology is a fundamental flaw, as it struggles to recognize unexpected obstacles. It also criticizes Tesla for its lack of transparency regarding Autopilot data and its aggressive marketing of the technology. The video concludes by questioning the long-term viability of Autopilot technology and the need for greater regulation and oversight. | Relying on cameras was never going to work. | I'm the only bastard here who wants this tech not for taxis but buses. Seems like a huge boon to any metro area. | Don't worry all will be swept under the rug by President Elon | Well I know one thing they have issues with phantom braking.  Breaking hard for no GD reason in the middle of the highway while doing 70 mph. That is some scary sh*t.  I've had it happen to me more than I care for. I've been very lucky no one was behind me when it's happened. | The step in problem is still there. We have a  century now of understanding around human behaviour, the trend of more critical decision making as automation gets better ([automation paradox](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash)), the tendency for humans to think everything is ""fine"" when the system is in control ([automation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias)), and the problem of ""handing back"" control to a human when things are hard for software to solve - which tend to be situations that:

a) a human will also need to critically assess and may require context and time to solve, and 

b) have to be handled by a human who until that point had a high level of confidence in the software to deal with anything that happened, leading to a higher likelihood of complacency and reduced situational awareness, or sudden, exaggerated inputs to ""correct"" what must be a big problem if software couldn't handle it ([startle response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startle_response)).

It's really hard to argue a system that promotes itself on allowing the human to relax and have *less* situational awarenesss, does not create a high risk situation when it hands back control for a problem that requires a *high* level of situational awareness.

A pretty good (if extreme) example of all this was [the crash of Air France 447 in '09](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/the-long-way-down-the-crash-of-air-france-flight-447-8a7678c37982) - a modern plane with extremely strong autopilot functionality (to the point of inhibiting inputs that can create stall conditions) experiencing a pretty minor issue during cruise (pitot tube icing when flying through stormclouds) causes autopilot to suddenly disengage, and a slight drop in altitude and increase in roll.

This prompts exaggerated inputs from startled but otherwise experienced pilots, who quickly managed to enter into a stall - a situation they weren't used to dealing with (because autopilot usually stops that from ever happening), and which is easy to enter in their situation (that they should have realised) which leads to further confusion, lack of communication or understanding of the situation because they haven't had time to stop and assess, and still keep trying to pitch up because they're losing altitude. 

there's also the issue that some of the systems that guide the pilots on the correct course of action also indicated a pitch up angle to avoid stall - but this was after the pilots had already entered a full blown stall, seemingly unaware, and they simply deferred to the instructions on the screen.

By the time they work it out, minutes later, a crash is guaranteed.

Ironically, if the autopilot wasn't that good, they probably would have recognised the situation and avoided the catastrophic (human) decisions that led to the crash. | Should we investigate how humans crash too? Compare it to the ai and if ai crashes less which it does its better? ðŸ¤£ | I'd honestly like to know of similar cases and % of investigation on all other manufacturers with Level 2 ADAS. Since they've been around for as much as long as tesla I would say, but all buzz on internet seems to be toweards Tesla only. | It looks like many will think about FSD when watching this video. FSD is and will be limited by the choice of vision only, but like many other journalist pieces on Tesla, the title is misleading. I'm not a Tesla bro or Elon-Stan by any stretch (I just drive one because I hate the gas station), but the propagation of potentially untrue information is irksome. WSJ states they investigate autopilot crashes throughout the video, but there's a huge distinction between FSD and autopilot which is essentially lane keeping and adaptive cruise control (requires a vehicle in front to stop, does not stop at red lights unless you have EAP, which is phased out). So if one were to treat autopilot like a self driving car, that's essentially signing up with the grim reaper, much like if you use a Hyundai with lane keeping and cruise control as a self driving car in the city. I know folks in my circle who are interested in Tesla often believe all Teslas can self drive with autopilot and I have frequently had to temper their expectations.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

When you're purchasing commercial power, you don't just pay for the amount of electricity you consume, you also pay a ""demand charge"" based on your highest 15 minute power consumption over the past year. In some markets, if two EVs charge at 350kw for 15 minutes, it results in a 10k+ demand charge which carries over for 12 months.

It's more profitable for existing businesses to install it in order to attract more potential spending. 

The ante for this sort of development can easily be 6 figures in order to procure and install the chargers, but also the requisite switchgear and supporting infrastructure, and that's if no further site work is required, and existing hard top can merely be dedicated and striped. 

The competition will be from existing businesses looking to attract more customers as the number of EVs increases. | I love the Rivian network. $0.36 a kWh | Nice and cheap!

UK here, a lot of our service station chargers are 79p/Kwh, which works out spot on $1 at the minute. | Sorry, but I have to correct the units:

the price is per kWh, not per kW.  Its a very important distinction.  kW is power, kWh is energy.    
When you buy gasoline at the pump you don't pay for how fast the gas flows into your tank.  You pay for the amount of gas you buy.  You also don't pay for how much horsepower your car produces from the gasoline.  You pay for how much gasoline you buy.  

So ""how much gasoline"" - e.g. gallons or liters -- is equivalent to kWh.

And ""how fast the gasoline flows into your tank"" would be equivalent to kW charging rate (yes sometimes there's a premium for faster rates, but that's not relevant).  Also Power of your engine is equivalent to kW.

Watts (and kilowatts) are units of energy/time.  If you multiply energy/time by time, you get energy.  Likewise, if an amount of energy flows/moves from one place to another in a given amount of time, that's equivalent to power so a certain amount of kWh delivered in a certain amount of time (say 50kWh in 30minutes) would be 50kWh/0.5hr = 100kW charging speed.

Similarly, a gallon of gasoline holds a certain amount of potential energy (like kWh added to your battery).  So gallons of gas flowing per minute of fueling time is essentially a kind of power flow and the units would reduce to units of power if we wanted to go through it.

Just remember a kWh is a unit of energy like a gallon of gasoline.  When you charge your car you pay for how many kWh you added - NOT (usually) for how fast it was added although sometimes charging stations do add a premium cost for faster charging. | What is your cost per mile/km compared with Gas? | If makes you feel any better, we routinely pay the equivalent of $1.18 per kwh here in the UK for public rapid charging. | Damn, I pay 41Â¢ at superchargers on road trips on average and I thought that was bad.

July 18, 2024 08:00 AM

New U.S. electric vehicle registrations rose 9.6 percent in May on generous sales promotions and lease deals, even as Tesla's tally fell sharply for the fourth consecutive month, according to the most recent data from S&P Global Mobility.Battery-electric models from 31 brands captured 7.5 percent of the U.S. light-vehicle market up from 6.8 percent a year earlier, the data showed. New May EV registrations totaled 104,916 vehicles.The data does not include used vehicles or gasoline-electric hybrids.While EV registrations outpaced the broader light-vehicle market â€” down 0.7 percent to just under 1.4 million vehicles â€” deep discounts drove the results, said Tom Libby, associate director of industry analysis at S&P Global Mobility.

""In terms of pure sales performance, EVs are making progress, but underneath the sales are huge incentives,"" Libby said. ""They are not sustainable, and they are causing losses on the part of automakers.""Tesla, still the EV sales leader by a wide margin, saw its May registrations fall 15 percent to 48,587 vehicles, S&P Global Mobility said. Tesla's share of the EV segment dropped to 46 percent from 60 percent a year earlier. Among the strongest performers, Kia's registrations rose 146 percent, Rivian's numbers grew 87 percent, Hyundai increased 40 percent, and Nissan was up 87 percent year over year, the data showed. Registration data serves as a proxy to automaker delivery numbers because Tesla doesn't break out its U.S. sales and some other automakers don't report EV sales by model. But the figures lag by several weeks. 

Incentives' impact

Automakers in May poured on sales incentives, including subsidized financing and lease deals, with some models getting more than $15,000 in discounts, according to data from Motor Intelligence. May incentives on the Kia EV6, a compact crossover, reached $16,812, Motor Intelligence said. Kia's EV9 midsize crossover had $18,078 per vehicle, and the Cadillac Lyriq reached $17,732, the data showed.

Tesla's Model Y had relatively modest incentives of $5,570 in May, Motor Intelligence said. Rivian Automotive, which hasn't been profitable since launching in late 2021, offered incentives of $4,060 on its R1T pickup. In all these examples, discounts rose significantly from a year earlier. The Lyriq's May 2023 incentives were $761 per vehicle, Motor Intelligence said. The Model Y had $1,195.EV makers have little choice but to offer attractive deals, cut production or stay mostly on the sidelines, as Toyota has done by focusing on hybrids over EVs, said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. Brauer predicted last year that EV market share would reach around 7 percent and then stall, based on a study of U.S. consumer preferences by iSeeCars.""Here we are around 7 and a half percent, and what do we see?"" Brauer said. ""We see EVs stacking up at lots, we see \[assembly plant\] shifts being canceled, and we see massive incentives. Going from 2 to 5 to 7 percent EV market share was one thing. Going from 7 to 10 percent is another.""General Motors CEO Mary Barra told CNBC on July 15 that the automaker is pulling back from its production target of having capacity to make 1 million EVs in 2025. Rather, GM will add production capacity as consumer demand increases, she said. In the January-May period this year, GM had just over 30,000 combined EV registrations for its Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop brands. Buick doesn't yet offer an EV. The 7.9 percent gain in January-May EV registrations from a year earlier was a more modest result than many analysts had expected. In calendar year 2023, EV registrations rose 52 percent from the previous year, the U.S. data showed. ""We see that there's continued growth, but it's slower than we had forecast just several months ago,"" Libby said. The market share for electric vehicles rose to 7.2 percent in the January-May period, but that was a modest gain compared with the 6.9 percent share a year earlier.

Tesla models 

Tesla's series of sales declines is a key reason the broader EV market isn't growing faster, Libby said. During the first five months of the year, Tesla registrations fell 12 percent to 231,865 vehicles, and its share of the EV segment dropped to just under 50 percent from about 60 percent in the year-earlier period.Sales are growing for Tesla's Cybertruck pickup that launched in November, Libby said. But the automaker's core sedans and crossovers are aging rapidly and dragging down sales. Tesla's top seller, the Model Y, is mostly unchanged since it launched in 2020.  The Model 3 was freshened in January after seven years on the market. And the Model S sedan and Model X crossover are a decade old. ""Whatever the brand is, you have to refresh your products or they're going to fade, and that's what's happening with Tesla now,"" Libby said.  ""And it can't just be over-the-air software updates. There's no question that other brands are now eating into Tesla's share, both mainstream and luxury brands. ""Tesla said in April that it will launch new affordable models before the second quarter of 2025, but it didn't provide many details. The new vehicles will combine elements of its current architectures and a next-generation platform in development. They will be assembled on current production lines, Tesla said. | Well when Musk started showing how much of a Facist and POS and flat out pissing off his main base of buyers it is no wonder it is Tesla sells are falling.

BYD Launches New Dolphin EV Priced at $14K Sparking Price War,,421,267,1708704334,"* In China. | This already sells in New Zealand, which offers some market insights for those of you in the US or EU.


BYD bumped up the safety spec of the Dolphin to score well under our safety regs (ie to appeal to rich world car market consumers) and only sell the larger battery /range model here. The net result is it's a USD $25k car.


It doesn't seem to be selling that well here, probably because for $5k more you can get larger or higher spec EVs Inc the MG4 or MGZS, GWM Ora, BYD Atto 3. Or spend a bit more and get a much better Tesla or Opel | That's the kind of car that will eat everyones lunch. Cheap, with decent range. But keep making $80k EVs in the US and saying there's no demand. ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ | I drive 17 miles each way for work.

The Dolphin is $31K (MSRP) in Mexico... A Bolt EV 2022 is $48K there while it was $32,495 in the States...  That means a Dolphin, if it passed safety regs, would be $20K in the US. | I would totally buy one for a daily driver.

"Met a new owner of bZ4x, at broken EVGo, in single digit temps","I very very rarely use DC fast chargers anymore, but today's weather and winds meant that I had to make a stop to get home.   
The location (4 spots) was full when I arrived, but a bz4x was sitting there seemingly not charging.   Two guys kept getting in and out, talking on a phone, and trying to figure out the app.   It was extremely cold and my kid was sleeping in the car, otherwise I would have went to help out.

Anyway, one of the other vehicles finished and traded spots with the bZ, and I pulled into the possibly broken spot the bZ just vacated.  The CCS handle was a little bit broken, so my first thought was I'd be waiting longer...but I plugged in and started charging without issue and got back in the car to keep warm.

The owner or passenger, came to ask me for help to get their charge going.  They opted to not use their free charging, because they couldn't get it working, but we got them charging.   I warned that it's going to be expensive (72 cents/kw and 99 cents session fee...in hind sight, never stopping there again) and might take a bit since it's so cold.   We talked for a brief minute;   They just got the car yesterday, had been trying for an hour to get the charger working (nobody else was helping them, I guess), were on 8% SOC, and their app said it'd be a 3.5 hour charge.

Got me thinking how it was every possible variable was against them (cold, low SOC, full station, broken charger, expensive charger....and driving a bZ4x) and it could end up being a negative first impression.   Hopefully their experience improves with the car, though.",415,297,1705276462,"I had the same experience, pulled up to a full EA station and a bz4x was attempting to charge. After seeing him on the phone and disconnecting/reconnecting for a while, another driver finished charging and pulled out. I then pull in and immediately start to charge with no issues. I tell the driver of the bz4x that we can swap chargers (me just being curious) since I was not in a hurry. We swapped stations and once I connected my vehicle to the station he was in, iI started charging right away. However, when he connected his bz4x to the station I was charging at, he kept having the same issues and just went home. | BZ4x is going to lose Toyota a lot of the goodwill they've built up over the last few decades. People associate Toyota with quality. That doesn't apply to the BZ4x. | oof. TBH anyone who bought one of those and then did a long trip in cold weather probably didn't do a lot of research. | the Bz69wtf was designed to scare people back to gasoline.  
There is no other possible explanation for it to exist. | The good Lord has not blessed me with a lot of patience. If this was my first time, I would give that car back to the stealership (and take the L in money)  and get a gas car. Absolutely not worth it. | New EV owners may not understand the intricacies of charging.  I picked up an EV from a neighboring city and made sure we had charging figured out (tested at a nearby charger) before departing. It's out 2nd EV though and made a similar mistake to the BZ4 people the first time around â€¦ honest mistake | 
I honestly can't figure out why these other charging companies can't get their act together?!

We have a Tesla, Kia and MachE in our household. We have lots of friends with electric cars of different makes. Honestly, non-Teslas are such a gamble when it comes to reliable charging. 

Tesla supercharging is the freaking easiest thing in the world. No passwords, no credit cards, no screens to look at, no buttons to push, no nothing....You pull in, you plug in, it just works. It isn't a mystery why several manufacturers are switching over to the Tesla platform.

I recently took a trip with a friend of mine in her new ID4. It's a great car, super comfortable, in fact it drives/rides better than the model 3 (but that's a different post...). We had to stop twice for charging. One EA station we stopped at had 2 working chargers (out of 6!). There was a line, people were stressed out and pissed off at each other. It was a pretty miserable experience. | Does Toyota / Subaru provide any free charging at a particular DCFC provider?  Kinda like Audi / Porsche / VW providing some free charging credits at EA? | I used a V2 Supercharger yesterday and 3/6 dispensers couldn't start a charge lol. | I am a big Toyota fan. I own two Lexus SC400 V8 coupes, Prius Prime (my son's car), and used to own a LS430. 
I was so excited when Toyota announced the BZ4X and was going to make it my first EV. But then the wheels started falling off. Also, the 250-mile range and slow charging were major factors in me disregarding it. I hope they do better.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit

You Need Way Less EV Range Than You Think: Study,"The study revealed that depending on the state, the average daily driving distance for EVs was between 20 and 45 miles, consuming only 8 to 16% of a battery's EPA-rated range. Most EVs on sale today in the U.S. offer around 250 miles of range, and many models are capable of covering over 300 miles.",421,732,1708530762,"This reminds me of the airliner Dassault Mercure.  Engineers found that a vast majority of flights were with 1000 miles, so they built an airliner that was optimized for that and couldn't fly farther.  They sold 12 because even though most flights are less then 1000 miles, some aren't, and airlines didn't want to have one model for short range and one for long. | The problem comes down to price. I'm not going to buy a 85 mile EV for $30,000 for example, when I get get 250-300 miles for $40,000.

If that 85 mile EV was $10,000 NEW, then I think people would buy them, but range doesn't scale with price. | Yeah...the fact that people only go 45 miles on average is not useful data as that has never been the issue.


The issue is that people are used to being able to easily take their car a few hundred miles, at least on the odd occasion. Charging infrastructures and EV charging speeds generally still aren't great, and this is especially an issue if you go somewhere rural semi-regularly.


Most people don't *need* anything more than a smart car the majority of the time - and yet, trucks are a thing. People buy cars based on what they might do - and with what they do a few times a year in-mind. | I'm an EV owner and think they're the future. But this is an awful argument to make to Midwest or rural people thinking about making their first EV purchase. 

Do I need 247 miles of range in my car? Absolutely not, my commute is 60ish miles a day. But I can't take it to Chicago or a major city without stopping for a charge. The charger? Well maybe there's a couple of fast chargers on the way next to a dumpster of the gas station, boy I hope they work. 

Or people just buy a gas car with much more range and significantly less upfront costs. If someone wants to leave the state or city a few times of year for flights or concerts or something you essentially have to keep an ICE vehicle. 

Telling someone they don't need the range immediately turns prospective buyers off, even if it's true. Way better to continue to increase range and efficiency of EVs. | For those without home charging, higher range means less trips to recharge.  I charge at work and go 3 to 4 days between charges.  In general, yes people don't need cars with 300miles of range, but until everyone has home charging access, those higher capacities will help. | Eh... My ""300"" mile range EV when charging to 80% is a ""210 mile"" EV.... Yet I only get 165 miles going from 80 to 6% battery and just barely meets my range needs.. traveling  out of state on the hwy at the flow of traffic it's more like 100 miles per 50% battery in my experience. | That's never been the issue.

This is fine for the ""I never EVER EVER EVER leave the neighborhood"" or the slight anti-EV sentiment of ""you need a second car for road trips"".  Blah that sucks.

And I also drive under 45 miles per day in my EV.  Some days I don't drive at all.

However, every other weekend, my coaching duties take me about 250 miles.

I simply won't buy a car that can't take me on that trip.  I can take my damn bike to things that are 5 miles away.

When I need **a CAR**, it's for the every other weekend trip to a nearby town, or a once-a-month trip to go skiing or the annual road trip.

And all of those needs 250-300 miles of range to not suck.

There's a reason that EVs didn't really take off in sales until they offered a 200 mile range.  The 2013 Nissan leaf was a fine 60 mile car.  Everyone I know who has one is either an urban dweller who rarely leaves down or has a second car for ""longer trips"". | You don't buy a car for your average use case. You buy it for your maximal use case, so you don't have a bad day whenever you exceed your average need.

Of course, if you buy a car based on marketing vibes, you buy it for the use case that you aspire to. | I don't need 500 miles. But I do want to be able to drive to a nearby city without stopping. 

It looks like it is 178 miles from where I am currently on a short trip to my home. The flight was 30-45 minutes. 

Assuming some breathing room 250 is probably what I would want, 300 would be nice in a car as I will be using heater etc. 

Note: I didn't drive because my car is 20+ years old and I'm in this sub as I want an EV for my next one and trying to learn as much about them as I can. | I don't need 500 miles, but I do need about 300 miles in the worst conditions...which is about 500 miles EPA range, or a massively better charging network. If I want to take a trip to the next biggest city, like for instance to go to Microcenter. It's 100 miles one way. I don't want to have to sit for 30+ minutes in the car, paying outrageous electricity rates to charge for what I consider a short day-trip. The problem is that a 300 mile EV, won't get there and back on a single charge in the winter. My EV6 GT-Line RWD, from 100% to when the car goes into low-power mode, at 70 MPH on the highway (at the speed-limit), in the winter running the heater set to 65F, gets roughly about 2.3mi/kWh, for a total of about 175 miles on the charge. That's the problem. Now in the summer, I get about 2.9-3.1 mi/kWh, so that same trip I can get about 225 or so miles, which means that if I charge to 100% before hand, I can make the trip without stopping at the overpriced $0.65/kWh Chargepoint charger, or the broken 30kWh @ $0.45/kWh EA charger that are the only two options on that trip.

This is the only reason we have 1 EV and 1 ICE vehicle still. Once we can get an EV with a 500 mile range, the ICE will be gone.",electricvehicles,,Other,Reddit
