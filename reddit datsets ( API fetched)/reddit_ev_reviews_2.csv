Tesla is NOT a luxury vehicle!,"I drove a M3 for 3 years. It was a great car but let's all be very clear here, it is NOT a luxury vehicle. 

The average new vehicle in the US costs $47k. The Long Range versions of both the M3 and MY are under that. So, below average. But somehow people still see these things like they're a luxury sports car!

I have to rent a car while mine is repaired and Enterprise, Hertz, and all the Turo listings in my area want over $100/day for a base M3. The same price they're charging for luxury SUVs with an MSRP over $60k.

"Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losers","Recently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo

2: Chevrolet Blazer: 4/10

Buy an Equinox. Or buy a Lyriq if you have the cash. This car feels like a worse version of both at the same time, and I'm not sure why. Chevy for some reason seems to not quite have 1 pedal driving down as well as Cadillac does, and while I could forgive this for the Equinox to an extent, it somehow feels worse in the Blazer. Likewise, the interior is a major downgrade from the Lyriq but not *really* an upgrade over the Equinox. There's stiching on the doors, but it's all softish plastic, not even fake leather. Dash feels very similar, as do the buttons to the Equinox. I'd say it's like \~10% nicer, and you get a HUD and a slightly larger vehicle than the Equinox. But if you want that, stretch for the Lyriq or get a slightly used one for the same price.

My first thought given the RS badge was that this would be the ""sporty"" one, but no. Zero steering feel, poor pedal feel, numb acceleration. I could forgive it, but given there's better options that GM makes, I think they just messed this one up

Oh, and normal door handles. The Blazer has that while the Equinox and Lyriq have the the pop out door handles. I have no idea why. It feels like they had a bunch of ICE Blazer door handles and want to use them up

3: Ford F-150 Lightning: 8/10

Now, to start; I am not a Truck guy. I don't have any use for one. No one in my family owns one. So keep that in mind for this review

But I gotta say, I was really blown away by the F-150 Lightning. It's a huge truck, but it really doesn't FEEL that way. The steering is good, manuverability is great, far better than you'd think for such a beast. Honestly, other than the massive tires reminding me, it felt like I was driving a midsized SUV, not a full sized truck

If you don't tow far or often, and you want a full sized, Ford is offering a whole bunch of cash on the hood. And it feels like a normal Ford! Physical gear shifter, same sort of seating, same UI. A bit meh UI, but it's very user friendly. I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed it

It solves the two major issues imo of a full sized ICE truck; fuel economy and driving feel. If you can get a deal and want a truck; jump on it. Just be aware that this is very much a gen 1 product and won't hold value

4: Hyundai Ioniq 5: 8.5/10

You know that saying that a heretic is worse than a heathen? That's my experience with the Ioniq 5. It's *so close* to being a 10/10, but there's a few ergonomic issues that just really kill it

It has great one pedal driving, imo tied for 2nd with Tesla, slightly behind Volvo. Great charging speed, suprisingly fun handling given its an SUV. Read the reviews; it's great, everyone says it is, and I agree with them

*However*; 3 major issues that I found. First; the steering wheel obscures the gauge cluster unless you put it up unnaturally high. Second, the seat. I couldn't really find a comfy seating position; even with the seat all the way down, I felt like my head was almost touching the roof, and I'm not even that tall at \~6'1. Third, the bezels around the infotainment are absurdly large. It feels like an old timey TV with the massive box around them

Now, most of this is apparently fixed in the 2025 model year refresh. But it's just frustrating becasue even with the Ioniq 6 which I saw there, the bezel issue wasn't as bad. They know it's bad clearly! But it took awhile to fix. If you don't mind these things, then this is imo the best value. But I can't get over it

5: Tesla Model Y SR: 6/10

This is another similar casualty to the Blazer and the Ioniq 5. It's not AWFUL; although I find the interior to be pretty bad for the price. But the Model 3 highland fixes all the issues I have with the current Model Y, and it does it while being cheaper. I'd really, *strongly* recommend waiting until whatever the Model Y update

Drivetrain wise, pretty good! Tesla has good one pedal driving, like I said previously. It just falls apart with the interior quality. I found that the fake wood (or maybe real?) just felt really bad to the touch. I had a hard time adjusting the air vents in a pleasing way, which was annoying. The seats were just very uncomfortable, the merged headrest felt awful after awhile. Maybe if it was an economy car, whatever. But given the only configuration available for purchase new is the LR at \~$60,000 CAD, I expect better

Otherwise, I think it's... okay. For the price it was useable when the only competition it really has was the ID.4 and nearly impossible to get models like the Ioniq 5. But now supply has caught up, new models exist, and like I said; I *know* that Tesla can do better because they do! They have a great product in the form of the Model 3 Highland!

6: Chevrolet Equinox: 9/10

Chevy has a hit in the making if they can just market it well. This car will be my next vehicle.

Now that my cards are on the table, I will offer some criticism. The UI works fine, concerns there are overblown. But it's just a bit slow. Not the WORST (looking at you Volvo) by any means, but something that's disappointing. 1PD isn't super smooth, but it's less bad than the Blazer

Otherwise, I'll just say that this car provides value. Good range, okay charging speeds, but good enough. This is the car of close enough; everything except range isn't really class leading, but for the price and all together makes a great package

My biggest complaint? I'd like to denounce the Chevy exec who gave this thing 21 inch rims. It looks ridiculous, like a child wearing their father's shoes. But hey, maybe there were people who said ""yes, I'd love worse ride quality and worse fuel economy"". Maybe there are! If so, I'll apologize; you're a victim too

I honestly want to try and hypermile this. I genuinely think if I knocked this thing down to 19 or 18', I could hit the high 550s

7: Tesla Model 3 SR (Highland): 9/10

Tesla is the Apple of cars; you love it or you don't, but you have some sort of feeling about it one way or another. But if you're a spiritual Android user, if you can swallow your dislike, there's a LOT to like here

Every material issue I have with the model Y is basically solved. Better materials, better comfort, it feels quieter. Already very great UI is somehow even faster and better. For under $50k CAD, the RWD Standard range provides a whole bunch of value. \~440 km of range, good charging, access to the Tesla network (obviously), ventilated seats... again, 90% of my issue with it comes down to the monoscreen. I Just Don't Like It. It's not an issue for driving, but I don't find it aesthetically pleasing

But like I said; tonnes of value here if you like it or don't care about the layout.

8: BMW i4 M50: 10/10

You ever hear the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none. But better the Jack, than a master of one""? That is the BMW i4 to a tee. Nothing really crazy; even in terms of HP, there's faster cars out there. But my god does it come together in a fundamentally great package. The owner of this car was an enthusiasts, so he encouraged me to really give this the gas (or whatever) and it was great. He took over for awhile and REALLY gave it, and imo you could feel the weight around 9/10ths - but frankly, I don't think I'd ever get it there with any regularity, so the remaining 8/10ths are great

The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that it's pricey. My man had literally every possible option, down to the full leather seats, and the special paint. He said it was near 100k all in all. Now he also mentioned offhandedly that his wife sat in and loved the new iX and so they bought it when he went to pick his new i4 up a few years back, so I assume he's good for money, but still. Damn pricey

After a few years of BMW depreciation though? Madon, fantastic used vehicle

9: Nissan Ariya: 6/10

Who is this for?

In theory, the Ariya isn't a bad vehicle. It's rather nice actually; comfortable interior, very smooth powertrain, nice touchpoints. Very roomy! It feels like a much larger vehicle than it is

My issue with it was that its top trim is nearly $*65,000 CAD*. And it used to be more! They simplified the 25 trim differences, and that used to hit the 70s! The small battery option is in the mid 50s, and then it gets progressively more expensive. What justifies that? No super fast charging like the Ioniq 5, no major range, not really any brand appeal. Nissan seemed to make a Murano equivalent, but I never see Muranos! I see Rogues! They needed a Leaf varient with Rogue styling, and didn't deliver. I saw one for sale today with an advertised $10,000 cash on the hood. That says everything, imo

If it topped out at, say, 60, then I think that'd be fair enough. But even then, I find the local Nissan dealership awful to talk with based on my sister's experience with them, but that's not necessarily Nissan's fault

11: Volvo EX40: 7.5/10

You know the gene some people have that makes Cilantro taste like soap? That's Volvo. You either have the gene that makes you love Volvo, or you don't. I happen to have it, but I'll try and be objective

The powertrain; fantastic. It's smooth, but not in the same way as Hyundai or Tesla with their 1 pedal driving. You feel everything, but it feels fantastic. Steering is tight while driving fast, while instantly becoming very light and manuverable at low speeds. Great sound system even in the ""cheap"" harmen kardon option versus the B&O, and incredibly comfortable seats, as Volvo often does well

The downside is that this is a 40 series, not a 60 series, and it feels like it. Not super plush in terms of touchpoints, the seats are a textile blend. But it still feels nice enough. It's also very clearly a first gen product; it's just an electric XC40. Infotainment system also needs some work; it's slow, menu hell, and just generally a pain

But like I said; it's just so *nice* that I can ignore any flaws. Buy it used or lease it, and wait for the new EX60 to come out",1234,517,10/7/2024 19:45,"Like the reviews. Well done.

I guess they are killing the Ultium branding (which is probably a good idea)...so what do we call them now?   I guess just ""GM EVs""? | I'm glad Chevy seems to be doing well.

If Lyriq and Blazer/Equinox deals are an indicator, then I am trembling in anticipation at their Vistiq and Escalade IQ deals, not to mention the inevitable Yukon Denali/Tahoe/Suburban EVs. | I saw both Blazer and Equinox EVs within the same block. They are going to be very popular as an upgrade from Bolt owners. | We got an Acura ZDX (basically a fancy blazer) and it's incredible. So proud it was made in USA. It drives so nice and is so practical | I just bought a brand new equinox ev. And I can totally see why sales are booming. Got nearly $15k off sticker after tax credit and a bunch of rebates. Plus the car is great! And I can power my home with it.",electricvehicles,https://www.motor1.com/news/737512/general-motors-ev-sales-2024/,miskinasde,News,Tesla,Reddit
"Kia U.S. EV Sales Hit A New Record In April 2024 | For the first time in history, the company sold roughly 5,000 all-electric cars in a single month.",,978,295,5/1/2024 14:12,"They'd sell even more if their dealerships weren't such utterly dreadful experiences. | IMO it was such a massive miss for Ford to not bring an electric Explorer to the market with the Mach E. 

As soon as kids enter the picture, these sedans get REAL small when you start putting car seats in, dogs, and then all your stuff. 

We cannot wait to get an EV9. | While every other brand contracts, Kia/Hyundai/Genesis are pushing more and more EVs in to the US.

I'm expecting them to start pushing out their own charging network at this point - Fill the vacuum that Tesla is creating. | Let's face it, Hyundai/KIA are going to be better positioned to meet Tesla's promises before Tesla does. | I'm driving a Kia and it's been great for 5 years. Really nice little EV. | Bring more to Canada | I want one so badly, but I have to wait until April 2025 before I can buy one :(. I got to test drive one and almost told the guy to get me the paperwork but I need to wait. Love what Kia and Hyundai are doing in the EV world! | They keep advertising the EV9 in Canada but they are shipping so few that no dealership has one for test drive. They are apparently all selling online sign un seen which I think is crazy as I barely find half the vehicles I test drive comfortable or have visibility problems for someone over 6 foot. | I'm seeing a lot of EV9s on the road these days üëçüèª And of course there's Ioniq 5s everywhere. | The Kia EV9 is an amazing EV and it is reasonably affordable.",electricvehicles,https://insideevs.com/news/718103/kia-us-ev-sales-april2024/,chrisdh79,News,Tesla,Reddit
"Tesla's NACS Set to Become Official US Federal EV Charging Standard | This decision aims to unify and streamline the nation's EV charging infrastructure, promising greater compatibility, efficiency, and accessibility for EV users.",,975,524,12/5/2024 16:14,"Thank goodness. The CCS/NACS divide reminds me of early in the deployment of national cell phone networks when the FCC failed to name a standard and for a decade we had CDMA, TDMA, and GSM all competing. Other countries picked one standard and unsurprisingly had much better coverage for everyone. | I'm just glad Tesla approached this in a way that the seat belt we all use today was adopted. It's the best thing for the industry to use one charge port type at no royalty expense to any manufacturer that chooses to adopt it. The US government adopting it will further drive existing manufactures wh... | This should pave the way for NACS only NEVI funded chargers. | SAE J3400, \*not\* ""Tesla's"" -- this really is important to understand. | Now we just need to make everyone accept credit cards like at gas stations and not require users to download an app and make them preload $10 on it. | From the article: Kristin White, Acting Federal Highway Administrator, confirmed the significance of this shift at a recent Alliance for Automotive Innovation conference. She announced that federal agencies would soon issue updated guidance to incorporate NACS into federally funded EV charging proje... | It's a shame it took this long. | Good. The ccs connector is a ridiculous amateur science experiment of a design | I dont mind my CCS plug.  Sure it's kind of heavy at the DC chargers and awkward since it's so big but it works like it should. | Just 2 years ago this sub would argue daily about Tesla's charger would never become standard.ù And then NACSù was announced and this sub laughed at how stupid it was.

EVgo nabs $1.25 billion loan as Biden races to approve more EV spending ,,969,144,12/14/2024 16:37,"More chargers is great, but man evgo is expensive af lol In my area its basically .70 kwh during peak times  + the 1 dollar session fee. | Please actually do something with the money

Every single EVGo charger I visit needs attention/repairs of some kind | The best thing Biden can do to lessen the damage of the anti-science, anti-EV drill-baby-drill oil regime coming to power in US is to fund as much EV charging infrastructure build out as possible before the US goes into the dark ages.

7500 chargers from EVGo alone will help a lot.

Close to $3.5B o... | I think this headline is a bit funny because I imagine the loan is from the EPA's LPO and not from the whitehouse directly. It almost makes it seem like there was less vetting/thought out into the loan than there probably was. | 350kwh chargers¶..JES PLEASE!!!! | I hope he gives all the rest to Blue states. Otherwise the Red states will follow the Convicted Felon's instructions and not spend it (as they did Medicare expansion). | Talking about Biden ""racing"" after doing effectively nothing for the last 2.5 years is pretty funny |  Maybe EVGo would finally add more than four chargers in my area. | EVGo in the northeast can be reasonable in my experience and sometimes uses variable time of day pricing, but what I like is the Autocharge+ thing they've got going on for them. Just plug in and it charges, no other interaction needed. Renewable energy purchase guarantees and offsets are nice too. | [deleted]",electricvehicles,https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320443/evgo-doe-loan-biden-ev-charging-money-trump,yourbasicgeek,News,Tesla,Reddit

Kinda hate it, kinda like it. Nice to see a big, offbeat swing... but it feels a bit overwrought and likely will not age well. I imagine the depreciation on these is going to be epic. | The most GM vehicle that I could imagine | Looks like a hearse, ngl | I think it's a mule. It's missing a bunch of things. | It kinda looks like someone crashed a Porsche 928 *really hard* into the back of a Cadillac CT5.
