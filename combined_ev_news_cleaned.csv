The Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Is So Much Car: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/745373/2024-porsche-cayenne-turbo-e-hybrid-coupe-review/,"Tons of power, tons of weight, tons of money.",12/25/2024 1:24,"Nothing inspires mixed emotions quite like a performance plug-in hybrid. At first, it seems like a perfect middle ground between gas and electric. There’s smooth, emissions-free driving for running around town, big range and quick refueling for long trips, and huge performance when you let the engine and motor work in tandem.
The new Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid does offer all that. But, it’s not quite as simple as having your cake and eating it too.
Porsche facelifted the third-generation Cayenne for the 2024 model year, and the changes are extensive. For the plug-in hybrid models, the battery capacity increases from 14.1 kilowatt-hours to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, which brings a big bump in electric range. The motor also gets an increase from 134 to 174 horsepower, and combined with a revised twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid produces a ripping 729 hp and 700 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than the old Turbo S E-Hybrid. More than any combustion SUV out there now, save the mechanically similar Lamborghini Urus SE.
But there is a price to pay for this blending of combustion and electricity—and not just the steep $158,995 base price of the 2025 model (our tester was a 2024). Porsche quotes a curb weight of 5,719 pounds for this Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe. The Cayenne GTS Coupe, which uses the same V-8 without the hybrid system, weighs nearly 700 pounds less.
The whole thing is a little absurd. Not just the weight figure on its own, I mean the whole thing. A luxury SUV that nods toward efficiency and the need to reduce our environmental impact but also has a twin-turbo V-8 and weighs as much as two original Boxsters. It’s just so much car.
The weight dominates everything. Admittedly, this Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid coupe handles its weight as well as it can, thanks to the optional rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll systems. It’s freakishly agile and body roll is kept to an absolute minimum when you put it into Sport Plus mode, where the car lowers on its air springs and stiffens up its adaptive dampers. Through corners, this Cayenne doesn’t feel its weight whatsoever.
Steering is precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, but surprisingly light. And below 50 miles per hour, when the rear wheels are calibrated to turn in the opposite direction of the fronts, there’s this slightly unnatural sense of the car castering around that takes a bit to get used to.
Porsche revised the springs and dampers for all facelifted Cayenne models, and here, they provide an uncanny-good spread of soft, cushion-y ride quality and sport-sedan-like handling. Even on the optional 22-inch wheels, big bumps barely make a blip. Basically, it rides and handles in a way that is entirely divorced from its huge weight and tall ride height.
Still, you’re always conscious of the weight under braking. Even slowing down at low speeds for a stop sign, you can feel all that mass shifting around beneath you. It never feels quite right. Also not helping matters is the fact that the braking is inconsistent. It’s always a challenge to blend regenerative braking from the motor and friction braking, especially when you have carbon-ceramic rotors, as our tester does.
Coming to a complete stop around town, you always end up getting a bit more braking than you want. The motor drives through the Cayenne’s eight-speed automatic, so when you’re coming to a stop, the car has to balance motor regeneration with downshifts. You don’t feel the shifts, but the sensation is similar to aggressive engine braking. Trying to be perfectly smooth rolling to an intersection is a real challenge.
Occasionally the hybrid system hiccups when getting up to speed too, but once you’re going, it’s all very smooth. The engine cuts in and out seamlessly, and the motor is always ready to deliver a wallop of torque.
It’s silly quick, unsurprisingly. The electric motor and engine combine to make the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid feel like it’s got a supercharged Chevy V-8 under the hood. You go to pass someone on the highway, and the eight-speed auto downshifts a gear, maybe two, before an endless surge of power. Get on it hard from a low gear, and it’s even more eye-opening. Performance like this was not long ago exclusive to upper-echelon 911s.
This might be heretical to say, but it sounds better than a lot of new 911s, too. As part of the Lightweight Sports Package—a laughable line item for a 5,700-pound car—you get a center-exit sports exhaust, and it’s raucous. Even in its quiet modes, there’s an ever-present burble from the V-8 and a muscle-car thunder with the valves fully open. It’s childish and totally addictive.
Still, the harder you get on it, the more fuel you’re going to burn. Which is, of course, obvious, and normally not a concern in a hi-po SUV. But in a little over a week with the car, I couldn’t stop thinking about fuel economy. I imagined a guilt-free yet powerful V-8 experience, and while the hybrid system can decrease fuel consumption, it doesn’t turn this Porsche into a Prius.
As with all plug-in hybrids, you have to charge it often. Updated Cayenne hybrids get an 11-kilowatt on-board AC charger, so if you have the right setup at home, you should be able to get a full battery in around two and a half hours. And the range is excellent. The EPA says it’ll do 24 miles on a charge, but I regularly saw figures closer to 40 miles.
If you’re driving around town slowly, you’ll get great fuel economy. Hell, you can leave the Cayenne in E-Power mode and the V-8 will never even turn on until you get on the throttle hard. Longer trips at higher speeds are a mixed bag, though. I drove the car 200 miles and back mostly on the highway, but with about 20 miles of slow New York City traffic. With a full battery, I managed nearly 27 mpg compared to 22 mpg with around a quarter of a battery. It’s not nothing! But, it’s still conspicuous consumption.
Ultimately, you’re left with something that's the best of both worlds, and the worst of both worlds. Under the right circumstances, you can get a big efficiency benefit from the hybrid system, but at other times, it’s a lot of extra weight to carry around.
Philosophically, the base Cayenne E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid probably make more sense, pairing a lighter, more efficient V-6 with the same battery and motor. But, the performance and speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick personality typical of a Porsche Turbo is undeniable. I like this thing a lot, even though I also find it totally ridiculous and suspect that it’s likely not quite as satisfying as a pure gas car, or a full EV.
And this being a review of a Porsche, we can’t end before talking about the price. It is so damned expensive. Notably, the base price between this 2024 test car and the equivalent 2025 model jumped from $153,050 to $163,945. The as-tested price of this one rises from $191,230 to just under $200,000. You can skip a lot of the options our tester has, like the $9,070 carbon-ceramic brakes and the $10,700 Lightweight Sport Package (though it is the only way to get these amazing houndstooth seats). Still, it’s a very expensive car no matter how you slice it.
I suppose it’s natural for a complicated car to engender complicated feelings. Some moments, you love it. Others, you’re baffled by it. And often, you’re left astonished by just how silly it is. I sort of want one, and I’m slightly disturbed by that notion.
Like I said earlier, mixed emotions.

Hyundai EV Owners: You Can Get A Tesla NACS Adapter For Free,https://insideevs.com/news/745429/hyundai-nacs-adapter-ev-q1/,Christmas came a couple of days early from Hyundai this year. The Tesla North American Charging Standard adapter will be free in Q1.,12/24/2024 9:00,"In recent months, more and more automakers have started selling North American Charging Standard (NACS) adapters to allow owners of their electric vehicles to access the vast Tesla Supercharging network. Ford will sell you one for $200, Polestar and Volvo will hook you up for $230 and General Motors will do it for $225.
But there's even better news if you drive a Hyundai: you'll be able to get a NACS adapter for zero dollars next year. That means that owners of the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and Kona Electric will be able to use Tesla's Supercharger network at no cost whatsoever. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hyundai.
The Korean automaker announced this week that Hyundai EV owners who have purchased or leased their vehicle on or before Jan. 31, 2025 will be able to request an adapter in the MyHyundai online owner portal. ""This Hyundai-authorized adapter will give CCS-port-equipped Hyundai EV drivers access to more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers in the United States,"" the automaker said.
Hyundai officials also indicated the Genesis luxury brand will eventually do the same with details to be announced early next year; no word yet on Hyundai's corporate cousin Kia, although a similar approach could be likely.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 Adapter
Nearly every automaker operating in America is pivoting to Tesla's style of plug—now known as the SAE J3400 standard—and allowing access to Tesla's charging network to give EV owners a better overall experience. Yet Hyundai is arguably making some of the biggest and earliest moves in that direction. The new 2025 Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 will actually include a NACS plug from the factory, and will use the traditional CCS style of plug with a separate adapter of their own. Hyundai officials have said that adapter use will not impact charging speeds for either type of car.
The automaker said that owners can check HyundaiNews.com for future updates.

"VinFast Whistleblower Alleges Structural Flaws 'Could Cause Wheels To Come Off,' Gets Fired",https://insideevs.com/news/745412/vinfast-whistleblower-fired-safety-concerns/,The engineer took to Reddit to with safety and quality concerns over the design of VinFast's suspension and chassis components.,12/23/2024 15:00,"It’s an accepted fact that VinFast’s cars aren’t very good. The brand has been plagued with missed delivery dates, poor reviews, low sales and an alarming allegation that it has police detain critics of its products in its home country. Now things are going further. Last week, an engineer responsible for VinFast’s latest models claimed he was fired after an ask me anything thread on Reddit. The engineer, Hazar Denli, became really concerned about the quality of the suspension components on its models.
According to reporting from the BBC, Denli became concerned with VinFast’s approach to speed and deadlines, insisting that the brand was cutting corners with its product, particularly with development on the VF6 and VF7 crossovers that have been slowly making their way out of Vietnam, and into new markets. For instance, Denli said that parts wore out five times as quickly during validation testing as they should have; some parts only lasted as little at 15,000 miles when they should have gone for 95,000 miles. Troublingly, Denli said this premature wear could lead to a loss of control of the vehicles.
""We saw, for example, the front strut-to-knuckle connection was loosening, which could be extremely dangerous,"" Denli told the BBC. ""It could cause a loosening of the entire structure that could cause wheels to come off.
Denli says that JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) conspired with its parent group Tata Group, alongside VinFast, who figured out who made the Reddit thread. When Denli was identified, he was subsequently terminated and his name was blacklisted in an industry recruiting software, the BBC says. Keep in mind that VinFast’s IPO paperwork revealed that Tata Technologies (part of Tata Group) did much of the chassis engineering for all of VinFast’s models, except for the VF3 and VF5.
This is very concerning, and adds onto existing problems for the automaker. An accident involving a VinFast VF8 is already under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. On, April 24, 2024 a VF8 struck a tree, and caught fire, killing the family of four inside. Denli’s claims track with the previous reporting we’ve done at InsideEVs. Earlier this year, we reported on Sonnie Tran, a Vietnamese blogger who was critical of Vinfast’s products in his home country. Tran alleged that VinFast used the police to harass him, even arresting him and threatening jail time if he didn’t take his criticism down.
Right now, VinFast has delivered on its promise to produce the VF3 through VF9, at least in Vietnam. All of these models are on sale, and the brand plans to export them to new markets. Just a few weeks ago one of the alleged vehicles of concern, the VinFast VF6, was officially put on sale in a handful European countries. VinFast still plans to sell these cars in the U.S. by 2026.
We will be watching with interest and concern as to how this will play out. The Vinfast VF8 has 28 complaints according to the NHTSA. Denli is trying to hold JLR to an employment tribunal, claiming he had done nothing wrong.

Tesla’s CyberCab Can Be Driven With An Xbox-Like Controller: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/745398/tesla-cybercab-xbox-controller-drive/,"Tesla's Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel, but it does work with a video game controller.",12/23/2024 13:44,"The Tesla Cybercab shocked the world when it made its first appearance without any form of traditional driver controls. We're talking about no steering wheel, no pedals—nothing for someone in the front seat to put their hands (or feet) on to control the car or override the software. It turns out that Tesla's workaround is to pilot the car like a video game, literally.
That small tidbit comes from a report by AutoEvolution which has some sources at the Petersen Museum where the Cybercab is on display until the new year. According to the report, Tesla's super secret method is a small Xbox-like game controller that plugs into the car to control steering and pedal input since, you know, there's no other hardware installed in the car that can do this.
Cybercab controls recently came into question after the Petersen Museum recently showed some behind-the-scenes footage of the Cybercab arriving at its facility. In the video (embedded above), the car can be seen working its way up a ramp with someone in the front seat. People speculated that someone was sitting in the seat to maneuver the car, especially since it was unlikely that Tesla's FSD software could figure out how to navigate inside a building.
It turns out they were right.
AutoEvolution says that its sources confirm this method was used to control the car while it was inside of the museum. The sources also confirmed that the car could be controlled wirelessly from outside (like a big RC car).
We also know that Tesla is working to hire a fleet of robotaxi operators. These teleoperators will work as safety operators when the automaker launches its first company-run fleet—presumably before 2027—although it has a number of kinks to work out first. These operators will likely control the vehicle remotely to remediate safety or navigation problems that the Robotaxis are unable to overcome on their own, similar to how Waymo uses remote operators when it is unsure of how to handle a situation (for example, confirming which lane is blocked by cones so it doesn't get caught in wet cement).
The automaker must also figure out how it plans to launch the service, including the tough human side of the business like vehicle cleaning and maintenance. General Motors recently bowed out of this side of the business after determining the amount of capital it would take for Cruise to launch and maintain its service. Tesla also needs to decide where it will first launch the service, though recent reports indicate that Tesla has its eyes on Texas due to the lack of regulation around autonomous vehicles.
All of that being said, keep in mind that Tesla intends to make these cars available for the general public to purchase. That means these are issues that the public—whether operating their own fleet or personally owned robotaxi—will need to overcome as well. Will the public have their own Tesla controller at the ready in case their car does something unexpected, or if they need to pilot it outside of the operational design domain? With the current state of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, things will have to change before a controller-controlled car can hit the streets. But given Musk's close-knit ties to the president-elect, anything is possible.

Nio Budget Brand Firefly Unveils First EV And It Looks Familiar,https://insideevs.com/news/745344/nio-budget-brand-debut/,Nio wants Firefly to be a global brand selling cars in Europe and the Americas but not in the U.S. for now.,12/23/2024 10:26,"Nio has just revealed the first electric vehicle that it wants to sell under its Firefly budget brand, a hatchback that will retail for just over $20,000 in China. When it reaches Europe sometime in the first half of 2025, it will likely cost a lot more than that due to tariffs and markup, but the company believes it will still be competitive, facing rivals from Smart or Mini.
Firefly’s compact EV, known simply as the Firefly EV, has more than a passing resemblance to the Honda e. It is bigger and a bit more rounded, and its unique front and rear light clusters give it a unique identity. Technical details are virtually nonexistent for now. We don't even know if the vehicle is front-wheel-drive or rear-wheel-drive; all we know is what we can see, as well as the fact that it will support battery swapping.
With its rear seat folded, the maximum load volume is 44.1 cubic feet (1,250 liters) and it also has a 3.24-cu-ft (92-liter) frunk.
Nio wants to create a network of Firefly-specific battery swapping stations in Europe, which it says cost about a third compared to the ones it has already installed for vehicles from the main brand. However, we don’t know the vehicle’s battery capacity or range rating, although we do know what the sales model will be.
Unlike the main Nio brand, which has a direct-to-consumer sales model avoiding traditional dealers, Firefly will have a completely different approach. Firefly vehicles will be sold through existing dealer networks, but they won't be dedicated to the brand, so they will likely be sold alongside other brands.
It will likely offer the vehicle without a battery, which you will lease from the manufacturer and pay a subscription to gain access to the swapping station network. This is called “battery as a service” (or BaaS), and it lowers the upfront cost of the vehicle and frees owners from having to worry about battery maintenance, but they will have to contend with monthly payments.
Nio first introduced BaaS in 2020, and in August of 2024, the company revealed that over 70% of buyers chose it. The percentage is much lower in Europe, though, where buyers prefer to pay more to also own the battery pack and not have to pay the monthly fee.

Nissan-Honda Seek Merger Into 'Global Mobility Company' By 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/745364/nissan-honda-merger-cm-2026/,"It's happening. Honda is riding to Nissan's rescue as planned, and it has huge implications for EVs, motorcycles, software and more.",12/23/2024 10:16,"The era of consolidation has fully arrived for the automotive industry, and we have electric vehicles to thank.
Granted, that era almost certainly kicked off a few years ago when Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA Group combined into Stellantis. And even before that, the now-late CEO of Fiat Chrysler warned that consolidation was the only way that car companies could survive the immense technological challenges ahead—electrification, autonomous vehicles and so on—without spending themselves into oblivion. But I'd argue the loudest bell has just been rung by Honda and Nissan, whose merger plans are now officially underway. Make no mistake: this is a big deal, and it says a lot about where the car business is going next.
That's the focus of today's Critical Materials, our morning roundup of technology and ""mobility industry"" news. Also on deck: smaller and more affordable vehicles are coming back, and a theory about Tesla CEO's latest moves in Washington, D.C. Let's dig in.
Honda Nissan Mitsubishi CEOs
A mere week after a report in Nikkei Asia indicated Honda and Nissan were considering merging into one company, talks between the two automakers officially kicked off in Japan today. ""Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (""Nissan"") and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (""Honda"") have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to start discussions and considerations toward a business integration between the two companies through the establishment of a joint holding company,"" the two said in a joint news release.
That was certainly quick. But it's probably because Nissan is running out of time. We've covered this company's many problems in the past so I won't recap them in their entirety here, but just recently, its own executives said it had about 12 to 14 months to survive before it would need some kind of restructuring. Enter Honda, a much more profitable and successful company riding to the rescue of one that's been lagging technologically and declining in sales for more than half a decade. And the Japanese government may have pushed the two into action after Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn reportedly eyed acquiring some or all of Nissan—an outcome that the country assuredly wouldn't want.
So how might this work? Here are the highlights, according to their statements today:
And then there's Mitsubishi. In a separate statement, the smaller company—itself a part of the Nissan-Renault Alliance—is part of discussions now about ""the possibility of achieving synergies at an increased level through Mitsubishi Motors’ participation or involvement in the business integration."" Those discussions are set to begin by the end of January, so it's very possible we could see news next year of this merger including three companies instead of two.
So besides Nissan's troubles, why is this happening? Because the future—electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, AI, connected software tech and more—will be tremendously expensive to deliver. It's a sea change for a car industry that spent 100 years making internal combustion vehicles, largely by assembling parts from disparate networks of supplier companies.
But the future is more like what Tesla and the Chinese automakers are doing: it's vertically integrated and focused on technology. And Japan's automakers are sorely behind the rising Chinese power players. They either have to team up to fight together, or become totally irrelevant.
Yet this merger presents a new set of problems. For one, Honda and Nissan have radically different company cultures; one is led by the engineers, the other by the sales and finance guys. And there's no guarantee that their combined resources will let them catch up quickly enough.
Finally, there's the question of whether these mergers are really beneficial or not. The Volkswagen Group and Stellantis have tremendous scale between them, but both conglomerates have had disastrous years in Europe and abroad. Perhaps Nissan-Honda-Mitsubishi's focus being on Japan, Asia and the U.S. will help avoid the disparate challenges the other two giants deal with. But becoming the world's third-largest automaker will not fix their mutual problems overnight.
Make no mistake: this merger, and how it plays out, will be one of the decade's most defining transportation stories.
2026 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Rendering Rear
I just spent the week driving a rented Tesla Model 3 Highland around Texas to see family over the holidays, and I was lamenting how the highest-range, most efficient EVs are always smaller cars and sedans—you know, the stuff Americans don't want to buy because we're so obsessed with big SUVs and trucks. But a trend that we've covered before has emerged even more clearly as the year wraps up: American buyers are starting to gravitate more to smaller vehicles now.
Above all, you can blame high prices for this change. Here's the Wall Street Journal:
Sales of some smaller, entry-level models, such as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, have taken off this year, rising 23% or more through November, according to research firm Motor Intelligence. Those increases have far outpaced the industry’s growth, which has been in the low single digits this year.
Meanwhile, large pickup truck sales, long a highly profitable corner of the market for the Detroit car companies, slid 1.9%, data from car-shopping website Edmunds shows. Sales of midsize SUVs, the type of vehicle typically favored by families, have also declined, falling 2.3% over 2023.
This rising interest in smaller offerings comes as owning a car has become increasingly unaffordable. The average selling price of a new car is still at historically high levels, exceeding $45,000 in November, according to J.D. Power. Insurance premiums, financing rates and repair costs have also climbed in recent years, further stretching household budgets.
As expenses have ticked higher, some buyers have become more willing to make a trade-off, sacrificing size and space for a lower monthly payment, analysts say.
“They need the functionality that the vehicle has, but they just need to buy the smaller size,” said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive. “It fits into their wallet.”
If you're a fan of smaller cars, there are some really positive signs here. The Mazda 3, which is objectively excellent (it's what I drive when I'm not in our Kia EV6) has seen double-digit sales gains this year. Compact and subcompact SUV sales are up 12% this year, as people still want that extra ride height and capability without going too large. And the Chevrolet Trax, which is finally a pretty good car and can be had in the $20,000 range, saw sales jump 89% in November alone.
So what does this mean for the electric market? I think it vindicates trends we've seen there as well: more buyers want affordable options and they're not interested in huge, luxury EVs with staggering price tags. It's why Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y hold the line so well, why the Chevy Equinox EV is doing so well and why there's so much hype around the new Chevy Bolt EUV due out next year.
People are sick of expensive cars after the pandemic sent everything into a tailspin. That should soon lead to a more attainable electric sector too, hopefully.
Elon Musk Dark Top
Meanwhile, in Washington, Congress has averted a government shutdown right before the holidays after passing a stopgap funding bill. But the U.S. came very close to that after Tesla CEO Elon Musk—who's now deeply involved with the incoming Trump Administration in a vague, unofficial capacity—stirred the pot on X to get lawmakers to kill it.
Why would Musk get so involved in this particular issue? Well, CNBC reports that House Democrats are accusing Musk of intervening to protect his Chinese interests, which could've been threatened if the original spending bill had been passed:
House Democrats Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut say their Republican colleagues in Congress caved to the demands of Elon Musk, sinking a bipartisan government funding bill that would have regulated U.S. investments in China.
The scrapped provision “would have made it easier to keep cutting-edge AI and quantum computing tech — as well as jobs — in America,” he wrote. “But Elon had a problem.”
Tesla, run by Musk, is the only foreign automaker to operate a factory in China without a local joint venture. Tesla also built a battery plant down the street from its Shanghai car factory this year, and aims to develop and sell self-driving vehicle technology in China.
“His bottom line depends on staying in China’s good graces,” McGovern wrote about Musk. “He wants to build an AI data center there too — which could endanger U.S. security. He’s been bending over backwards to ingratiate himself with Chinese leaders.”
Musk responded by calling DeLauro an ""awful creature"" on X. Anyway, we'll soon see how long Musk's relationship with Trump lasts if the CEO keeps taking the limelight from the incoming president. But as long as he does have influence in the new White House, expect it to be used accordingly.
VW XPeng
Toyota-Mazda-Subaru? Volkswagen-Xpeng-Rivian? General Motors acquires Jeep, Dodge and Ram from an ailing Stellantis? I don't think we've seen the last of Honda-Nissan-style power mergers. Where do you see this going next?

The 2025 Subaru Solterra Got A Big Price Cut,https://insideevs.com/news/745297/2025-subaru-solterra-ev-price-decrease/,"Subaru’s only electric model in the United States will be up to $7,000 less expensive starting next year.",12/23/2024 3:18,"The 2025 Subaru Solterra will be up to $7,000 less expensive than the outgoing model when it reaches dealerships in the United States early next year. It’s a significant price cut, but that’s about everything customers will get for the new model year, as there are precisely zero new features.
That said, the 2025 Solterra gets a new, top-of-the-line trim level called the Touring Onyx Edition, which comes with gloss black wheels and gloss black exterior and interior accents. This is the most expensive version of the Solterra, with an MSRP of $46,915 including destination.
On the other side of the list, there’s the 2025 Subaru Solterra Premium, which starts at $39,915, $6,500 less than the outgoing model. It comes as standard with dual-motor all-wheel drive, roof rails, 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels, an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone climate control and a pretty long list of advanced driver assistance features. These include Emergency Steering Assist, Lane Departure Prevention, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control and Hands-Free Low-Speed Driving.
More Stuff Like This
Next is the 2025 Solterra Limited, which retails for $43,415. Again, this gets a $6,500 cut compared to the 2024 model year. On top of what the Premium trim offers, the Limited comes with a 12.3-inch central infotainment display, a Harman Kardon audio system with 11 speakers, a 360-degree camera system, 20-inch allow wheels, 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat, 8-way power-adjustable passenger’s seat, heated rear seats, power rear liftgate, rain-sensing wipers, a wireless smartphone charger, a heated steering wheel and LED fog lights.
For $46,415, the 2025 Subaru Solterra Touring adds a panoramic glass roof with power sunshade, front and rear LED footwell lighting, heated and ventilated seats, a digital rearview mirror with Homelink and camera washer, as well as smart key access on all five doors. The 2025 Solterra Touring is $7,000 cheaper than the 2024 model year.
The list is completed by the Solterra Touring Onyx Edition–new for 2025–which costs $46,916 including destination. It adds a high-gloss black underguard, 20-inch wheels finished in black, black roof pillars, shoulder line trim, door frame, rear quarter window and roof spoiler, and black badging. Inside, black trim accents are installed on the front and rear doors, as well as on the seat upholstery.
The Solterra's EPA range rating and charging specs remain unchanged. Subaru's sole EV can go up to 227 miles on a full charge, and recharging it from 10% to 80% state of charge on a DC fast charger takes 35 minutes. The maximum DC charging speed is 100 kilowatts.
The Subaru Solterra is based on the Toyota bZ4X, which also got a significant price cut in the U.S. for the 2025 model year. Both are built in the same Toyota factory in Japan.",Iulian Dnistran
This Tesla Plaid-Powered Cobra Is Absurdly Quick,https://insideevs.com/news/745270/cobra-tesla-plaid-ev-conversion/,"With over 1,000 horsepower, all-wheel drive and about 1,450 fewer pounds to lug around, this thing is a rocket.",12/22/2024 14:00,"While there are many EV conversions that feature Tesla drive units and battery modules, there are hardly any that feature the bonkers three-motor Plaid powertrain with 1,060 horsepower. This lengthened and widened Cobra kit car is one of them, and it’s pretty bonkers.
The car needed to be bigger to fit the 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack out of a Model S Plaid and its three motors. You can see how much metal was added since it’s not painted, and the car looks about two feet longer than standard as well as about 10 inches wider. The longer wheelbase and wider track should also help improve comfort, stability at high speeds and the predictability of the handling while driving the car spiritedly.
It has Plaid front and rear subframes, so the wheels still stick out even though the body has been widened. The wheelbase appears to be a bit shorter than a Model S Plaid’s.
The vehicle was built by Don Swadley, who used a special custom controller created by Ingenext that makes the powertrain work. The result is impressive and, frankly, a bit scary too. We’d love to see this on a drag strip to see how it compares with the world’s quickest-accelerating vehicles.
Weighing around 3,300 pounds, it’s considerably lighter than a Model S Plaid, which weighs nearly 4,800 pounds. That’s an almost 1,500-pound difference, which explains why the acceleration looks so scary in the driving video posted by Revolt Systems. It shows the car not only accelerating from a standstill and pinning the occupants to their seats even under partial throttle but also how all four tires lose traction even when you floor it at higher speeds.
This Cobra is lighter and should, therefore, be even quicker than the Dodge Challenger Hellcat Plaid swap we featured last month.
The car has fully slick tires, whose grip on an unprepared surface and, when not up to temperature, can vary greatly. Even with all-wheel drive and sticky tires, though, this is still a pretty scary EV conversion, although if you take it to a drag strip with a grippier surface, it should catapult itself off the line and easily beat a Model S Plaid.

Production Of Fiat And Maserati EVs Will Stay Paused Over Slow Sales,https://www.motor1.com/news/745181/stellantis-pauses-maserati-fiat-production-again/,"Stellantis is extending the Fiat 500e production stoppage until January 20, while Maserati EV production is paused until February 3.",12/25/2024 1:24,"Fiat won’t be building any new 500es anytime soon. Stellantis has extended the shutdown at the factory where it assembles the little electric vehicle until January 20. The automaker had announced late last month that it would pause production at its Mirafiori factory in Italy until January 5.
The new extended shutdown also includes the Maserati GranTurismo and GrabCabrio that Stellantis also builds at the plant. However, according to the Reuters report, the automaker won’t restart producing those two models until February 3.
Stellantis has paused production at the factory before, including twice late last year in September and again in October. Electric vehicles just aren't selling as well as automakers had planned, and automakers are now curtailing EV production while reconsidering their electrification efforts.
CEO Carlos Tavares had previously blamed bad marketing for Maserati’s woes, but Stellantis has since parted ways with the CEO. There was disagreement between Tavares and the board about the automaker’s direction, leading to his sudden resignation at the beginning of the month.
Interestingly, abysmal EV sales have been a boon for consumers looking for cheap leases. Falling demand is leaving dealers with a lot of inventory they’re eager to move. One dealer in Colorado is currently offering a $0-a-month lease on the new 500e, leaning generous federal and state incentives to give consumers excellent deals.

Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,12/25/2024 1:24,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

"Tesla Wanted $3,000 To Fix A Dented Cybertruck. The Owner Fixed It For $25",https://insideevs.com/news/744851/tesla-cybertruck-diy-dent-removal-video/,Being resourceful has its advantages.,12/21/2024 10:00,"The Tesla Cybertruck is advertised as being dent-proof, rust-proof and even bulletproof. It all sounds very good, and it’s some very good marketing on Tesla’s side, but it’s not exactly true, as some owners found out the hard way. (Please don’t shoot your own car.)
That said, there are benefits to owning an unpainted car that’s covered in stainless steel panels, as one Cybertruck owner from Detroit found out after another vehicle dented the driver-side door of his electric pickup just a few weeks after getting delivery.
The ding was on the lower part of the door on the factory crease that extends to the rear wheels. Naturally, this being a brand-new car, the owner went to a Tesla collision center to get a quote for the repair. The estimate was a pretty hefty $3,000, with $828 for a new door panel and the rest in labor.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Unfazed by the potential repair costs, the owner went home and tried to fix the ding with the help of a friend. The first attempt was with a sturdy suction cup, but it wouldn’t stay attached to the body panel and the dent was still there.
The next step was to heat the steel panel and then stick some glue sticks on the damaged area. The sticks were simply pulled by hand. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t work either.
However, a second try with the suction cup on a warm panel resulted in a definite fix, which was very satisfying to watch, as you can see in the video embedded above. The “pop” of the metal returning to its original form is nothing but bliss for people who like working on their own cars (this news writer included).
The cost? Chump change compared to the Tesla collision center estimate: a $25 lunch for the owner’s buddy who did all the work.",Iulian Dnistran
Electric Car Charging Etiquette Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/745023/electric-car-ev-charging-etiquette/,InsideEVs has compiled five key tips to make sure all EV drivers have hassle-free charging sessions.,12/20/2024 13:30,"Electric cars are rapidly taking over the streets. Recently, you might have passed a Tesla Model Y cruising down the highway or seen a family unloading their gear from a Honda Prologue by the soccer field. They're everywhere. But there is one significant effect: more cars than ever need to get plugged in.
If you've charged in a busy urban area, you might have encountered full or over-capacity chargers. This means that drivers must be familiar with the proper etiquette to ensure swift and courteous charging sessions. Like the rules of the road, there are rules to charging. InsideEVs has compiled five key tips to make sure all EV drivers have hassle-free charging sessions.
More On Charging
The cardinal rule of charging an electric car on a public charger is to plug in. This rule applies to all chargers, but primarily level 2 stations at work, hotels, or shopping centers. Namely, if you're in a charging spot, plug in. If your car is at a high enough state of charge where it doesn't need to be plugged in, then you should find a regular parking spot.
The charging spots are there for vehicles to charge, not for people's cars to occupy. 'ICE'ing' is a term used to describe an internal combustion engine-powered car that is intentionally parked in an EV spot. It's annoying and inconsiderate when this happens. But in the case of an EV not plugging in, it's the exact same scenario. There's a vehicle blocking other people's access to the charger.
With the influx of EVs on the road, charging spots are more likely to be occupied. And some people rely on these chargers for their daily travels. Therefore, if you see an open charging spot and need a charge, plug in!
As an extension of the first rule, you should always leave a charging spot once a session is complete. When your car has completed charging, the spot should be vacated to allow others to charge. Especially at hotels, many EV drivers have likely planned their trip to account for an overnight charging stop. Therefore, if your car is done charging at ten at night, the courteous thing to do would be to unplug and find a different spot.
Most DC fast charging stations have idle fees, meaning you will receive a bill if your car is done charging and still plugged in. Tesla charges an idle fee of up to $1.00 a minute, depending on station business. Therefore, if your car has completed its charging session, it's time to find somewhere else to park.
While every electric car on the market features different charging profiles, generally, they charge faster at lower states of charge. This means that when road-tripping, it is sometimes more time-efficient to ""bottom charge"" your car. For instance, the Model Y takes around 33 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent. But it takes 30 more minutes to go from 80 to 100. In other words, if the next charging stop isn't far away, it's not worth waiting to ""top charge"" the battery.
Some drivers have EVs that come with free charging subscriptions. BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen (not anymore), and Hyundai are a few automakers that supply their electric cars with unlimited 30-minute charging sessions on Electrify America. While free charging is undoubtedly a perk, some drivers like to fully maximize the offer by charging from, say, 60 to 100% while they're shopping.
While there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of an offer, one should be cognizant of others in line. If you're road-tripping, pulling in at 10 percent, and waiting for an ID.4 to reach 100%, you may not be a happy camper.
While Tesla opening up the Supercharging network to other makes and models is a big deal, there's one big caveat. A lot of EVs on the market have their charge ports in different locations. All Ford and most GM EVs feature charging ports on the driver's side front quarter panel. Meanwhile, BMW's electric cars bestow their ports on the passenger side rear.
On the other hand, Tesla's lineup has the charging port positioned on the driver's side rear. Since Tesla developed the charger and vehicle simultaneously, the engineers designed the cable to be just long enough to accommodate the port location. Shorter cables mean less coolant is needed, lessened electrical resistance, and a smaller bill of materials (particularly less copper).
Tesla Ford NACS Supercharger Double Park
Depending on the station design, shorter cables might have trouble reaching all cars. Pull-through Superchargers should pose no serious issues, though the traditional parking-space style ones might. To charge a Chevrolet Equinox EV on a Supercharger, occupying more than one spot might be necessary.
Simply put, if you're in a busy region, taking up multiple supercharging spots might block another driver's access to a stall. Tesla recommends not parking perpendicular to the spot lines, as that would block three stalls. Instead, drivers must straddle the dividing lines for the front charge port to come close enough to the cable. End spots are obviously the most desirable, though taking up two spots is the temporary solution for now.
Tesla's 4th generation Superchargers will have longer cables, so this issue is isolated with previous generation stations.
Unfortunately, queuing at charging stations is a bit of an issue. If you arrive at a full charging station in a busy spot, the best method is to park in a spot opposite the stalls. Therefore, you can see the cars entering and exiting. If there isn't a lot of parking lot traffic and it's safe, then it's usually all right to park in the lot facing the chargers. This way, other arriving drivers know that you were there first.
Finally, once you've been queuing and get on a charger, it's recommended not to stay at the station unnecessarily long. If there's a long line, and the next charger on your trip is less busy, you should charge as much as you need to get there with a buffer. This will help get people in and out of the station and on their way.
The electric car community is rapidly evolving, with more members than ever. However, proper etiquette is needed to ensure everyone can get to their destinations quickly and seamlessly. This means that drivers must be conscious of their time at stations.
But the best way is education. If you meet a new driver at a station, tell him or her about how charging works. Let that person know about the different types of charging stations or what charging curves are. Driving electric demands a learning curve, so keeping other drivers up to speed is good for everyone.",Andrew Lambrecht
'It’s A Desperate Move': Ex-Nissan Boss Carlos Ghosn On Honda Merger,https://insideevs.com/news/745166/carlos-ghosn-honda-nissan-cm/,"The former Nissan-Renault chief isn't staying quiet about the former's potential merger with Honda. Plus: a Tesla recall, and Cybercabs in Austin?",12/20/2024 10:04,"Carlos Ghosn was never one to pull his punches. Even at the peak of his power at the helm of one of the world's largest automakers, he always had a lot to say. So following his daring escape from Japanese prosecution for alleged financial crimes, nobody should have expected the former Nissan-Renault boss in exile to just chill on a yacht somewhere. (Well, he had one, but he had to give it back.)
Now, Ghosn is back in the public eye to weigh in on Nissan's potential merger with Honda, and he hasn't lost his fiery touch. That kicks off this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and tech news. Also on tap: a Tesla recall that you should know about (but one of the over-the-air sort,) and possible news about a Tesla Cybercab deployment in Austin. Let's dig in.
You may not care what Ghosn has to say about Nissan—or anything—anymore, especially since he hasn't been involved with the automaker since his 2018 arrest in Japan and subsequent flight from prosecution about a year after that. But I'd argue few people on earth know Nissan like Ghosn does. And few people know about mergers to save Nissan like Ghosn does.
After all, Ghosn was a top executive at Renault in 1999 when it formed the Nissan-Renault Alliance, an odd cross-continental team-up that rescued Nissan was on the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan's problems back then should sound familiar: an unsustainable focus on volume, forgettable models, a hangover from a financial crisis, and so on. He would soon lead both companies to a surprising degree of financial and sales success until his downfall.
Now, Nissan is in crisis again. It's the poster child for how far behind the Japanese auto industry is technologically, and for how much ground it's losing to new, high-tech players in China. Japan Inc. needs capital and expertise to deliver a future focused on batteries and software, and Honda—despite being in much better shape these days—has been called up on to help make that happen. Merger talks could start as soon as Monday, according to reports.
But Ghosn told Bloomberg he doesn't see the point:
“It’s a desperate move,” Ghosn said Friday on Bloomberg Television. “It’s not a pragmatic deal because frankly, the synergies between the two companies are difficult to find.”
Nissan and Honda operate in the same markets with similar brands and products, Ghosn said, casting doubt on the merits of the two combining. He believes Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has pushed Honda to go forward with a deal.
“They’re trying to figure out something that could marry the short-term problems of Nissan and the long-term vision of Honda,” Ghosn said. While there is “no industrial logic” to a deal, “there is a moment where you have to choose between performance and control.”
It's also worth noting here that Ghosn is hardly some benevolent, unbiased actor. He has maintained both his innocence and a huge axe to grind against Nissan since his departure, and has spent the years since railing against the automaker's management and failures in the marketplace.
But he's right that synergies are hard to find here—in Nissan and Renault's case, the alliance was a tight partnership between two giants that often operated in very different markets and wasn't an outright merger. (Neither Japan nor the French government, which partially owns Renault, ever seemed good with that.) But Honda and Nissan are direct competitors basically everywhere and in every segment. How does this make sense for Honda, in particular?
Ghosn also addressed the reports that this merger was prompted by interest in Nissan from Taiwanese electronics giant (and iPhone manufacturer) Foxconn, which has wanted to get into the carmaking game for some time. The current thinking by many industry watchers is the Japanese government is moving this along to protect some of its most important companies from foreign control. But Ghosn warned Foxconn will be back, somewhere:
“I can understand that a company like Foxconn — headed by very serious and realistic management — is going to say, ‘You know what, instead of us investing to do our own electric car, let’s buy a car company,” Ghosn said. “They’re not going to be the only one to try to do that.”
We'll know more as this reportedly starts to play out next week.
Tesla Model Y Tire
Hey, Tesla owners: you may own one of the 700,000 models affected by a new recall. Luckily, this one's an over-the-air update. Here's what to know from the Associated Press:
According to a letter Thursday from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall includes certain 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3, and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles.
The issue is that the tire pressure monitoring system warning light on the vehicles may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure. Driving with improperly inflated tires can increase the risk of a crash.
Are OTA updates ""recalls""? I say if they fix a problem, I have no issue with that phrasing.
Tesla Cybercab, LA Auto Show 2024
It's not uncommon to see Google's Waymo driverless cars zooming around tech-crazed Austin these days. But if Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets his way, Austin could eventually see Tesla Cybercabs on its roads too. Here's one more from Bloomberg:
Emails acquired by Bloomberg through public records requests show a Tesla employee has been communicating with the city of Austin’s autonomous vehicle task force since at least May to establish safety expectations for the vehicles as the company decides if Austin will be the first Texas city where Tesla deploys driverless fleets.
“Tesla is still working to strategically find a city within Texas to deploy... The city of Austin is obviously on our roadmap, but has not yet been decided where we will deploy first as we have many options available,” a November email from the employee said.
A successful rollout is key to Tesla as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has increasingly bet the company’s future on autonomous technology and robotaxis, but the needed approvals could be years away. A number of competitors have already deployed driverless cars on public roads in select cities.
But Austin's own mayor has been a critic of the technology too, and as the story notes, Texas isn't necessarily the regulatory free-for-all that you might expect it to be:
In Texas, where autonomous vehicles are regulated much like any other car and cities do not set regulations, Tesla will face few regulatory hurdles. Companies must have insurance, be able to follow traffic laws and be equipped with video recording devices. Robotaxis must have their own licensing, and the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation has yet to list Tesla as a licensee.
Still, testing the Cybercabs—which will controversially rely on cameras and AI instead of Lidar and other advanced sensor suites like Waymo's cars—in the warm-weather home of Tesla makes a lot of sense for the company. I would not be shocked at all if testing begins there as early as next year.

You may live with them already if you're in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco or Austin. Are you fine with them being in your town, or coming to them eventually? What safeguards would you want if they were to hit your streets?

Porsche Is Struggling With Electric 718 Boxster Development: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/744790/porsche-718-electric-development-problems/,Battery issues could delay the next Cayman as well.,12/25/2024 1:24,"Already discontinued in Europe because of cybersecurity regulations, the current-generation Porsche 718 is not long for this world. The gasoline-fueled Boxster and Cayman duo will be discontinued globally by next year. What comes after? An all-electric sports car. However, there's reportedly a possibility of a gap between when the ICE dies and when the EV indirectly takes its place in the lineup.
Automobilwoche, the German branch of Automotive News Europe, claims Porsche is having problems developing the 718 EV. The engineers from Zuffenhausen are apparently ""well behind schedule,"" so there's a real risk the electric sports car's launch could be delayed. The mid-mounted battery is believed to be the culprit, with Porsche ""constantly requesting adjustments"" from supplier Valmet Automotive.
The Finnish company is doing as asked, but it's incurring additional costs that Porsche allegedly doesn't want to pay or only partially covers. Based on our oldest spy shots, the electric 718 has been undergoing testing for at least two years. Nevertheless, it's increasingly likely that the Boxster and Cayman without a combustion engine will not be ready for primetime in 2025 to supersede the gas cars swiftly.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg. According to Automobilwoche, the next-gen, electric-only Cayenne could also be delayed from its original programmed debut in 2026. Porsche has already stopped chasing its lofty goal of having EVs account for 80% of annual sales by 2030. In addition, the German luxury brand has pledged to keep the V-8 engine well into the next decade.
The report mentions that the Panamera could get a next-generation model with combustion engines, given the company's current slowdown in electric sales. Taycan deliveries were down 50% globally through September. On a more positive note, the 911 is said to continue with gas engines into the 2030s. On numerous occasions, Porsche has said the 911 will be its final ICE car.
Elsewhere, the large electric SUV known internally as the ""K1"" could be pushed back by a few years. Alternatively, Porsche is reportedly considering extending the Cayenne's platform for a three-row SUV with gas engines since the Volkswagen Group Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) doesn't support conventional powertrains. Last month, the Chief Financial Officer, Lutz Meschke, admitted that future models that were supposed to be electric-only could get gas engines:
""We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""
Porsche is in a delicate situation. The next-gen Macan was supposed to be released about two years ago, but software glitches prevented the electric crossover from being released on time. It's now finally out. To make matters worse, the ICE version—which has always been among the firm's top sellers—will be phased out worldwide in 2026. It has already been axed in Europe due to the same cybersecurity regulations that killed the 718.
As if that wasn't bad enough, demand in China has collapsed this year, with deliveries falling by nearly 30% in the first nine months.
We've reached out for a comment from Porsche. The article will be updated if we hear back.

Tesla Sales Are Tanking In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/745119/tesla-sales-europe-2024/,"Eleven months into 2024, Tesla is seeing a double-digit decrease in registrations.",12/20/2024 4:15,"Europe is experiencing some weird times. From politics to economy and car sales, it’s far from rosy, and arguably the biggest player in the electric vehicle game is having a rough year.
Eleven months into 2024, Tesla recorded a double-digit decrease in registrations, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which released official figures for November.
To be clear, Tesla is still one of the largest EV manufacturers in Europe and the United States, but its grip is weakening on the other side of the Atlantic. Last month, Tesla recorded a 40.9% decrease in registrations in the European Union compared to the same month last year. The number of registrations went from 31,810 in November 2023 to 18,786 last month, marking a decrease in market share from 3.6% to 2.2%.
More Sales Stories
Year-to-date, Tesla had 211,405 registrations in the EU, 15.2% fewer than last year’s 249,265 units.
It’s a similar story when the European Free Trade Association members and the United Kingdom are included in the mix. EFTA members include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On these markets, Tesla registrations went down 28.4% in November, from 36,563 units last year to 26,191 units this year, which made the American automaker’s market share go down from 3.4% to 2.5%.
Year-to-date, Tesla registrations in the EU, EFTA and UK went down 13.7% from 327,635 units in 2023 to 282,692 units this year, while the market share shrunk from 2.8% to 2.4%. In the EU alone, which has 27 member states, Tesla’s market share went down from 2.6% in the first 11 months of last year to 2.2% this year.
The automaker’s losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasingly controversial attitude of its CEO, Elon Musk, and the decrease in government incentives. Some European states have reduced the amount of money offered toward the purchase of a new EV, while others have eliminated the incentives altogether.
That said, Tesla’s significant drop in European registrations has largely left the EV industry unaffected. Considering the sheer volume of electric cars sold by Tesla, EV registrations as a whole only went down by 1.4% in the EU, EFTA and UK from January to November and they actually went up 0.9% in November compared to last year. In the EU alone, EV registrations went down 5.4% year-to-date and 9.5% in November.
This can only mean one thing: other automakers have stepped up to try and fill the gap left by Tesla, and customers are following suit.",Iulian Dnistran
"Rivian Has Delivered Over 20,000 Electric Vans To Amazon So Far",https://insideevs.com/news/745106/rivian-amazon-edv-delivery-update/,Amazon’s Rivian EDV fleet in the U.S. has increased by roughly 33% in four months.,12/20/2024 3:17,"American e-commerce giant Amazon now has over 20,000 Rivian Electric Delivery Vans (EDVs) making deliveries across the United States. This year, the American-made commercial EVs have delivered over one billion packages for Amazon.
The previous fleet update came at the beginning of August when Amazon said Rivian had delivered 15,000 EDVs. At the end of November, the e-commerce giant said its Rivian commercial van fleet has expanded to over 20,000 units, but many more are yet to come.
Amazon and Rivian struck a deal in 2019 to put 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road by 2030. The first Amazon-branded EVs were delivered in the summer of 2022. In other words, roughly two and a half years were needed to produce 20,000 units, which comes out to approximately 700 units per month.
More Rivian Van Stuff
With five years left until the 2030 deadline, Rivian has a good shot at reaching its target if it keeps up the same production pace. In a previous email sent to InsideEVs, the company said it remains on track to deliver on its EDV commitments.
Roughly 300 Rivian-made Amazon Electric Delivery Vans were sent to Germany, but the vast majority are shipping parcels in the United States in cities like Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Portland, San Diego and Seattle.
To keep the huge fleet of electric vans running, Amazon has installed over 17,000 chargers at more than 120 delivery centers throughout the country, making it the largest private charging operator in the world.
The Rivian-made electric commercial vehicle was designed exclusively for Amazon, but the exclusivity deal was shuttered last year when Rivian said anyone could buy its now-renamed Commercial Van or RCV. AT&T has a pilot program where it’s testing several RCVs and R1 EVs, and Canada Post has commissioned several custom-made delivery vans known as the Morgan Olson C250e, which is based on the Rivian ECV.",Iulian Dnistran
'Get Butts In Seats': Inside Dodge's Plan To Convert EV Skeptics,https://insideevs.com/news/745071/dodge-charger-ev-skeptics-roadkill/,"To win over the Mopar faithful, Dodge is about to lean on them actually experiencing the electric Charger Daytona.",12/19/2024 17:00,"Dodge, perhaps alone among contemporary automakers, has seen immense success in translating the archaic 20th-century Muscle Car formula into the 21st. It has done this by stuffing increasingly outrageous iterations of its modern Hemi V8 into nearly every vehicle in its product line. Its fervent Hellcat-ing has been enough, surprisingly, to maintain steadily vigorous sales of its Challenger coupe and Charger sedan, 20-year-old cars aping 55-year-old designs and riding on platforms developed more than 30 years ago.
But those vehicles are finally going away. They will be replaced by flexible-powertrain two- and four-door models, both called Charger, that will be motivated, at launch in early 2025, solely by a 100.5 kWh battery pack and a pair of electric motors. (And if you’re a Mopar nut but are committed to internal combustion, your muscle-car future means an inline-six engine, as if you were one of those guys whose entire wardrobe consists of ///M apparel. Can you imagine?) So how does Mopar’s methylized muscle-maker plan to convince potential consumers to buy into such a blasphemous switcheroo?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To get enthusiasts’ “butts-in-seats” and assist with this electron baptism, Dodge is planning a whole series of events in the upcoming year, said Matt McAlear, the brand’s CEO. It will take its new EV muscle cars on tour in the first quarter of 2025 to train its sales and dealership staff and demonstrate the vehicles’ capabilities. It is launching a courtesy transportation program wherein it will send EVs to dealers to use for short-term consumer test drives, or as 96-hour loaners when customers come in to have their vehicle serviced. It will host consumer-facing “Thrill Ride” drive events at upcoming Mecum and Barrett-Jackson classic car auctions, and at its drifting/drag racing “Roadkill Nights” live events in the summer–—prime sites for the gathering of Hemis of all vintages.
“Dodge is always best as a brand when it does something different,” McAlear said, referencing the automaker’s marketing slogan from the 1980s and 1990s, Dodge Different. And he’s certainly right about convincing people with actual seat time and not just ads. Study after study indicates that once people experience EVs for themselves, or hear from friends and family who do, they’re far more likely to pull the trigger themselves.
Plus, he said, this EV has the bona fides. “This vehicle, it's a muscle car first. If you look at the specs, the design, the capability, and take powertrain out of it, it’s a better muscle car on paper than the cars it replaces,” he noted. “So while there is a polarizing, controversial aspect to this—that it happens to have an EV powertrain as one of the powertrains that’s going to power it—no one can argue the battery electric technology enables terrific performance, and that's what we're bringing to market with this.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To enunciate this point, McAlear pointed out that even after Dodge introduces ICE-powered iterations of the Charger in the second half of 2025, gasoline power will represent “the entry-level vehicles from a performance standpoint.” So if a potential consumer desires a car with the quickest acceleration (0-60 in 3.3 seconds) they’ll learn that that capability is a battery-only option.
This powertrain rollout and hierarchy is a stated part of Dodge’s strategy for muscling the muscle car faithful toward EVs, according to McAlear. Another prong in this program is to focus on added utility and daily drivability, to create what Stellantis design chief Ralph Gilles called “emotional alibis” to lead consumers toward acceptance of this new product.
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear listed a suite of capabilities that can provide such cover for what amounts to a highly irrational and emotional purchase. “All-wheel-drive, for instance, helps us compete more in the North as a daily driver,” he said, referencing its all-weather capability. “A hidden hatchback capability gives you amazing cargo space that you didn’t have in your old vehicle. The new Charger two-door now has more rear-seat legroom than the outgoing four-door,” he said. “So this becomes much more of a daily driver than any of the muscle cars that we've had prior.”
Will this litany of added functionality convince Dodge die-hards, who will receive a defeatable synthetic exhaust note that is as boisterous as that of the outgoing car, but no scent of unburned fuel or ability to smoke the rear tires from a standstill?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
“Probably not immediately out of the gate,” McAlear said. “It's going to take some time. It's going to take them seeing one on the street. It's going to take them going in for service and testing one while they're getting an oil change. But I've seen those people get behind the wheel and come out with changed opinions.”
However, convincing the faithful may not be the ideal tactic for furthering this car’s market penetration. “Though a muscle car and an electric vehicle seem diametrically opposed, there is an opportunity for electrification to magnify the idea, benefits, and aspirational nature of the muscle car,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a Southern California automotive research and consulting firm. “However, the conversion of those from the past, I do not believe is the best strategy. Instead, a new generation of muscle cars can find success with younger folks who think they like muscle cars.”
As it turns out, Dodge has just such consumers in its targets. “If you look at our current demographic today, we have the youngest demographic in the mainstream auto industry,” said McAlear. “We have the highest percentage of Gen Z and Millennials. And those customers have the highest propensity to be willing to adopt electrification. So that sets us up.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Dodge might be onto something here. Though muscle car seems like an anachronistic category to anyone who isn’t a Boomer, research shows that these vehicles have and maintain broader appeal. “The interesting thing with those cars, I think, is they’re far more long-lived than cars like tri-five [1955-57] Chevys, or other American cars of the era,” said Brian Rabold, vice president of valuation for Hagerty, the world’s largest insurer of collectible vehicles. “There are a lot more entry points for younger generations to become interested in them—through driving video games, through movies like the Fast and Furious franchise.” As Rabold notes, pop cultural exposure conjures interest and desire, and translates into purchases, whether those be old Polaras and Road Runners, or more recent Fox Body Mustangs and fourth-gen Firebirds.
Still, rumors have persisted that interest in Dodge’s new muscular EV is less robust than the brand initially suspected and that it is thus rushing the inline-six-powered iterations to supplement this engagement. McAlear denies this categorically.
“That's what you call an urban legend,” he said. “Someone put one thing on the Internet. And if it's on the Internet, it's true, right?” He laughed, underlining his sarcasm. “We're always trying to bring every new vehicle to market as quickly as possible,” he continued. “It doesn't do us any good from an R&D and a capital expenditure standpoint to hold sales any longer than we have to. So nothing has changed with our timing.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Overall, once both powertrains are on the market, McAlear expects the mix of Charger buyers to segment about evenly: half electric, half gas. This aligns with Dodge’s current mix of high-test Hemi- versus lesser-powered Challengers and Chargers. “If we look historically at our V6 versus our performance V8, it was roughly 50/50,” McAlear said. “So I still think there's an opportunity, over time—as adoption continues to happen, and as infrastructure comes in across the U.S. in terms of charging capability—I think there's the ability for this [EV] to beat a 50/50 mix.” (Dodge officials declined to address questions about demand or pre-orders, but said they plan to remain flexible in terms of production based on consumer demand.)
If any marque is positioned to succeed with an electric muscle car, it seems to be Mopar’s performance brand. “Consumers who own the Charger and Challenger usually love their vehicles,” said Edwards, whose firm conducts hundreds of thousands of in-depth psychographic surveys with new car buyers annually. “Even those who never buy a Dodge can often agree that Dodge is an exciting brand that has a lot to offer. If Dodge takes the position that they are innovating excitement, then this next step could be a doorway for Dodge’s electric future.” He added one further provision. “They just have to get the messaging right.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear and his teams seem to be thinking about this carefully, calibrating their messaging to entice purchasers who may be simultaneously powertrain-aware and -agnostic. “People buy a muscle car for so much more than just what powers it. They buy it because of how it makes them feel. It's an extension of their personality. It puts a smile on their face. They have fun being in it. They have fun being seen it,” he said. “So I think that's what this vehicle does. And it opens this up to a much larger demographic and audience.”
After spending some time in the Daytona Charger EV, recently, I felt like it succeeded in charting a freshly charged path into the moribund world of muscle cars. So Dodge seemingly has the product right. And it has a history of creating memorable messaging.
We’ll see if it can find a magic recipe that yields results from a youthful audience open to this surprisingly compelling and venerable category.

MG Says Its 2025 Semi-Solid-State EV Won’t Break The Bank,https://insideevs.com/news/745068/mg-semi-solid-state-ev/,2025 is shaping up to be a big year for solid-state batteries in EVs and SAIC-owned MG wants to be at the forefront.,12/19/2024 16:00,"Solid-state batteries are a big buzzword on the electric vehicle scene these days because they promise to address many of the downsides of today’s EVs. Several automakers and specialized battery companies are working to make this groundbreaking technology financially viable for electric vehicles. Still, before true solid-state batteries reach a production car, we will likely first see semi-solid-state batteries implemented.
One automaker that plans to introduce a semi-solid-state is MG, according to CarNewsChina, which quotes local media sources. It says its new semi-solid-state model will offer great range and excellent charging performance. Semi-solid-state batteries are halfway between regular lithium-ion and solid-state batteries that do away with the former’s liquid or gel electrolyte in favor of a solid-state material.
China’s SAIC now owns MG and it makes all its cars in China. It plans to launch the new EV in 2025 and says the semi-solid state battery won’t raise the vehicle’s price. It will come standard and likely related to (or the same as) the pack in another SAIC-owned brand, IM Motors, which unveiled its semi-solid-state sedan earlier this year.
The IM L6 has a 133-kilowatt-hour semi-solid-state battery pack, giving it a claimed CLTC range of over 1,000 kilometers (623 miles). It’s built on an 800-volt platform and its maker says it can charge at 400 kilowatts, adding 400 km (249 miles) of range in 12 minutes.
However, unlike the IM L6, which gets the semi-solid-state battery as an option in the highest trim (you can also get it with two cheaper NMC packs), the MG derivative will be semi-solid-state-only. The L6 with the mid-tier NMC battery costs the equivalent of around $41,500, while the top “Lightyear Max” trim with the special battery costs $45,650.
More On This
This gives us an idea of what MG could charge for its semi-solid-state EV. If it’s competitively priced to compete with rivals from Volkswagen, Hyundai or Tesla but offers more range and faster charging, it could prove very successful. MG is already doing great in Europe thanks to the MG4 EV, a VW ID.3 rival offering more performance at a very attractive price.
However, people may be wary of buying a vehicle with battery technology whose durability and longevity have not been proven, although the financial proposition will also play a determining role. The new electric MG will be revealed in the first part of 2025 and will go on sale before the end of the year.",Andrei Nedelea
"Chevy Equinox EV: How To Get One Under $30,000",https://insideevs.com/news/745048/chevy-equinox-ev-lt-deals/,"Considering the incentives that both dealers and GM are offering, the Equinox EV is incredibly affordable.",12/19/2024 14:00,"The Chevrolet Equinox EV is a very important electric car. It’s so important that InsideEVs has chosen it as our inaugural “Breakthrough EV Of The Year.” While the electric Equinox offers sleek styling and impressive range, its best attribute is its price point.
Starting at $34,995 in base LT form, the Equinox EV offers what's probably the best range-to-price ratio in the entire industry right now. For example,  the Equinox EV undercuts the Volkswagen ID.4’s $41,160 sticker price by $6,165. Yet, the Equinox can travel 113 additional EPA-rated miles. Add in the EV tax credit and the price drops as low as $27,495. But that’s not all.
2024 Chevy Equinox EV RS AWD
If you currently own or lease a 2010 or newer non-GM vehicle, you will be able to get an additional $1,500 off the purchase or lease of a new Equinox EV. Prospective owners who have a Costco membership are able to shave another $1,000 off the MSRP of the car. Since these offers can be stacked, a Costco member with, say, a 2018 Tesla Model 3 will pay just $24,995 for a new model.
But there are ways to get into an Equinox EV for even less. We’ve seen several U.S. dealerships advertising new 2025 Equinox EV LTs with steep discounts, like this one in Michigan selling a car for $29,040. Add in the tax credits and you’re potentially looking at a new, high-range EV for around $23,000 after taxes and dealer fees.
Now, you need to make sure the advertised offer is what the dealer is actually going to honor, but the point is that we’re seeing Equinox EVs at prices far lower than expected as 2024 winds to a close. (Additionally, the Equinox EV lineup was simplified for 2025, so the one you want for a cheap deal is the 2025 Equinox EV LT.)
There’s no doubt the Equinox EV is a compelling case on paper. But all this begs the question: with these ultra-low prices, is now the time to buy an electric Equinox?
The Chevrolet Equinox EV’s most impressive attribute is its range. All Equinox EV variants come with an 85.0 kilowatt-hour usable battery pack. The base front-wheel-drive version can travel 319 miles on a charge and the $40,295 all-wheel-drive can manage a respectable 307 miles. Our own Tom Moloughney recorded 303 miles of range at 70-mph in the front-drive version. The FWD model creates 213 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque. The AWD manages 288 horsepower and 333 pound-feet.
2024 Chevy Equinox EV RS AWD
While the power is okay, there’s one big limitation: the weight. The front motor Equinox EV weighs 4,923 pounds and the all-wheel-drive tips the scales at 5,073 pounds. This makes the Equinox EV one of the heaviest non-luxury electric crossovers on the road. The omnipresent Model Y, which manages 320 miles of range, weighs 4,154, a far cry from the Equinox EV. This weight takes a hit on performance. The FWD can accelerate to sixty in 8.0 seconds and the AWD can accomplish a more venerable 5.9 seconds.
Nevertheless, consumers purchasing an affordable electric crossover probably don’t care about performance and weight, but they do care about charging. The Equinox EV comes as standard with an 11.5-kilowatt (48 amp) onboard charger, allowing for a Level 2 charge time of just 7.5 hours. On the AWD RS trim, Chevrolet offers a $1,295 onboard charger that can accept 80 amps or 19.2 kilowatts. This drops the charge time to just 4.5 hours.
Chevrolet Equinox EV charging inlet
While it charges fast enough on a Level 2 plug, its DC fast charging capabilities are just okay. Tom recorded a 20 to 80% charge time of 34 minutes, which is not groundbreaking. For comparison, the Kia EV6 crossover can manage 20 to 80% in just 17 minutes, thanks to its incredibly high-voltage battery pack. It’s not bad, but doable—and miles better than the recently discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV.
When it comes to trims and options, the Equinox EV is one of the weirdest vehicles in Chevrolet’s lineup. The base LT version comes low on features, what you’d expect for a car with a low price point. The entry-level Equinox offers a light dusting of features including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, a 17.7-inch display, cloth seats, and a six-speaker sound system. But the option packages get a bit confusing.
Equinox EV LT Interior
GM offers a $1,455 Comfort Package and a $545 Active Safety Package, though these must be added together. Therefore, the $2,000 combined package comes with a 360-degree camera, traffic sign recognition, heated front seats, a power driver's seat, and a heated leather steering wheel. But then there's an $8,300 Convenience Package. It comes with ambient lighting, trailer hitch guidance, auto-dimming mirrors, a wireless phone charger, a power liftgate, and a front LED lightbar.
Even more odd is the $11,400 Convenience Package II, which comes with 21-inch wheels, dual zone climate controls, a head-up display, heated rear seats, venilated front leatherette seats, and memory seat functionality. Drivers can choose either the Convenience I or II package. Nevertheless, the Convenience Package II costs a staggering 33.9% of the car’s MSRP. Supercruise hardware is available for $3,355 with 3 years included.
Equinox EV LT Interior
The more pricey RS version comes with additional features, as you’d expect. It features sporty 21-inch black wheels, ambient lighting, leatherette seating material, heated and powered front seats, wireless phone charging, and auto-dimming mirrors. The Convenience Package II is available, though it starts at a more digestible $3,095. It comes with ventilated front seats, a head-up display, dual-zone climate control, and a digital rearview mirror.
One thing to note is that the higher-end Equinox EV variants are often the ones that dealers add more incentives to.
The Equinox EV is not the perfect electric car, but it comes pretty close, all things considered. It doesn’t have the best charging capabilities and it won’t knock your socks off, but it’s a solid crossover with an even better starting price.
Considering the incentives that both dealers and GM are offering, the Equinox EV is incredibly affordable. It undercuts just about every other crossover on the market, gasoline or electric, all while offering over 300 miles of range.
Chevy Equinox EV LT
We recommend the base version as it is the same vehicle, just with fewer options. Instead of adding on $10,000 to $15,000 in options, it’s better to just buy a more premium vehicle, like a Tesla Model Y or a mid-level Kia EV6. Those offer better performance, driving dynamics, charging speeds and other features.
Even at $34,995 with no incentives, the Equinox EV is an excellent deal. But for prices encroaching upon the $23,000 mark, there is simply no reason for interested buyers not to buy one.

Nissan Leaf: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/745015/nissan-leaf-used-buying-guide/,"If you’re looking to get from A to a reasonably distanced point B on a budget, a used Nissan Leaf could be an intriguing option.",12/19/2024 13:00,"The Nissan Leaf was the first mass-produced electric vehicle. It set the paradigm for the early adopter EV, providing anemic power with minimal range and looking like a bug-eyed space capsule. It perfectly suited the core EV buyer in 2010: someone who felt the Toyota Prius was not quirky or hardcore enough.
Competitors surpassed the Leaf. Tesla proved EVs could be cool and offer more than three times as much range as the Leaf. Chevrolet built the more fully baked Bolt EV. And the market now has a robust segment of entry-level electric crossovers. But Nissan has kept updating the Leaf. And the brand has clung doggedly to its main virtue against the competition: affordability.
The Nissan Leaf S is America’s cheapest EV in production, with a starting MSRP below $30,000. And if you’re looking to get from A to a reasonably distanced point B on a budget, a used Nissan Leaf could be an intriguing option.
If you’re in the market for a used Nissan Leaf, here are the questions you must ask (and potential pitfalls to avoid).
The main distinction between Nissan Leafs is generational. The first-gen Nissan Leaf (2011-17) was a pioneer. But it also put out 107 horsepower and offered a paltry 73 miles of EPA-estimated range with its 24 kWh battery pack. A larger 30 kWh pack added late in the model run bumped the range to 107 miles. Remember, those cars now deliver significantly less in range than they did then.
Nissan broadened the Leaf’s niche with the second generation (2018-present). The base 42 kWH battery now brings an EPA-estimated 149 miles of range. Nissan now offers the Leaf Plus, introduced in 2019, which bumps the power output to 215 hp and the EPA-estimated range to 212 miles with its 62 kWh battery.
Used Nissan Leafs have a broad price range. You get what you pay for. First-generation Leafs tend to be dramatically cheaper. Older first-gen models, often with high mileage and diminished range, can be found for below $5,000. Later first-gen models with the 30 kWh battery may cost between $5,000 and $10,000.
Second-gen Leafs tend to be priced higher, between $10,000 and $20,000, depending on the age, usage and whether it was a Plus model. A used Leaf Plus model of recent vintage might crack $20,000. Almost every used Nissan Leaf should be beneath the $25,000 threshold for the used EV tax credit.
Yes. All lithium-ion batteries lose capacity over time. That can be a particular concern for first-gen Nissan Leafs. These cars have been on the road for a decade or more, had relatively primitive battery tech, and were often used hard by their owners, who charged 100 percent frequently. A Leaf that began with 73 miles of range may top out in the 40s or 50s now.
Some pre-2015 Leafs suffered particularly bad degradation when exposed to extreme heat in climates like the American Southwest. Nissan used passive air cooling for the battery packs rather than liquid cooling, which many modern EVs use. Nissan introduced a more resilient 24 kWh “Lizard” battery in 2015.
Nissan LEAF fast charging (CHAdeMO) at EVgo station
Nissan sold differently configured Leafs. That can make a difference in how quickly the vehicle can charge. For Level 2 home charging, first-gen models came with a base 3.6 kW capacity and an optional upgrade to 6.6 kW. The latter now comes standard on second-generation Leafs. This rate is slower than the 11.4 kW home charging some EVs are capable of. But remember that the Leaf has a smaller battery.
Fast charging for a Leaf is relatively slow by modern EV standards. Leaf vehicles come with a 50 kW quick charge port. Leaf Plus models upgrade to a 100 kW high-output quick charge port. The Leaf uses the CHAdeMO plug for fast charging; it’s basically the only EV still using it. That leaves Leaf owners with comparatively few options for fast charging.
Early first-gen Nissan Leafs struggled with cabin heating demands, sapping the range in cold weather. Nissan added the option for a more efficient heat pump in 2013, listed on the Monroney as the “Hybrid Heater System.” It came on higher trims and as part of a cold weather package. Having that can help diminish winter range loss.
Testing has shown second-generation Leafs to be stouter than the original model in cold weather conditions. A 2019 Leaf outperformed several competitors, maintaining its range in cold weather.
Yes. However, make sure to read the fine print. Nissan typically sold Leafs with a three-year or 36,000-mile comprehensive warranty, a five-year or 60,000-mile powertrain warranty and (on battery packs larger than the 24 kWh pack) an eight-year or 100,000-mile battery warranty. Most first-gen Leafs will be out of warranty. Most second-gen Leafs will still have some warranty on the battery.
Remember that the battery warranty does not entitle the owner to a new battery. Nissan scores its battery capacity out of 12 bars. Dipping below 9/12 bars makes the Leaf eligible for a battery warranty repair. The warranty only covers repairs to bring the battery back up to 9/12 bars.",Ty Duffy
Tesla Model Y Juniper Could Enter Production In Shanghai In January,https://insideevs.com/news/745040/tesla-model-y-juniper-january/,The refreshed version of the world’s best-selling EV is expected to bring important changes and improvements.,12/19/2024 12:00,"Tesla is working on a revised version of the Model Y electric crossover called Project Juniper. Like the Highland update for the Model 3, this Model Y refresh is expected to bring numerous changes and improvements to an already very successful vehicle, but we don’t know exactly when it will enter production.
The local media in China, quoted by CnEVPost, reports that the Model Y Juniper will enter mass production in January, which is less than a month away. The Model Y is built in China at Tesla’s massive production facility in Shanghai, which supplies China and other world markets.
Tesla Model Y Juniper
There have been multiple sightings of camouflaged Model Y prototypes both in China and the U.S. with its front and rear parts hidden. It is expected to feature completely redesigned fascias and light clusters, and it may even have full-width light bars in the front and rear. It will also have revised wheel designs and new paint colors.
Inside, we expect a similar makeover to the Model 3 Highland, which lost its indicator and transmission stalks (which are available as an aftermarket add-on), but it upped the materials and assembly quality compared to the pre-refresh model. The revised Model 3 also has a much softer and more compliant suspension, which features frequency selective dampers, and we expect a similar solution will be used on the Model Y Juniper, too.
Elon Musk said that the Model Y update wasn’t a priority, which is why it was coming so much later than the Model 3 facelift, allowing the company to focus on other projects like the Cybercab. However, there are many rival models gunning for the Model Y’s success, even ones that perhaps follow its formula a bit too closely, like the Onvo L60, while others tread their own path, hoping to woo buyers with a very different proposition.
We also heard reports about a possible six-seater version of the Model Y, which would be available in China and Europe but not the United States.
The fact that the revised Model Y may enter production in China in early 2025 isn’t necessarily relevant for the U.S. market since the locally sold Model Y is made in the States. However, there have been multiple camouflaged Model Y prototype sightings in the U.S., the most recent being in San Jose, California, which may indicate that Stateside production is also imminent.

Honda-Nissan Merger May Prevent A Hostile Takeover,https://insideevs.com/news/744929/2024-12-19-cm/,"Plus, Canoo is once again in trouble as it furloughs more workers and Subaru is betting big on a new hybrid plant.",12/19/2024 10:15,"The world was a bit shocked when news of a potential merger between Honda and Nissan was dropped. But the bigger question that crossed many minds was, ""Why?"" We know Nissan has been in some financial trouble lately, but for Honda to consider throwing it such a lifeline is perplexing. However, new reports indicate that Honda could be a bulwark between Nissan and a potential hostile takeover.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Honda and Nissan's merger talks potentially entering the negotiation phase as early as next week, plus Canoo furloughs even more workers, and Subaru's secret weapon: hybrids. Let's jump in.
The rumors have been circulating all week: industry big-wig Honda and troubled Nissan could be in talks for one of the most unexpected mergers in recent years. While critics remained skeptical of initial reports, Bloomberg confirmed that higher-ups at both companies have been in talks over a deal, and perhaps an even bigger shocker, it could spill over to become a triumvirate that includes Mitsubishi as well.
These types of deals typically move at the speed of molasses. So it should come as a surprise that a new report from Nikkei Asia, the publication that originally reported initial talks of a merger, says that formal negotiations could begin as early as next week on Dec. 23.
Make no mistake—this marriage isn't really one of convenience. Honda has been working to pivot its focus to electrification for some time. Following a dissolved partnership with General Motors, Honda joined forces with Nissan (and then Mitsubishi) to form a technical partnership to accelerate the development of EV-related tech.
So what's the rush in speeding up negotiations? For starters, Nissan has a time clock running. Some have pegged the company's chance for survival requiring a complete financial turnaround in 12 to 14 months.
Other reports suggest that the trifecta alliance was at risk of falling apart after Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn approached Nissan to acquire a stake in the company. Reuters says that Jun Seki, former deputy COO of Nissan who now leads Foxconn's EV unit, is headed to France to speak with Renault to purchase at least some of the automaker's stake in Nissan. Renault currently holds a 15% stake in Nissan.
According to reports, Foxconn ""directly expressed"" its willingness to purchase Nissan equity directly. Honda reportedly threatened to dissolve the partnership if Foxconn were to purchase Nissan, and ultimately Nissan declined to sell to Foxconn. The Taiwanese company then approached Renault.
Here's where things get interesting. Bloomberg says that Honda could be positioning itself as ""a white knight in the event of a hostile takeover attempt,"" which may be exactly what's starting as Foxconn has reportedly approached Renault about purchasing the shares given that Nissan has already declined to sell.
Either way, company officials have yet to comment about talks of the merger publicly other than a joint statement addressing that the brands were “considering various possibilities for future collaboration.""
It's starting to sound like a broken record at this point, but EV startup Canoo is in trouble. Yes, again. Or maybe still. Either way, the startup has once again furloughed employees and is officially pressing pause on its Oklahoma manufacturing plant in order to scrape together funds to stay afloat.
Its decision to furlough 82 of its remaining employees comes just over a month after it decided to furlough about 30 people in November, bringing an estimated 90-day halt to more than 130 workers. The brand went from 800 employees at its peak in 2021 to a currently unspecified number. Its most recent round of furloughs represents both salaried and hourly employees and is a grasp to remain alive as it remains in “advanced discussions with various capital sources,"" according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
TechCrunch points out a few recent events that led up to today's furloughs:
The announcement comes just a few days after board member James Chen resigned, and roughly one month after the company saw its chief financial officer and head lawyer depart. Canoo is also facing multiple lawsuits from suppliers over alleged late payments.

The new furloughs cap what has been a rough year for the startup. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs and furloughs, and closed the Los Angeles office that used to serve as its headquarters. Canoo’s chief technology officer left in August, and all of the company’s founders are now gone. In the meantime, it has been kept afloat by loans from the venture firm run by its CEO, Tony Aquila.
“We regret having to furlough our employees, especially during the holidays, but we have no choice at this point,"" wrote Canoo in a statement published by TechCrunch. ""We are hopeful that we will be able to bring them back to work soon.”
As for the idled plant, it's not quite clear exactly what Canoo is manufacturing in Oklahoma right now. The most obvious answer is debt, as the brand isn't exactly pumping out vehicles left and right. Sure, it had some trial contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, the U.S. Postal Service, and the State of Oklahoma, but Canoo's future was far from its original plans of being a consumer-facing EV manufacturer with some pretty darn cool cars.
The future for Canoo looks bleak. Lawsuits over unpaid bills, furloughed employees, and little commercial interest in its vehicles being communicated to the public make it seem like the brand could go belly-up in the coming months without a sack of investor cash being dropped on its doorstep.
Subaru is well known for its rugged all-wheel-drive cars—whether it be sporty sedans like the WRX or capable family SUVs like the Ascent, the automaker has a reputation for being the go-to brand in many parts of the world are plagued with less-then-stellar weather. However, one thing that Subaru isn't exactly known for is electrification.
The brand has admittedly had a late start to the EV game. Its only EV on sale today, the Solterra, was brought to market with the help of Toyota. As will its next four EV models if its joint-development partnership continues as planned. Subaru has found itself in a bit of a conundrum—it doesn't yet have the battery tech to compete with the rest of the industry on its own, and with strict emission regulations cracking down across the globe, its hybrid game could use some work, too. Thankfully, the automaker has a Hail Mary up its sleeve for the latter, according to Automotive News.
See, Subaru wants to electrify all its models in the first half of the 2030s. This means either going full battery-electric (as it's doing with the help of Toyota on some models) or varying degrees of hybridization, both standard and plug-in.
Enter the Kitamoto factory. This plant has been around since 1995 and has served Subaru well for non-passenger car needs (think industrial equipment, snowmobiles, and the like). The automaker phased out this area of its business in 2019 and has since chosen the facility to be the home of its new hybrid transaxle—the last-ditch effort to keep its venerable Boxer engine alive in a world where there are plenty of more efficient choices to choose from.
Kitamoto is Subaru's answer to a stop-gap between combustion and full electrification. The brand plans to apply the lessons learned at Kitamoto to its next-gen Oizumi plant that will build future EV and hybrids after 2027.
This particular plant has started the production of Subaru's new electrified transaxle that will power a new generation of strong hybrids beginning with the next-gen Crosstrek and Forester crossovers. In Japan, this will begin as early as Spring 2025. The U.S. will receive the transaxle the following year—built in Kitamoto and shipped to its plant in Lafayette, Indiana where the next-gen Forester will be built.
The U.S. market accounts for 71% of Subaru's global sales. And hybrids? Well, Americans are lapping them up as of late. In fact, hybrids made up 10.8% of the entire light-duty vehicle market last quarter, significantly ahead of the 7% share for BEVs in Q3. To remain relevant, Subaru needs to compete in the hybrids segment, and its underpowered mild hybrids have historically not been the right answer.
So while Subaru might not be at the forefront of pure electrification, it is pouring its heart into pumping up its hybrid offerings to keep competing in global and U.S. markets. Kitamoto will prove to be Subaru's proving ground—that it can scale and compete with even the biggest player. More importantly, it means keeping a legend, its horizontally opposed Boxer motor, alive.
Subaru's push forward with hybrids over pure electrification is an interesting one. The brand is a small player compared to other Japanese giants, which means that dumping billions of dollars into a homegrown electrification program isn't as easy as, say, Ford, GM, or any other the big European brands out there. Joining forces for development (like it's done with Toyota already) is a logical step forward.
Other big automakers are also pulling back from their once-big electrification plans and others have always insisted that a ""multipathway"" approach was the right way to go.
Do you think that Subaru's approach will work in the long run? Where might it run into some hurdles along the way? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

Tesla's Head Designer Hints Robotaxi Could Get Additional Form Factors,https://insideevs.com/news/744880/tesla-robotaxi-additional-form-factors/,Could this be the Robovan concept or something else?,12/19/2024 10:00,"Tesla's Robotaxi ambitions are sending its share soaring right now. Investors are riled up over Tesla's promises to deliver a commercial autonomy platform, and that all starts with its first dedicated vehicle: the Cybercab.
During a recent overview of the Cybercab at the Petersen Automotive Museum, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen made a cryptic remark: “We have other vehicles in our lineup and future vehicles coming that will basically take multiple passengers.” Could this be referring to the teased Robovan concept, or does Tesla have something else up its sleeve for its future fleet of autonomous cars?
Let's remember that Travis Axelrod, Tesla's Head of Investor Relations, told Deutsche Bank that 2025 would be ""a year of product launches.""  We know this refers to Tesla's unofficially-named ""Model Q"" and a long wheelbase Model Y with three rows for the Chinese market, but Axelrod also noted that the second half of 2025 would feature the release of ""other new vehicles""—yes, that's vehicles with an ""s.""
Between Axelrod and von Holzhausen's comments, it raises the question of whether or not Tesla has some additional Robotaxis on the horizon that the world has yet to see.
Tesla has said that designing the Cybercab with two seats was deliberate. Data suggests that most ride-hailing trips involve just one or two passengers, meaning that Tesla could cut down on costs and maximize storage by limiting the Cybercab to just two seats. However, that leaves a huge gap in the market for larger groups of people looking to hail a ride from an autonomous car.
Tesla has long planned to fill that gap using its fleet of existing cars on the road as robotaxis. Even before the robotaxi was a twinkle in Elon Musk's eye, the CEO had talked about launching the Tesla Network, an autonomous ride-sharing app that utilizes customer-owned Teslas equipped with Full Self-Driving to provide Uber-like services when not in use. That was all the way back in 2020 and a lot has changed since then—like the idea of bringing a dedicated robotaxi platform with no steering wheels or pedals into the mix.
One of the biggest hurdles for this approach comes from within. Tesla will first have to figure out if its cars equipped with aging Hardware 3 and current Hardware 4 FSD computers will be able to actually operate fully autonomously. The Cybercab will ship with Hardware 5 (or, as Musk has called it, AI5). It's unclear if older cars will be able to operate at a hardware level necessary for Level 5 fully automated driving, which means either Tesla pushes existing models with new FSD hardware, or consider new dedicated vehicles. Could this be what Franz has suggested during his talk at Petersen?
It's questionable if the next dedicated platform will be the Robovan, as that would require certain costly accessibility concessions to the Tesla network very early on rather than be developed as it grows. The Robovan, which is slated for carrying over 20 people, must meet the Americans With Disabilities Act's ""readily accessible and usable"" standard for demand-responsive transportation systems—meaning that the Robovan must be designed from the ground up to be immediately usable by people with disabilities (think built-in ramps, doors, and multimodal controls). The two-seater Cybercab (and the rest of Tesla's fleet) would only need to provide ""equivalent service,"" which would be an alternative method for folks with disabilities to utilize the service.
This is obviously a more complicated approach to launching a service, which is why Tesla could be focused on launching smaller capacity vehicles—like the Cybercab and enabling the function on existing models—prior to the Robovan. Even General Motors recently threw in the towel with Cruise's robotaxi service, given concerns over the capital requirements to launch and maintain it.
Von Holzhausen's comments hint at Tesla's bigger picture. Its CEO has said time and time again that Tesla's is an AI company that just happens to build cars, so maximizing its offerings to meet that narrative would be Tesla's main priority. Tesla has yet to confirm what other robotaxi designs—if any—are in development, but it's clear that the company sees the need for additional models across its fleet to meet some needs; otherwise, why would Axelrod drop the hint that Tesla would announce several vehicles in the new year?
For now, the Cybercab and Robovan are the only two dedicated robotaxi platforms that Tesla has officially previewed to the world. Whether it complements those vehicles with existing models or completely new vehicles is still to be seen, but it at least creates a bit of justification for Tesla's hyped-up stock price.

BMW Built An All-Electric M2 Prototype,https://www.motor1.com/news/744902/bmw-m2-ev-prototype/,A small team of engineers has been working on this car since 2018.,12/25/2024 1:24,"BMW's M division is going electric. Last week the company teased an all-electric version of its iconic M3, set to hit showrooms in 2027. Now, the company is showing off another all-electric M car: A prototype based on the first-generation M2 coupe.
The car, internally called The Beast, was conceived by a small group of engineers in 2018 on a ""mission to explore what's possible,"" according to Michael Sailer, one of the team's dynamics engineers.
The car looks fairly stock on the outside, save for a couple of tow hooks, a ducktail trunk spoiler, and a set of gold-painted brake calipers—likely carbon-ceramics. The cabin has been stripped to accommodate a roll cage, a racing seat, and a suite of testing equipment.
BMW did not go into detail on the M2 prototype's powertrain, but it's clear the factory turbocharged straight-six has been replaced by some kind of electric power. Seeing as how every electric M car will have four motors, this M2 may be rocking a quad-motor setup itself. But that's just speculation.
Engineers describe the battery-powered M2 prototype as hard to control. M boss Frank Van Meel compares it to the F10-generation M5, which sent power to the rear wheels only, making it a relative handful considering its twin-turbo V-8 power. It forced the team to turn to AWD for the next-generation car.
""I can still remember January 2015, Cobo Hall, Detroit Motor Show, where I said in an interview, the next M5 generation will need four-wheel drive,"" he said. ""And everyone was going 'this is the end of the universe,' because if you put four-wheel drive on an M car it will only go straight forward, there will be no dynamics left.""
Van Meel said he had to ""live with this shit-storm"" for three years until the first all-wheel drive M5 came out, then everyone drove it and loved it. He likens the transition to electric power to the transition from rear-wheel drive to all-wheel drive.
""Trust me, that what we're working on now for the future will be at least as great as what we did [with the first AWD M5],"" he said. ""Now we will make that beast controllable, so that the next step in high performance is on the horizon.""

"Rivian R1S And R1T EVs Finally Get Native YouTube, Google Cast And SiriusXM",https://insideevs.com/news/744996/rivian-r1s-r1t-youtube-google-cast-sirius-xm/,"Netflix is still unavailable, but owners can use other apps like Disney+ and Max to cast videos to their vehicle's screen.",12/19/2024 6:12,"Rivian makes some very compelling adventure-oriented electric cars, but if you were stuck charging on a slow DC stall, you had very limited multimedia options on the built-in center touchscreen.
Some owners found clever workarounds such as using a USB memory stick to watch pre-downloaded videos, but that’s no longer needed, as the California-based startup is finally rolling out features that have been promised for over a year.
A native YouTube app, a native SiriusXM app, as well as Google Cast functionality, are rolling out right now as part of the software version 2024.47, which is available for both the first- and second-gen R1S and R1T.
More Rivian Stories
The update was announced back in May when Rivian said it would come “soon.” Well, it’s finally here, which means owners can watch YouTube videos on the car’s center screen without having to use their smartphone. The same goes for the SiriusXM app, which uses WiFi or cellular data to stream audio to the vehicle’s speakers.
When it comes to Google Cast, you can think of it as having a built-in Chromecast in the car. If you’re unfamiliar with the tech, it basically means you can use a smartphone as a remote to cast content, including video, to the car’s screen. The content is pulled from the internet by the car, but you need a smartphone to control things like subtitles or choose episodes from a TV series.
Videos can only be played while the car is in Park. Furthermore, while video streaming apps that offer Google Cast functionality include Netflix, Amazon, Prime, Disney+ and Max, Rivian R1S and R1T owners cannot currently cast content from the Netflix app.
Things get a little more complicated when looking at how Rivian is bundling these new features. The YouTube app and Google Cast functionality are part of the company’s Connect+ technology package which costs $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. Connect+ also includes an in-vehicle hotspot, satellite images for the navigation system, Amazon Alexa commands, Apple Music, Audible, Spotify, Tidal, TuneIn, Gear Guard Live Cam and priority software updates.
SiriusXM satellite radio, on the other hand, is separate from the Connect+ bundle and needs a subscription bought directly from SiriusXM, which costs between $9.99 and $24.98 per month.
Rivian said all customers will have “a temporary preview of the Google Cast and YouTube features that can be streamed through Connect+,” and that a free trial subscription to SiriusXM will be offered.
Besides these new features, the latest software version includes improvements for the Highway Assist system on Gen 2 vehicles, new graphics for some sections of the infotainment system and a bunch of smaller fixes.",Iulian Dnistran
European EV Sales Were A Mixed Bag In November,https://insideevs.com/news/744949/ev-sales-europe-november-2024/,"Hybrids increased their market share once again, while gas- and diesel-powered cars continued their decline.",12/19/2024 2:40,"As the year is coming to an end, the European electric vehicle market couldn’t be murkier. It’s a mishmash of numbers and depending on where you look or who you ask, you might get two completely different answers to the question, “How are EVs doing in Europe?”
In November, some countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland and Czechia had double- and even triple-digit increases in EV registrations, while others, such as Croatia, France, Germany and Romania had double-digit decreases in EV registrations last month compared to the same period last year.
These are all members of the European Union, but there’s also the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, that can go into the mix. The United Kingdom is also a big market that needs to be considered.
More Stuff Like This
So, how does the electric vehicle market look in Europe? In November, EV registrations in the European Union went down 9.5% compared to the same month last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). However, when adding the numbers for the EFTA and the UK, registrations actually went up 0.9%.
In the first 11 months of the year–an arguably more important metric than the monthly numbers–EV registrations in the EU went down 5.4% compared to last year. In the EU, EFTA and UK, registrations went down 1.4%. To date, a total of 1,787,600 EVs were registered in Europe, down from last year’s 1,812,987. Some countries like Germany, France and Romania reduced or removed financial incentives for buying all-electric vehicles this year, and it shows in their registration numbers.
The only power source that saw consistent gains throughout the year is hybrid electric. Last month, hybrid vehicle registrations increased by 16.4% compared to last year. Year-to-date, 3,704,732 hybrids were registered in the EU, EFTA and UK, an 18.7% increase year-on-year.
Monthly car registrations in Europe, November 2024
January-November 2024 vehicle registration numbers in Europe
Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) went down 8.6% in November, with 83,400 registrations. Year-to-date, PHEVs recorded a decrease of 4.6% with a total of 860,739 units registered. Gas- and diesel-powered cars were also down. Gasoline vehicle registrations declined 12.4% in November and 6.6% after 11 months. Meanwhile, diesel registrations went down 15.4% last month 11.6% year-to-date.
Overall, the European car market, including the EU, EFTA and UK, went down 2% in November. Year-to-date, the market went up a very modest 0.6%, an increase attributed almost entirely to the uptick in hybrid vehicle registrations.
All this being said, probably the most important takeaway is that the market share for both gasoline and diesel cars is shrinking. Eleven months into 2024, gas vehicles have a 33.4% market share, down from 36% last year, while diesel cars have 10.6%, down from 12% last year. All-electric vehicles have a 15.1% market share, down from 15.4% last year. Plug-in hybrids went down from 7.6% last year to 7.2%, while hybrids soared from 26.5% market share in the first 11 months of last year to 31.2% this year.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s A First Look At Honda’s New Electric SUV,https://insideevs.com/news/744801/honda-0-series-suv-teaser/,The boxy electric crossover will go into production in 2026 alongside a wedge-shaped sedan.,12/18/2024 19:00,"Honda has big plans for its electric vehicle future. After collaborating with General Motors to produce the Prologue crossover–which is doing rather well, sales-wise–the Japanese automaker will do everything on its own for the next chapter.
You might have read something about the Honda 0 Series lineup, which was first previewed last year by the Saloon and Space-Hub EV concept. The Saloon was a wedge-shaped EV with strong DeLorean DMC-12 vibes and at the time, Honda was adamant that it would form the base for a series production model.
Well, now Honda has released a new teaser showing two EVs. Both are prototypes, but the automaker said they “represent the next models in the Honda 0 Series.” That’s exciting stuff because the Saloon had a pretty radical design, and it’s cool to see car manufacturers sticking to their promises and bringing some well-needed attitude to today’s roads.
More Honda Stuff
While we already know what the sedan looks like, the crossover on the right has never made an appearance until now. At first glance, it’s quite boxy, which should translate into a spacious interior. There’s a U-shaped LED light strip at the rear, as well as a pair of LED stoplights. The rear bumper also seems to protrude quite a lot.
Both prototypes will be revealed at next year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 7. Moreover, Honda will show its new proprietary vehicle operating system, as well as the automated driving tech it’s working on. The Japanese carmaker is also planning to introduce a new energy service that’s scheduled to go online when the new Honda 0 Series models go into production.
The production version of the Saloon concept is expected to go into production in 2026 at Honda’s new EV hub. It will be cheaper than the Tesla Model S or Model X, but still solidly in the premium segment, as our own Kevin Williams found out during a press trip to Honda’s R&D center in Japan. Besides the sedan, Honda is planning to launch two more electric crossovers, a three-row SUV and two more cheaper SUVs later on. A compact sedan will be the final piece of the puzzle.",Iulian Dnistran
Study Shows That Buyers Really Want Three-Row EV Crossovers,https://insideevs.com/news/744906/ev-three-row-crossover-study/,AutoPacific found that about half of all three-row crossover and SUV buyers would consider buying an EV.,12/18/2024 15:00,"It’s unfortunate that it feels like the EV revolution is stuttering. Yet, this lull feels more manufacturer-related. Everything’s a compact semi-luxury crossover rather than what the people really want: cheap EVs, and, according to AutoPacific’s latest study, three-row crossovers. The analyst group just released its 2024 Future Vehicle Planner, showing that a surprising number of three-row crossover shoppers would consider an electric version.
The survey asked more than 14,000 vehicle shoppers and found that “nearly half” of all three-row SUV and crossover buyers would consider going full EV. About 8% of those buyers said they intend on buying a full EV three-row crossover, something the study says is actually impressive considering the lack of three-row options on sale. Currently, there are only seven models on the market: The Volvo EX90, VinFast VF9, Tesla Model X, Rivian R1S, Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Mercedes-Benz EQB SUV and Kia EV9. Leave out those that are expensive, unproven or have tiny third rows and you're left with... just the Kia. There are more coming; the Cadillac Escalade IQ, Lucid Gravity and Hyundai Ioniq 9 are on their way next year.
This strong desire for EV three rows shows that there’s real room for growth in the segment, especially for cheaper models. AutoPacific found that 59% of three-row crossover and SUV buyers intend to spend less than $50,000. The only three-row EVs that get close to that price are the Mercedes-Benz EQB and Kia EV9. The EQB’s tiny third row might not be what families are looking for, but if judged by the fairly healthy sales of the Kia EV9, AutoPacific might just be onto something here.
The firm predicts that if trends continue, the three-row EV segment will grow from 100,000 units sold in 2024 to almost 400,000 units by 2029. “All-electric three-row SUVs and crossovers are set to become one of the most important growth segments in the EV space,” says Ed Kim, AutoPacific’s president and chief analyst.  Perhaps it wasn't so wise for Ford to kill off its three-row EV crossover.
The study also says that the ideal buyer of a three-row EV SUV is a single female who lives in a single-family house and drives less than 30 miles a day. This person is aware of the need for home EV charging but doesn’t think it’s too hard to get installed (or they have it done already). They like the convenience of a three-row vehicle, love the tech gadgets inherent to a modern EV and like the idea of an environmentally-friendly car. But, they don’t want to make any concessions to get any of that stuff. It’s not an easy target for any manufacturer to hit, that’s for sure.

EPA Approves California's Gas Car Ban,https://insideevs.com/news/744899/california-gas-car-ban-approved/,"Eleven other states follow California's emissions rules, which means a large part of the U.S. could be EV or PHEV only next decade.",12/25/2024 1:25,"The Biden Administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has green-lighted California's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, effectively approving the state's proposes gas car ban. With 11 other states already committed to adopting the regulations and the first set of requirements taking effect in 2026, this will have a seismic impact on the U.S. auto market.
If it survives.
California has long been given the authority to impose different, tighter emissions standards on top of federal regulations. This dates to the Clean Air Act days, as California's geography makes it particularly susceptible to smog. Low-lying coastal areas fenced in by mountains can cause heavy pollutants to settle, which blanketed much of LA with thick smog that was dangerous to breathe consistently. But the EPA has to approve many of its environmental regulations, and incoming President Trump is likely to roll back federal support for this initiative.
During his first term, he withdrew California's ability to set its own new vehicle rules. Biden reinstated it. Trump has promised to roll back any EV mandates this time around, and that's what this policy effectively is. Advanced Clean Cars II will require 100% of light-duty passenger vehicle sales to be Zero-Emissions Vehicles—EVs or Hydrogen vehicles—or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). To ramp up to that, it requires 35% of all new vehicle sales to be ZEVs or PHEVs in 2026, with the quota getting stricter from there.
Eleven other states are committed to following this plan, albeit some of them with different timelines. Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington are all on board. Washington D.C. is also committed. This is important, as the broad number of states and their relatively scattered geography make it difficult for automakers to handle compliance. They can't ignore these states—California alone is the nation's biggest auto market—but they also can't just ship all of their EVs west and continue as normal in the rest of the country.
California is a car-heavy state, with regulations that affect the whole auto market.
The hard part is that the market is not yet moving fast enough to satisfy California's requirements, and there's not much time before the 2026 targets hit. About 25% of vehicles sold in California this year will be EVs, with PHEVs taking up around 4% of sales. If you include standard hybrids California is already above the 35% threshold, but the regulations don't count those. While California may be able to hit that 35% target in 2026, it remains to be seen whether the other states will get there.
Or if it'll matter at all. The approval is unlikely to survive a Trump Administration EPA. While California can and likely will fight for its right to set strict emissions standards, that's a court battle that could easily end up at the Supreme Court. A quick decision is unlikely.

That's a big, big problem. You can have your own opinion on the EV mandates. I certainly do. I'm not sure that the timeline is realistic for the states outside of California, and the auto industry is starting to crack under the financial pressure of having to sell so many EVs at a loss. But climate change demands action, and some companies are clearly slow-rolling things. Wherever you fall though, there's one obvious truth: Multi-billion-dollar industries with global supply chains, crazy high investment costs, skilled labor pools and countless challenges in dozens of markets cannot afford this level of uncertainty.
Mandate EVs or don't. But if we spend another four years jockeying back and forth with wild swings in the regulatory climate, the U.S. auto market will face a collapse like it's never seen. The industry needs clarity, and so do consumers.

"Tesla Model Y Juniper Spotted Driving In San Jose, California",https://insideevs.com/news/744569/tesla-model-y-juniper-update-spotted-video/,"This sighting is one of many, and the car is still lightly camouflaged.",12/18/2024 13:00,"We all know by now that Teslas get better over time due to almost constant software updates. However, there comes a time when an overhaul is due and for the Model Y, that time has to be soon. With the Tesla Model 3 getting its significant ""Highland"" upgrade, the question now is, when will the Model Y ""Juniper"" upgrade enter production?
More Model Y Juniper Info
The Highland version of the Model 3 came equipped with a revised exterior, a revised front fascia featuring new headlight clusters, slimmer taillights, redesigned mirrors, new wheel designs and new exterior colors, as well as a much-improved suspension. We expect the Juniper version of the Model Y to pretty closely match the updates found on the new Model 3, which also means that the interior should get the new steering wheel from the Model 3, which has more buttons than before because it no longer has stalks on the steering column.
With the Juniper Model Y launch looming, public sightings have become more common. This latest sighting comes to us via Colin W. on X, who spotted the Juniper near San Jose, California. It's a brief clip, but it gives a pretty clear view of the Model Y's driver's side, which only has some camo on the front and rear.
The biggest change we saw with the Highland Model 3 was its improved ride. It got a completely revised suspension system, transforming it into a much more comfortable car. We expect this to carry over to the revised Model Y but is that a big enough improvement for you to consider waiting for the updated version of the Model Y? Since we don't know when it will arrive, we're on the fence here, especially since there's a chance that the Model Y will lose its $7,500 tax credit soon.
Here's what we suggest. If you don’t need the Model Y’s roomier trunk and easier access, the cheaper revised Model 3 is probably a better option. If you need the extra room, either buy a Model Y now and get the tax credit or wait for the revised version, which may not get the credit. It's a bit of a gamble, though.

"Ram Delays Full EV Pickup, Bets On Ramcharger EREV First",https://insideevs.com/news/744905/ram-1500-ramcharger-rev-delay/,Ram will open orders for the Ramcharger pickup in the first half of 2025.,12/18/2024 12:41,"Ram parent company Stellantis on Wednesday said it will delay the brand's first fully electric pickup truck, the 1500 REV, to 2026 from its previously announced launch date of early 2025.
But there's good news for fans of the brand's upcoming extended-range EV pickup, the Ramcharger. That innovative model, essentially an EV with a gas generator that boosts range, isn't going anywhere. Stellantis says orders will open up for customers in the first half of 2025.
Ram 1500 REV
Slowing growth in the EV market has pushed scores of automakers to pull back their EV investments and delay new products. Stellantis said the decision was partially motivated by ""slowing industry demand for half-ton BEV pickups.""
And in that way, the move makes sense. Ford—and, let's be honest, everybody else—thought the electric F-150 Lightning would be a way bigger hit than it has been. General Motors has launched three EV pickups in the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and GMC Hummer EV. So Ram's truck will have a lot of rivals in a market that just isn't developing as the industry expected it to.
Part of the problem there is that electric trucks need huge batteries to deliver any kind of range, and that makes them way more expensive than their gas counterparts. Plus, towing anything deals a huge blow to range. The Ramcharger seeks to solve some of those issues. It has a 92-kilowatt-hour battery, plus an engine that feeds it extra juice and doesn't power the wheels. The idea is that on longer trips or under heavy loads, the Ramcharger can do more than a standard EV can.
And other companies are following Ram's lead here. Stellantis is planning extended-range Jeeps, while Hyundai has some EREVs up its sleeve too.

"Tavares: China Is 'Many Years' Ahead With EVs, Says EU Politicians Created 'Dead End'",https://www.motor1.com/news/744740/tavares-resignation-amicable-blames-eu-politicians/,"The Ex-Stellantis CEO believes China is years ahead when it comes to EVs, hence his push for company goals many said were unrealistic.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares isn't backing down from the decisions that led to his resignation. In his first interview since voluntarily exiting the company, he effectively double-downed on his stance that conflicted with the Stellantis board members. At the same time, he voiced concerns that China was far ahead in the electric fold, essentially forcing European brands into survival mode.
Speaking with Portuguese news outlet Expresso, the ex-executive emphasized the importance of having a strong, singular vision and admitted his plan didn't mesh with the board.
""A company that has 250,000 employees and 15 brands cannot be managed with a lack of alignment,” said Tavares, according to Expresso. That was the catalyst for his resignation, which Tavares described as an ""amicable"" joint decision between him and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. And it seems he has no regrets, as Wards Auto reports he would make the same calls if it all came about again.
His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

"The Nissan-Honda Crisis, Explained",https://insideevs.com/news/744875/honda-nissan-charging-cm/,We knew Honda and Nissan were entering into a technical partnership. Now a merger may be in the cards to save a struggling Nissan.,12/18/2024 10:45,"The news sent shockwaves across the auto industry, Wall Street and even the consumer space: Struggling Japanese automaker Nissan may merge with considerably less struggling Japanese automaker Honda. If you own, have owned or are a fan of either brand, this may come as a total surprise to you, and that's understandable. But I'm about to fill you in on why this might be happening and what it means for the entire car business as a whole.
That's the lead item on this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Make sure you subscribe to our newsletter in the link below and check out the Plugged-In Podcast from InsideEVs, with new episodes dropping on audio platforms and YouTube on Fridays.
Also on tap today: some good news on the EV charging front, even with President Donald Trump coming in with a vendetta against electric funding. Let's dig in.
Honda Nissan Mitsubishi Partnership
I've actually been inundated with text messages about this news from my normal friends and family members—you know, people who don't fastidiously read automotive trade publications, Bloomberg and the Financial Times multiple times a day. ""Wait, Nissan and Honda?"" they ask. ""What's wrong with Nissan? Or Honda?""
That's because most people don't understand the rough shape that Nissan, specifically, is in these days. It's just kind of one of those normal, everyday car brands that people buy when they don't want to think that much about buying a car, or its specs, or how it looks—they need something new and they need a good deal. But that's the problem. That's what that brand has become in the U.S., its biggest and most important global market.
What people don't realize is that Nissan's sales and profits here and worldwide have been tanking for years now. Dealer profits in the U.S. are down 70% year-over-year. Operating profit plunged by 99% in its first financial quarter. Sales have been sliding even worse in China, where homegrown car brands have been displacing the Western and other Asian ones at a rapid pace for years now.
The cars may offer decent deals, but they aren't competitive in terms of technology. Nissan sells no hybrid cars in the U.S. at a time when they're having a huge moment. (The opposite is true for Toyota, for example, which is having a great year thanks to hybrids.) And despite being an early mover in the EV space, Nissan only sells the outdated Leaf and the so-so Ariya, while it's delayed a slew of other models; it doesn't have the momentum that, say, General Motors or Hyundai have in the electric realm.
You can blame this on a lot of things, but one of the biggest culprits is the fallout from two crises: the fall of its former megaboss Carlos Ghosn and the talent drain that happened afterward, followed by the yearslong renegotiation of Nissan's often-awkward alliance with Renault. All that chaos didn't leave Nissan very prepared for the future, and its outdated technology and lineup of cars is catching up to it now.
“The announced merger talks between Nissan and Honda are not surprising, given the recent turbulence impacting legacy automakers globally,"" said Michael Brisson, auto economist at Moody’s Analytics, in an email to InsideEVs. ""Nissan's financial struggles are in no small part a consequence of the surging competition from Chinese automakers. Their 2023 retail sales in China were roughly half of their 2019 figures, a year when China accounted for one in three of Nissan's global sales.""
""These Nissan-Honda merger discussions, coupled with the recent challenges at Stellantis and production cutbacks in Europe, all point to a single, stark reality: a new force has emerged in the automotive sector, and legacy automakers need to be acutely aware of the competitive threat,"" Brisson said.
So, yes. Things are worse at Nissan than your average person probably knows. Now, where does Honda enter into this?
Like the rest of Japan Inc., Honda is behind on fully electric cars (which is a longer story, but here's a good summary of why.) But Honda's cars still sell well. It makes hybrids people like. It's profitable. And Honda really seems to have gotten a wake-up call from the rise of China's automakers, so while it's late to the game, it's orchestrating a big EV push that we'll see the fruits of in the coming years.
To get ahead of the EV powerhouse that is China, these automakers need money, expertise and scale. These are huge investments. They require tons of capital to develop batteries and software, and own the supply chains to develop both. This isn't a game of who makes the best internal-combustion engines anymore. It's a totally different game. And Japan Inc. can either catch up or die, probably at the hands of China's BYD and others.
In response, we've seen Japan's auto industry coalesce around two factions: one led by Toyota that includes Mazda, Subaru and Daihatsu, and another with Honda and Nissan and probably Mitsubishi. Honda and Nissan announced a technical partnership earlier this year to co-develop EVs and software. Now, it could turn into a full-blown merger instead.
Nikkei Asia first reported the news yesterday and it's been featured in countless other outlets, so I do think it has legs. The theory is the two would operate under a holding company that could also eventually include Mitsubishi.
I also think Honda was sparked into action—perhaps even by the Japanese government—over reports that a Chinese automaker or other firm could acquire some or all of Nissan. In theory, that could give one of those companies a way into the U.S. or a better path to Europe through Nissan's dealer networks. Obviously, Japan doesn't want that.
Now the question is, will it actually happen? Here's CNBC with some analysis I like:
The merger report comes at a time when many auto giants are struggling to cope with increased global competition from bigger electric vehicle (EV), makers such as Tesla and China’s BYD.
A mega-merger, however, is expected to face several obstacles. Analysts have expressed concerns about the likelihood of political scrutiny in Japan, given the potential for job cuts if a deal pushes through, while the unwinding of Nissan’s alliance with French vehicle manufacturer Renault is regarded as pivotal to the process.
“This tie-up is not entirely unexpected because obviously they announced their partnership earlier this year,” Lucinda Guthrie, executive editor at Mergermarket, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe” on Wednesday.
“Some of the reports I’ve seen claim that this came about as a result of Foxconn making an approach to Nissan. Now, with this particular transaction, I question whether it is going to be a hardcore merger or whether it is going to be more of a partnership,” she added.
Make no mistake: Honda is the savior here. Or would be, if this goes through. One analyst told CNBC that the deal ""would likely have a negative impact for Honda, but a positive one for Nissan and Mitsubishi.""
But whatever's going to happen will likely take years. The renegotiation of Nissan's situationship with Renault certainly did, and remember that automaker is part-owned by the French government. And here's the thing: if it does work, these companies have more capital to play with, but also a bigger organization, very different internal cultures and challenges around which brand should be doing what.
If this is a survival play for either company—but especially Nissan—success is far from guaranteed.
Electrify America EV Chargers
But it's not all doom and gloom in the EV space. Everyone who watches it closely has been fearful of Trump's threats to axe the EV tax credits, which would almost certainly dampen sales and derail the electric transition the Biden administration was pushing so hard for. Yet one thing that could hurt EV growth even more is if funding for public fast chargers were to dry up as well.
Automotive News reports today that thankfully, that isn't very likely. Why? Because much of that money has already been doled out to states, which then distribute it to various companies that then build the chargers:
“It would take almost an act of God for Trump or Congress to overturn” the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, said Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, which recently acquired McDonald’s EV Adoption firm.
That’s because much of the $5 billion that underpins the initiative has already been doled out to the states. The remainder was preapproved. Policymakers designed the five-year program, which started in 2021, to help states create a network of public charging stations in 50-mile intervals along interstates.
Eleven states have opened more than 30 charging sites with more than 130 ports, backed by the federal funds, according to Paren.
States receive the funding and manage their own EV infrastructure programs that comply with federal requirements, like they do with roads and bridges.
They have received nearly half — about $2.4 billion — of the EV charging program’s funds, according to Atlas Public Policy. The full $5 billion was already approved as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
“Congress really doesn’t need to do anything for the program to continue,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy. “A lot of funding is going out the door. A lot of construction is underway, and I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.”
That's promising. But we'll find out more in January.
GM Energy ChargePoint EV Charging Station
Here's a great example. General Motors and ChargePoint announced today that they are ""are accelerating the deployment of DC fast charging across the U.S. through an incentive program,"" and that will yield 500 ultra-fast charging ports open by the end of 2025.
From a news release:
Many of the new locations will be equipped with ChargePoint’s Omni Port system, which allows vehicles with CCS or NACS charging ports to use any charger, without the need to carry an adapter or dedicate a parking space to a particular connector type. Many of the new locations will feature ultra-fast charging through ChargePoint’s Express Plus platform, capable of charging speeds up to 500kW.
Get excited to see a lot more of those soon.
Will this potential merger allow both Japanese automakers to thrive in the future, or is it too little, too late? And would these two even be good partners with one another? Let us know what you think in the comments.

"Not So Fast On Ebike Licensing Requirements, Say Some NYC Officials",https://www.rideapart.com/news/744254/ebike-licensing-fight-nyc-council/,Delivery workers could potentially be hit hard if licensing and registration are required. Don't they go through enough?,12/25/2024 1:25,"Earlier this week, news arose from New York City that some legislators were pushing a bill that would require e-bike riders to license and register their e-bikes. One quick note: For clarification, I'm talking about electric bicycles; I'm stating this up front because I've seen some other news outlets use ""e-bikes"" to also refer to electric motorcycles.
Anyway, I can't speak for the rest of my colleagues here. But at one time, I delivered food on a motorbike. Not an e-bike, to be clear, or a bicycle; but I did food deliveries on a motorbike. It's the kind of experience that doesn't leave you. If you've ever been a delivery rider, chances are excellent you also have plenty of stories about your time in the food-schlepping saddle.
Naturally, with my past experience, the first thing I wondered about is how such NYC legislation would affect the countless e-bike delivery riders that crisscross the city on a daily basis. And from the sounds of the City Council hearing that took place yesterday, according to Gothamist, I'm far from the only one.
NYC Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said that while the bill's logic with regard to increasing safety was there, enforcement of such a measure would weigh most heavily on delivery riders.
Rodriguez also pointed out that, by his office's count, there have so far been 105 pedestrian fatalities in NYC as a result of collisions with cars, trucks, and other large vehicles. By contrast, he said, only six people (that's a single digit, six) have died after colliding with e-bikes, mopeds, and e-scooters. And it's almost mid-December.
E-bikes have been around for a little while, but are the relatively new kid on the block in the grand scheme of practical urban transportation. So, some confusion and disagreement about how best to regulate them in the public interest is to be expected.
But there are multiple reasons why licensing and registering them doesn't make much (if any) sense. Do you also license and/or register your regular bicycle? No, you do not. Before e-bikes, plenty of delivery riders were using those to commute, too. E-bikes may have democratized delivery riding a bit more, because they allow even riders who aren't in peak physical condition to go out and do the thing.
This is pure anecdata, but I've seen plenty of unsafe bicycle riding during my years of riding bicycles, e-bikes, and more powerful motorbikes that do (and should) require licensing and registration. And I'm sure you have, too.
The thing that both pedal-bicycle and e-bike riders have in common is that they probably don't want to crash any more than you do. Why? Because in both cases, they're very likely going to be the ones to get seriously injured or even killed.
The lives of delivery riders are stressful enough. At either end, you're at the mercy of two sets of people with two sets of expectations: Whatever restaurant or service you're delivering the food for, and the customers you're delivering the food to. In between, you have what amounts to a platform-style video game full of obstacles you have to successfully traverse in order to get the food to the customer in a timely matter, undamaged, and hopefully at a reasonable temperature.
If you live in the US, you also know that we're a tipping culture, with tipped minimum wages that vary in different areas. In NYC, as of January 1, 2024, the tipped food service worker minimum wage is now $10.65 per hour with a $5.35 tip credit. Tipped service employees must receive $13.35 per hour by law, with a $2.65 tip credit.
How does that impact third-party food delivery service workers, though? NYC regulates third-party food delivery apps, so your Seamless and your DoorDash and your Uber Eats delivery workers all must get at least $19.56 per hour, before tips. For some perspective, as of May 2024, a person living in NYC would need to make a little over $40 an hour to afford fair market rent on a one-bedroom apartment.
TL;DR: Milking blood from a stone doesn't work.

Lucid Wants More Partners. It's Currently In Talks With 'A Couple',https://insideevs.com/news/744828/lucid-more-oem-partners-wanted/,Lucid's CEO said the EV manufacturer is in talks with “a couple” of automakers. One of them could be Hyundai's Genesis.,12/18/2024 7:15,"Although Lucid Motors is a startup with much less car-making experience than traditional OEMs, it has quickly become an electric vehicle technology leader. It’s willing to share its EV tech with others and it’s already helping Aston Martin create its own bespoke EV platform. However, it also wants to find more automakers to partner with.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the company was currently in talks with “a couple” of automakers, but he didn’t name names—one of them is probably Genesis. He said, “It would be lovely if we could supply technology to a traditional car company to help them on their way to sustainability, and perhaps we can leverage economies of scale with their parts bin and other aspects of the business.”
In other words, Lucid would be interested in supplying its EV tech and expect to gain know-how from its potential partners. This doesn’t apply to its deal with Aston Martin, which is one-sided for now, but Lucid expects to earn more than just money from its future partnerships. Aston Martin will launch its first EV, which will have Lucid tech and know-how, in 2026, and it says it has several EVs in the pipeline.
Lucid isn’t the only EV startup looking for established OEM partners. Rivian set up a multi-billion dollar joint venture deal with Volkswagen to develop electric vehicles. VW has pledged to invest close to $6 billion, and the partnership’s first vehicles are expected to debut in 2027. Apparently, a Volkswagen EV prototype is already running on a Rivian platform with Rivian tech.
Volkswagen also owns the Scout EV brand, so it’s not entirely unreasonable to suggest that the upcoming Scout Terra and Traveler may have some components in common. That will make the fact that Scout and Rivian are not the same company even less apparent.
Lucid’s in-house-developed electric motors and 900-volt platform allow it to make some of the most efficient electric vehicles in the world. The startup lacks knowledge about scaling up production into the hundreds of thousands, which is where the experience provided by an established automaker would be very useful.
More Lucid Stories
Now in the process of ramping up production of its second model, the Gravity full size SUV, Lucid will then move on to preparing the start of production for its third model. This will be a smaller and more affordable midsize electric SUV, whose starting price will be around $48,000, so it should sell in higher volumes than any of its current models—the cheapest Lucid right now is the Air Pure, which starts at $71,400, but you can pay over $250,000 for a top-spec Air Sapphire.
Peter Rawlinson previously said that Lucid is aiming to sell 1 million vehicles annually, and it’s banking on not one but two midsize electric crossovers to get there. This year, it produced around 10,000 vehicles, so it's got a long way to go to achieve the stated goal.",Andrei Nedelea
The 2025 Rivian R1S Is The Safest Large SUV Tested By The IIHS This Year,https://insideevs.com/news/744838/2025-rivian-r1s-top-safety-pick-plus-iihs-rating/,The refreshed EV is the only large SUV to get the coveted safety rating this year.,12/18/2024 6:52,"The updated Rivian R1S is now the safest large SUV on American roads, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). During the latest crash testing session, the 2025 R1S got a Top Safety Pick+ rating, the highest possible for a production vehicle that goes through the IIHS testing procedure.
The result is an improvement from the previous iteration of the Rivian R1S, which got a Top Safety Pick rating. The 2025 R1S got Good ratings on all the subcategories except for the Headlights which were rated as Acceptable by the IIHS.
By contrast, the 2022 to 2024 R1S had a Marginal rating for the updated Moderate overlap front crash test, an Acceptable rating for the standard pedestrian front crash prevention and a Poor rating for the seat belt reminders. The headlights were rated as Good.
More EV Safety Stuff
In the updated Moderate overlap front crash test, the 2025 Rivian R1S received Good ratings across the board, except for the driver leg/foot protection, where it was rated as Adequate. In this test, the vehicle travels at 40 miles per hour into a stationary barrier with 40% of the vehicle’s front overlapping. There are dummies in the front driver’s seat and the left rear seat, and the non-profit organization measures the impact forces recorded by the dummies during the crash. The IIHS said Rivian made modifications to the front body structure and rear seats to improve occupant safety in frontal crashes.
In the headlights department, where the updated R1S was rated worse than its predecessor, the IIHS said that visibility was good with both the low and high beams but that the low beams created some glare.
To receive a Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS, a vehicle must get a Good rating in the small overlap front test, an Acceptable or Good rating in the updated moderate overlap front test, a Good rating in the updated side test and an Acceptable or Good rating for both the headlights and the pedestrian front crash prevention test.
In total, there are 48 vehicles with a Top Safety Pick+ award for this year, including the 2024 Rivian R1T pickup, Tesla Model Y, Genesis Electrified GV70, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Subaru Solterra, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Genesis Electrified G80.",Iulian Dnistran
"Zeekr 7X Electric SUV Lands In Europe Starting At €52,990",https://insideevs.com/news/744747/zeekr-7x-europe-pricing/,"This Geely-owned, Chinese brand has big plans for Europe.",12/17/2024 17:00,"Zeekr was founded in China in, 2021 aimed at both local rival Nio and EV juggernaut Tesla. It was conceived as a global brand, and it’s already present outside China, including in Europe. Now, it's opened European order books for its third, and largest, model, the Zeekr 7X.
The 7X is built on the same Geely SEA 800-volt platform as many other of the group’s models, but it’s most similar in size and footprint to the Smart #5. That’s not a coincidence because it’s built on the same PMA2+ variation of the platform as the Smart. For American context, it's about the size of a Honda Prologue. There’s also a sedan equivalent to the 7X, the 007, but it’s unavailable outside China yet.
Deliveries of the 7X are expected to commence around the middle of 2025. There are four available paint options and optional 20-inch wheels that replace the standard 19s. All cars get a standard Nappa leather interior and a large 16-inch infotainment screen. The latter can be complemented by a 36.2-inch augmented reality head-up display.
The Zeekr 7X can be ordered in Europe with either a 75-kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack, which gives the vehicle a claimed WLTP range of 298 miles (480 kilometers), or a 100-kWh NMC pack that extends the range to 382 miles (615 km). Note that WLTP figures tend to be more optimistic than U.S. EPA numbers. The 7X comes as standard with a single permanent magnet synchronous motor delivering 416 horsepower to the rear wheels, allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 6 seconds.
The optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup bumps power to 637 hp, dropping the benchmark sprint time to 3.8 seconds. All variants have the same top speed of 130 mph (210 km/h), and the same 19 cubic feet (539 liters) of trunk space.
Pricing in Europe for the standard model starts at €52,990 ($55,630 at today's exchange rates) and goes up to €55,990 ($58,800) if you spec the larger battery. The Performance AWD version is the most expensive, starting at €62,990 ($66,150), and if you tick all of the options boxes it'll cost around €70,000 ($73,500). It’s considerably cheaper than its Chinese compatriot, the Nio EL7, which is only marginally larger, and has a starting price in Germany of around €74,000 ($77,700).
The other two Zeekr models available in Europe are the €59,940 ($62,950) 001 fastback and the €42,490 ($44,600) X. The latter is Zeekr’s version of the Volvo EX30, sharing its underpinnings, powertrain and battery. Zeekr recently took control of Lynk & Co—another Geely brand—since there was some overlap between the two.
We recently drove a Zeekr 7X in China and we'll have a review of it here shortly. Spoiler alert: We really liked it.

It Begins: Honda And Nissan Reportedly Starting Merger Talks,https://www.motor1.com/news/744769/honda-nissan-merger-talks-rumor/,The two will allegedly operate under a new holding company.,12/25/2024 1:25,"Nissan and Honda are reportedly about to begin talks of merging. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, which cites no specific sources, the two will operate under a new holding company, with the specific details to be decided later. The new group will also allegedly look to include Mitsubishi in the future.
Nissan and Honda began working together in March 2024, expanding their partnership in August to include Mitsubishi as the three agreed to develop electric vehicles and software jointly. Nissan owns a 24 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
Neither Nissan nor Honda would confirm the report's allegations to Reuters, telling the publication that the two are ""exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths.""
And Nissan certainly needs the help.
This year has not been kind to the Japanese automaker, with the company cutting production of its best-selling vehicle while asking dealers to sell cars at a loss. Late last month, two unnamed executives told the Financial Times that the company only had 12 to 14 months to survive. Nissan recently tapped former Jeep CEO Christian Meunier to serve as chairman of Nissan America.
The automotive industry is facing unprecedented challenges. There's more competition, more change, and less certainty than ever before. Chinese automakers are edging out Western brands in their home market, with some beginning to see real sales gains in Europe and elsewhere. Electrification is another considerable point of disruption, where the industry is chasing Chinese progress, forcing traditional automakers to get creative to stay competitive.

The Dodge Charger Daytona Can't Do A Burnout,https://insideevs.com/news/744640/dodge-charger-daytona-cant-burnout/,"Well, this is a little embarrassing.",12/17/2024 16:00,"The Dodge Charger Daytona is out and the first reviews are finally hitting the streets. Critics seem to love the car, mostly, especially since it's one of the first performance EVs specifically aimed at roping in gearheads away from gas-powered, tire-slaying, row-your-own combustion cars. That's not an easy feat, but as many of those who have already made the switch can tell you—the instant torque delivered by an EV can be far from tame.
But there's one particular quirk about the Charger Daytona that we can't quite overcome. Despite Dodge marketing the Charger as an electrified muscle car, it lacks the ability to perform of the most basic hooning features that any red-blooded, high-performance American coupe should be able to do: a burnout.
News of the missing feature first came to us while skimming through MotorTrend's first drive review of the Charger Daytona. During their time with the car, MotorTrend noticed that (for some unfathomable reason) it was impossible to get the car to do a burnout. No amount of fiddling with the controls and gas pedal could yield a brakestand.
Here's what caught our eye from MotorTrend:
In fact, the Charger Daytona won’t do a burnout. No matter what we tried, the electric Charger stubbornly rejected our efforts to announce its arrival to the world via smoke signals. It’s probably capable of doing one with a line lock feature, but inexplicably that’s the one toy Dodge failed to program in.
Surely that can't be right.
Dodge, the company that just said it was going to save the world from ""lame, soulless, weak-looking, self-driving, sleep-pods"" by giving the world a battery-powered muscle car, wouldn't have made it so that flagship EV was incapable of spinning its rear tires in an impressive cloud of vaporized rubber... right?
Maybe there's a good reason for it. Let's remember here that the Charger Daytona comes exclusively in all-wheel drive. That means dual 335-horsepower motors at the front and rear wheels, creating a combined output of 670 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of instant, electrified torque. That's plenty of power for some big number 11s on the pavement.
We dug into this quirk a bit more to find out exactly what was going on. As mentioned, the Charger Daytona is AWD, so in order to do a traditional burnout, it would need to cut power to the front wheels—which it should be able to do since an EV doesn't need to mechanically separate the front and rear drivetrains given that they are completely separate from one another.
Dodge calls this feature ""Line Lock""—a term that's been around since mid-century in the drag racing scene. Its name is quite literal and refers to locking pressure in the front brake lines of a car to keep pads in contact with the rotors and prevent the front wheels from turning. The driver can then mash the gas pedal and heat up the rear tires before sending the car down the drag strip.
The idea is similar for the Charger Daytona. Turning the feature on would disable power to the front motor to prevent the wheels from turning, lock the front brakes and let the rear motor unleash its full torque output.Hell, Dodge even brags about the ability to ""add in Line Lock for smoky burnouts"" on the website for the Charger Daytona.
But there's just one problem: the Charger Daytona doesn't have the Line Lock feature. In fact, a Stellantis spokesperson confirmed to InsideEVs that Line Lock is not currently available on the Charger Daytona and that the brand didn't have anything to share regarding any future plans for the feature.
Well, folks, I hate to break it to you, but that's the world we're living in. The Dodge Charger Daytona—the world's first mass-produced modern electric muscle car—can't do a burnout. At least not yet, and whether or not it will get an update to add Dodge's Line Lock feature in the future is anybody's guess.
Sure, it can do other cool things. Drift mode gets rowdy and even performs the decoupling of the front electric drive motor. That makes it even more puzzling that Line Lock isn't available for this same function. I know this isn't the end of the world, but it seems like such a missed opportunity to include a basic muscle car feature on what is being marketed as the first modern electric muscle car. Maybe that'll change in the future, but for now, I'm going to go sit in the corner and wonder what we did to deserve this.

"This $15,000 Nissan Kei Car Is Japan's Best-Selling EV",https://insideevs.com/news/744749/nissan-sakura-review/,It's nice to see a cheap car winning.,12/17/2024 15:00,"There's a reason Americans seem increasingly fascinated with Japanese Kei vehicles: It's amazing to see small cars winning. The past two decades have seen Americans completely scorn anything small, cheap and simple, moving towards ever-bigger, ever-more ""premium"" options. That's why our three best-selling EVs are all made by Tesla, a premium brand that claims to be an AI company first. One of them starts at $80,000. In Japan, things are different. The best-selling EV is a $15,000 city car from Nissan.
The Nissan Sakura is a ""Kei"" vehicle, a Japanese designation for vehicles that meet strict size, power and engine displacement rules. That means its power is capped—like all Kei vehicles—at 63 hp, and length is capped at 11 feet, 2 inches. So the Sakura is about 11 feet long, 4.8 feet wide and 5.4 feet tall.
It weighs just under 2,400 lbs, with a 20.0-kWh battery that allows it to go 111 miles on a charge. Note that's a WLTP figure, which tends to be a lot more generous than the EPA cycle used in the U.S. It can charge from 10-80% in about 20 minutes, though, so you can replenish range quickly. There's even vehicle-to-load functionality for powering external electronics.
The Sakura is also super nimble and super cheap. Its turning circle is just 15 feet, and prices start around $15,000 at current exchange rates, with well-optioned examples close to $20,000. You can get it in 15 different color schemes, with two-tone options that add some spunk. It looks cheerful and fun, and Japanese buyers don't seem to look down on small cars the way Americans do.
That's made the Sakura a winning proposition. Our reviewer liked it when he drove it back in 2023, and a new video from AutoTrader U.K. seems to agree. Host Rory Reid—formerly of Top Gear fame—calls it ""delightful."" No wonder Nissan sold 37,140 of them in Japan last year, per Wards Auto, accounting for nearly half of all EV sales in the country. The company had to stop taking orders at one point because demand was so strong.
Reid argues that the Sakura could win some hearts and minds in the U.K. or Europe, but that conversation is purely theoretical. Nissan only sells the Sakura in Japan, and has no plans to expand it for now. It's no surprise that it won't come to the U.S. Tiny, 63-hp Kei cars are not great for America's highway-heavy infrastructure, and cars with under 100 miles of EPA range have typically faired poorly here. Plus, even the city cars better suited to American highways—including the Honda Fit, Mitsubishi Mirage and Ford Fiesta—have all been killed off here.
We don't deserve the Sakura. But Europe does. Reid is right that there's a real opportunity for Nissan to win over some buyers there. It's unlikely to be the sort of smashing success it is in Japan, but Europe has a notable appetite for city cars, and Nissan has a notable dearth of exciting products. It's finally got a winner in its hand, now it just needs to double down.

Jaguar’s Secret Weapon For Selling Its Controversial New EVs: Podcasts,https://insideevs.com/news/744715/jaguar-new-ev-podcast-ownership-experience/,"“People buy cars for their design and interior. Powertrain is about 13th on the list,” said Rawdon Glover, Jaguar’s managing director.",12/17/2024 14:00,"It’s safe to say that Jaguar’s reincarnation is quite controversial. From the initial advertising campaign that had precisely zero cars in it to the bulky, muscular pink concept car revealed recently–it’s a stark contrast to what Jaguar used to be.
But it’s all on purpose, as the British automaker’s managing director said in an exclusive interview with TopGear. Not necessarily because Jag was in a bit of a slump, but because customers wanted something different. ""The clients told us you've got to change the brand and the whole ownership experience,” said Rawdon Glover, Jaguar’s MD.
We’re talking about muscular, raw-looking all-electric cars that have very little–if everything–in common with the maker that used to be known for models like the I-Pace, XJ and classic E-Type. Jag even took a sort of sabbatical year off before producing a single car from its all-new lineup, so expectations are very high. The mentality behind selling cars also needs a fresh start, but how will that entail, exactly?

Podcasts, believe it or not, will play a big part in convincing people that a new electric Jaguar will be worth their attention and hard-earned money. ""Buyers want to be treated like an insider. They'll have podcasts of Gerry [McGovern, design head], our engineers, access to information that they wouldn't otherwise get. They're joining a community."" That sounds good in theory, but we’ll have to wait and see how it pans out.
The design will also play a major role in Jag’s reinvention. ""We think there's white space not just in price, but for a brand that's being more disruptive,” Glover said for TopGear. “People buy cars for their design and interior. Powertrain is about 13th on the list."" As a reminder, Jaguar’s upcoming grand tourer will cost around $150,000, slotting between the Lucid Air and Rolls-Royce Spectre. ""They're going to buy it because they think it's beautiful and the brand resonates,"" added Jaguar’s managing director.
Sticking with the design theme, Glover had some cheeky comments about competitors’ choices, saying that many EVs today look like bars of soap because of aerodynamics. “You end up with vehicles that don't have emotional resonance,” said Glover. “We've made the antidote. It's completely different. It's going to have incredible presence on the road.""",Iulian Dnistran
Is Tesla Model S Free Lifetime Supercharging Deal Worth It?,https://insideevs.com/news/744613/tesla-model-s-lifetime-supercharging/,"The Model S now comes with free Supercharging for life, but at the cost of a raised price tag. Let's figure out if it's worth the extra",12/17/2024 13:00,"Tesla is really pushing the Model S hard this holiday season. While the car has never been a volume seller like the Model 3 and Model Y, it's Tesla's OG luxury sedan—and an impressive one at that. But more and more competition for luxury EVs has entered the market over the last few years, and Tesla's take-rate is down by an estimated 30% or more. That means that selling customers on the Model S over rivals has been more of a chore for Tesla than before.
Recently, Tesla decided to pull the gloves off and use its biggest asset to its advantage: the Supercharging network. Tesla dug deep into its old playbooks and revived the unlimited lifetime Supercharging perk, which means that the buyer of a new Model S would get—you guessed it—free unlimited Supercharging for as long as they own the Model S. But before Tesla did that, it also raised the price of the Model S from $74,990 to $79,990 ($5,000) late last week. That makes us wonder: is the deal really as good as it sounds?
To figure it out, we did some basic napkin math. Before we dig into the numbers, we need to know just how efficient the Model S is (at least on paper). The EPA efficiency of the 2024 Tesla Model S All Wheel Drive is 3.6 miles per kilowatt-hour. The Model S Plaid with 21-inch wheels is less efficient at 2.8 miles/kWh.
The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 86% of EV owners have access to a home charger. Of those owners, the agency estimates that approximately 80% of all charging is performed at home. Looking at my own charging stats for the past year, 83% of my charging was done at home—so let's assume the DoE's figures are correct.
The Federal Highway Administration says that the average driver puts around 13,476 miles on their car each year (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm), which means that the average Model S would use around 3,743 kWh of electricity. Only 749 kWh of that energy would be from Supercharging, according to the DoE's figures.
Tesla doesn't list its average base rate for Supercharging, but a quick look around its map has rates ranging from $0.25 to $0.60 per kWh. Let's average that out to $0.43/kWh. For 749 kWh of electricity, the average owner would spend around $322 per year on Supercharging. This means that it would take 15.5 years of driving to fully realize the $5,000 cost hike with the lifetime of free Supercharging. Anything after that would be a net positive, as long as you don't take depreciation into account.
Now, let's talk about that in miles. For the drivers who adhere to the 80-20 charging split and travel the national average, the cost savings start to kick in when the car hits around 210,000 miles on the odometer. Can a Model S do that? Sure—and then some. But the real value here is for those 14%-ers who don't have access to charging at home. That $5,000 price hike starts to pay for itself in just 42,000 miles of Supercharger-only driving.
Now, sure, there are going to be some folks who decide that they'll use this perk to exclusively Supercharge their car. According to the DoE's projections, that could account for as much as 14% of owners right off the bat. If these owners would charge all 3,743 kWh from Superchargers, it would mean a savings of around $1,610 per year, which achieves cost-neutrality in just over three years. Over the same length of 15.5 years, someone who charges their 2024 Model S AWD would have a savings of around $19,950 after the $5,000 price hike.
So, is it worth it? Well, that's for you to decide. If you've been looking at a Model S and don't mind paying the extra price for the unlimited Supercharging trade-off, then, sure. But be warned: unlimited Supercharging is bound only to that vehicle under one person's account, so it won't transfer with the sale of the vehicle. It also doesn't include idle fees or congestion fees and Tesla says it can revoke free Supercharging ""in the event of excessive charging""—so maybe don't hinge making your entire car payment on driving for Uber or Lyft.",Rob Stumpf
Lamborghini Is Delaying Its First EV Like Everyone Else,https://www.motor1.com/news/744579/lamborghini-delays-first-ev-2029/,The production-ready Lanzador will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028.,12/25/2024 1:25,"Several automakers within the last year have altered their electrification plans. Slowing growth is forcing companies like Volvo, Bentley, Ford, and others to reconsider their strategies and rejigger their launch schedules, including Lamborghini. The Italian company now plans to delay the launch of its first EV by a year, according to the CEO.
Lamborghini boss Stephan Winkelmann told reporters this week that the EV will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028, according to Reuters. Winkelmann said he did not believe 2029 was too late to launch an EV, adding that the company does not think the segment will be ready for EVs by 2026.
The automaker is also waiting for potential changes to the European Union’s combustion engine ban set for 2035, when a review takes place in 2026. Lamborghini has also expressed interest in the potential for synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines in new vehicles.
""We think this is the right way to face the future,"" Winkelmann said. ""There are discussions around synthetic fuels and this is an opportunity for our kind of cars"".
The automaker’s first EVs won’t be a supercar. Instead, it’ll be a four-seat grand tourer previewed by the Lanzador concept in 2023. Winkelmann said earlier this year that electric supercars weren’t selling well, and might never truly entice consumers.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X Just Got A Lot Cheaper,https://insideevs.com/news/744726/2025-toyota-bz4x-pricing-specs/,"Toyota's sole U.S. electric vehicle is up to $6,000 less expensive for 2025.",12/17/2024 11:30,"I think that it's fair at this point to say the Toyota bZ4X has a bit of a reputation. The sole electric offering in the U.S. from Toyota, itself an electric-car skeptic, has less range and slower charging speeds than many comparable rivals. But if you want an EV from a trusted brand and you're after a good deal, the bZ4X has consistently proven to be a solid choice.
Mere days after announcing some aggressive new lease and 0% financing deals—the latter of which are nearly impossible to find in the current economic climate—Toyota revealed the 2025 bZ4X's pricing and features. While it didn't get the boost in charging speeds or range that many fans wanted, it's now quite a bit cheaper.
As before, the bZ4X comes in two trim levels: XLE or the loaded Limited. Both can be had in front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive forms with up to 252 or 228 miles of range, respectively. But now there's also a Nightshade trim in the middle that adds 20-inch black alloy wheels, available two-tone paint, a heated steering wheel and other all-black touches. This trim level ""adds more standard driver assistance technology on the Limited grade including Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist and Front Cross Traffic Alert,"" Toyota said in a news release. The Nightshade trim is also AWD-only.
2025 Toyota bZ4X Nightshade Edition
The real news here is pricing. The basic XLE FWD starts at $37,070, which is 14% cheaper than last year's model. The XLE AWD grade’s MSRP starts at $39,150 now too. That's about $6,000 less expensive than before. Moreover, the Limited grade starts at $41,800 in FWD form, cutting $5,380 off the old car's price tag.
All told, this puts the bZ4X on par with a nicely-equipped RAV4 Hybrid and slightly cheaper than a RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid, and on par with your average gas RAV4's pricing. The bZ4X has seen a series of price cuts since its debut in 2022, and now may be the best time to get one.
But that's only part of the story. We consistently see impressive lease and regional discounts and deals on the bZ4X, so if you are after one, do your homework—you could end up paying even less than the official new pricing.
2025 Toyota bZ4X
The bZ4X is limited by its so-so technology and mid-tier fast-charging speeds, which max out at 150 kW. The EV should charge from ""a low battery warning"" to 80% in about 30 minutes, but some users have reported taking about an hour to do so. It also won't automatically add charging stops to your route on longer trips, or allow you to precondition the battery for charging. On the plus side, it's a surprisingly fun-to-drive electric crossover that's dynamically much more interesting than your average RAV4, and it's pretty capable for gear-hauling.
Keep an eye on the deals in your area if you're interested in the bZ4X. You may just be able to wrangle a solid-driving EV for not a lot of money, especially when you factor in gas savings.

Trump Pitches A Complete U-Turn On Federal Support For EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/744636/trump-ev-policy-changes-2025/,"Plus, automakers slash EV prices to meet EU targets and Mercedes reflects on its shrinking market share in China.",12/17/2024 10:54,"As Biden's presidential term comes to an end, the torch is being placed back into Trump's hands for the next four years. The incoming administration's transition team is readying a sweeping set of policy changes that are more akin to a U-Turn than fostering progress, and a huge focus of the Trump team is on electric cars. Unlike the Biden administration, Trump isn't so hot on the idea of subsidizing the EV industry, and that means a number of policy changes could undo the headway made by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Trump's official plans for EVs during his incoming term, the surprising strategy automakers are taking to meet EU's 2025 emissions requirements, and a glimpse into what happens if Mercedes can't grow market share in China. Let's Jump in.
After weeks of speculation and what-ifs following the U.S. presidential election, the future of the country's EV strategy has finally been spelled out in black and white.
Reuters recently got an exclusive look at the recommendations drawn up by president-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Let's just say it's a masterclass in ripping up the roadmap, lighting it on fire and then burying it in the backyard. The plans include cutting off federal support for EVs and charging infrastructure, tariffs on critical battery materials and rolling back emission standards that have been pushing the envelope forward on EV adoption.
First up is the call to eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit. Rumors of this being on the chopping block have existed for months, but it seems all but written in stone now. While this will undoubtedly hurt some consumers by making models unaffordable at full price, it's also pulling the rug out from underneath of automakers that have already invested billions by breaking ground on domestic factories just to qualify for the tax credit.
Domestic-ification is still clearly important. The team says that it plans to recommend tariffs on battery materials from all countries—not just China—in an attempt to boost domestic production. Reuters says that the document recommends negotiating individual exemptions with certain trading partners.
It doesn't stop there, either. That critical funding being used to prop up the nation's EV charging infrastructure? Gone. Instead, the incoming administration is recommending that that money be redirected to national-defense priorities like securing battery minerals and components independent of China. The Trump team is sending a clear signal that defense priorities are a non-negotiable while the consumer side of EVs will just work itself out.
And, of course, there's the rollback of emission standards. The Trump team is reportedly looking to revoke the fuel economy standards set under the Biden administration, and will allow for 25% more tailpipe emissions. California is also set to lose its ability to set clean air regulations for the states that follow its guidance across the country, assuming the administration can win what will surely be a long court battle on that front.
This all spells bad news for the accelerated adoption of EVs across the country. Consumers are left to fend for themselves to drive up adoption while automakers, who have already lit piles of cash on fire to align with the outgoing administration's guidance, have seeming done it for naught. As for manufacturing, automakers have been preparing for a domestic focus on electrification, but the supply chain might not be ready for the shock about to be imposed on it.
Buckle up, folks, because the next chapter of the move to EVs is going to be bumpy.
Europe's automakers are in a tough spot right now. Europe's new carbon dioxide emission rules go into effect next month. That means shuffling the deck to ensure they sell more EVs and fewer ICE cars to reach a fleet-wide ratio that puts them in compliance with new rules—and it looks like it's resulting in a surprising benefit to would-be EV buyers.
The new emission requirements dictate specific fleet-wide CO2 targets that automakers need to achieve  by next year in order to avoid racking up heavy penalties. This means hitting a sales ratio of at least 20% EV-to-ICE. The problem is, automakers aren't anywhere near that just yet. In fact, EV sales made up just 13% of new passenger car sales in Europe in 2024 so far. So with shrinking subsidies and weak demand for battery power, car manufacturers know they need to take drastic measures.
Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault have all taken on the same strategy to become compliant: lower EV prices. I know that sounds like a no brainer, but it comes with an asterisk. Not only are EV prices going down, but combustion prices are going up. That means lowering the barrier of entry to electrification and narrowing the gap to achieve closer price parity for the consumer. The hope is that this is enough to push on-the-fence buyers into enough EVs to hit that sweet 20% target.
This plan has been seemingly in the works for months. For example, Volkswagen lowered the price of the all-electric ID.3 below $31,500 (30,000 EUR) in October with the caveat that all new purchases would be delivered after January 1st—after the new rules take affect. However, these types of discounts are projected to hit automaker's bottom line hard. It's estimated that these discounts alone could cost the industry a combined $5.1 billion.
As for price hikes, we're not talking thousands, here. Renault and Peugeot recently hiked the price of some gas powertrains a few hundred Euros while keeping hybrid prices steady, which is likely a similar approach that other OEMs will take. It would seem that automakers may not just be looking to incentivize EV sales, but also hedge their bets just in case that emission target can't be met.
After all, for every 1 gram of CO2 per kilometer over Europe's threshold, automakers will be fined roughly $100 (95 EUR) per vehicle sold.
In theory, using a consumer's wallet to influence their purchasing decisions is a proven tactic. Everybody loves a good deal, and those who have been considering an EV but wary over higher prices may decide that it's finally time to bite the bullet as price parity grows closer—even if that happens artificially. But for automakers this isn't about starting a price war. They can choose to either light money on fire by paying regulatory fines, or light money on fire to achieve a greater road presence with its EVs. Which would you choose?
Mercedes-Benz is losing its footing in the Chinese EV market. That probably sounds familiar, and it should considering that China's domestic auto market has exploded over the last decade. Many non-Chinese players are quickly finding out that they can't easily compete against even the newest players that have entered the market. Now Mercedes' works council chief says that a failure to regain this crucial market could be a ""fatal"" blow to the brand.
""We would not be satisfied with any less than two million cars a year—we need that to use our German sites to capacity,"" Mercedes works council chief Ergun Lumali told local news on Monday. ""It would be fatal if we as a company relied on significantly lower numbers in the long-term.""
Lumali's two million figure refers to the brand's total annual passenger vehicle output, which is down 14.3% from its 2019 sales figures of nearly 2.4 million units. Mercedes' global sales have been declining since that peak, the only exception being a slight uptick of 3,300 units year-over-year in 2023. Analysts believe that one of the main reasons the brand is seeing a decrease in sales is weakness in the Chinese EV market, its sales training behind other luxury marques like BMW.
CEO Ola Kaellenius planned for lower volumes. In 2020, Kaellenius made the decision to push Mercedes more upmarket. This was expected to cut costs up to 20% by 2025, which would help to pad profits while cutting down on overall sales volume. Unfortunately, that seems to have backfired, as luxury EVs haven't taken off like Kaellenius projected, especially since domestic manufacturers are offering more bang-for-buck when compared to luxury imports from Germany and elsewhere.
""We need growth, growth, growth,"" said Lumali, pointing blame at leadership's misguided plans. ""New strategies are needed.""
Here's the thing—it's not just luxury names that are suffering. Even blue-collar U.S. brands like General Motors have found that China is becoming so competitive that it had to take a $5 billion hit. Japanese brands are struggling too as they've been absolutely trounced by China's home-grown EV manufacturers over the past few quarters. The stronghold that global brands have on China is flatlining and that's a big, big problem for the brands that rely on the market for a vast majority of their sales volume.
Mercedes sold just under 1.5 million cars during the first three quarters of 2024. It expects to close out the year with less than its 2023 sales of 2,043,800 units—and as Lumali pointed out, if the brand wants to keep factory output at a sustainable level for workers and income, it needs to find a strategy that increases volume substantially in a very short time.
With the Trump transition team's plans being all but solidified, it seems that EV buying is transitioning into a seller's market for...well, for as long as the EV incentives like the EV tax credit can be utilized. While the team itself hasn't expressed when it plans to recommend these changes, Trump has made his desire to clear that his intention is to move forward with administrative policy changes very early on after inauguration.
This puts the purchase of a new EV on a time clock for many buyers. And for others—maybe those who don't need a new car but would like one—if they don't act sooner rather than later, they could miss out on a $7,500 discount.
So will you move forward with a new EV purchase in the near future given these policy changes? Let me know in the comments.

Honda Prelude Hybrid Will Come To The U.S. In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/744630/honda-prelude-confirmed-producton-coupe/,Honda says the hybrid coupe will bring the fun back to driving with S+ Shift. And Americans won't be missing out.,12/17/2024 10:00,"We don’t always talk about non-plug-in hybrids here at InsideEVs, but when it happens, it's usually for a good reason. The Honda Prelude Concept was one of those “good reasons”. Last year, Honda surprised everyone at the Toyko Auto Salon (and again at the LA Auto Show) with a thinly-veiled hybrid coupe concept wearing a familiar name.
This year, Honda surprises us again, just in time for Christmas. Honda’s sporty coupe will be making a return for sure, by late next year—including to the U.S. market. Hallelujah.
The Prelude will be more than just a Civic-based hybrid coupe, though. Honda says that this model will mark a new start of performance-oriented sport hybrid technology, through a feature called “S+ Shift”. We don’t know much about the explicit details, but Honda says it will “advance Linear Shift Control to deliver maximum levels of driver engagement, in keeping with the heritage of the Prelude line.”
From that description, I can’t help but think it could be a production version of Honda’s virtual shifting program I saw this past fall in Tokyo. Honda had it applied on a prototype Honda E, but it was open about its plans to port this gamified tech to other future models in its stable.
Like other Honda hybrids, the Prelude will use the same two-motor gas-electric hybrid system. In this design, a traditional automatic or manual transmission isn’t really possible. But, because the two-motor system has a lot of versatility in how it uses its large electric motors in lieu of a transmission, it should mean that a true PHEV isn’t necessarily out of the question. In many European markets, the CR-V Hybrid is available as a PHEV. Similarly, the Accord Hybrid is also PHEV in China. Could a Prelude PHEV be a simple jump away? Maybe.
Regardless, the Prelude comes at a historic time for Honda. Honda is celebrating the 25 year anniversary of its first hybrid car, the Insight. It also recognized that the Prelude was integral to Honda’s original 1970’s launch.
“The first three products in the Honda lineup in the 1970s were Civic, Accord and Prelude, and soon all three will be back together again in our passenger car lineup as hybrids,"" said Jessika Laudermilk, assistant vice president of Honda Auto Sales.
Honda is still calling the Prelude a concept, but it did send over a few new images of the coupe pained up in a very appropriately festive red. Expect the production model to look pretty close to what we see here when it goes on sale next year.

French Government Slashes EV Incentives Amidst Budget Constraints,https://www.rideapart.com/news/744270/france-slashes-ev-incentives-budget-constraints/,"Electric cars have their subsidies reduced, but EV two-wheelers and micro-mobility devices lose them altogether.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Recent years have seen a massive boom in electric mobility, particularly electric motorcycles and scooters. It was a two-way arrangement, really, as manufacturers were eager to jump on an emerging trend. Meanwhile, governments all over the world were quick to incentivize these EVs in a bid to encourage more sustainable mobility.
Unfortunately, the landscape has changed quite a bit. And now, we’re seeing a lot of e-bike, e-scooter, and e-motorcycle manufacturers go under. It also looks like things for the lightweight EV sector aren’t getting any better, at least not just yet.
You see, over in France, the government just rolled out Decree No. 2024-1084, and it’s one that’ll surely have EV enthusiasts disgruntled. The new decree covers quite a lot of electric mobility options ranging from cars to motorcycles and even bicycles, but in a nutshell, it either significantly reduces or completely eliminates the government subsidy for the purchase of electric vehicles.
EV adopters could previously enjoy subsidies of up to 7,000 euros for the purchase of an electric car.
When it comes to new electric passenger cars, the subsidy will now only be from 2,000 euros to 4,000 euros (about US $2,098 to $4,196), as against the previous 4,000 euros to 7,000 euros (about $4,196 to $7,343)—quite a hit for folks looking to save a few bucks by going electric.
But it gets worse.
The new decree completely removes the incentive, also known as an ecological bonus, for both electric two- and three-wheeled vehicles. Electric bicycles, like the super utilitarian e-cargo bikes and ultra-practical electric commuter bikes, are part of the equation, too. And apart from being a total wet blanket for active mobility enthusiasts, this could have a massive negative effect on the European bicycle industry.
Indeed, industry experts were quick to point out that what the government has done is essentially a death sentence to many up and coming e-bike manufacturers that have called France home. Back in 2017, when the subsidies were first introduced, the bicycle market saw a doubling of sales, as bikes—both electric and otherwise—became more accessible than ever before.
Electric cargo bikes have grown in popularity in France and other parts of Europe.
In an article by Bike Europe, the Alliance for Cycling expressed its disdain on the elimination of subsidies for electric two-wheelers in France. In a statement, it said: “The subsidy program is crucial for the cycling industry in France which is making significant steps forward to relocate the production. The bicycle industry is currently in difficulty, with a 24 percent decline in bicycle production volumes in France compared to 2022, and bicycle sales are down by 13 percent.”
And as for why the French government is slashing its EV incentives all of a sudden, well, according to Reuters, the move is part of a wider range of initiatives geared to control additional expenses due to budgeting constraints moving into 2025. It’s a bad situation that’s making an already unfavorable situation worse for pretty much the entire EV industry.
What’s scary here is that governments, organizations, and businesses alike all over the world are always looking for ways to cut costs. And perhaps, France cutting EV subsidies sets a massive precedent for other countries to follow suit. We’re expecting a similar move in the US—perhaps one that’s even worse, once Trump takes office on January 20, 2025.
So, to any EV enthusiasts reading this story, it certainly looks like things are gonna get a bit more difficult for you guys in the near future. If you're in France, or you otherwise have thoughts about this change in policy, share them in the comments below.

But while checking out the registration data for all EVs in the United States–you can read more about the bigger picture here–I noticed something peculiar. Toward the bottom of the list, two unlikely names were battling it out, and the winner of this bottom-of-the-barrel competition was surprising.
According to registration data from S&P Mobility Global, Fisker moved more electric vehicles than Volkswagen. As a reminder, Fisker went bankrupt earlier this year and its liquidation plan was approved by a judge in October. Meanwhile, Volkswagen is one of the largest carmakers in the world. So how did we get here?
More Stuff Like This
Let’s look at the numbers first. Fisker had 110 EVs registered in the U.S. in October, while Volkswagen had 92. That’s worse than Fiat’s 135 EV registrations but better than Jeep’s 63. It’s not exactly what we’d call outstanding, but there’s an explanation for all of this.
As I mentioned earlier, Fisker’s liquidation was approved by a judge in October. The bankrupt automaker still had roughly 3,000 unsold Ocean electric crossovers in inventory when the plan was approved, and all of them were scooped up by New York-based American Lease. Before the liquidation plan was approved, these cars were still for sale at a handful of dealers across the country, and some of the cars were priced really low. In other words, people could still buy the Ocean EV, often with very high discounts.

2024 Volkswagen ID.4
But what about Volkswagen? For such a large company, VW only sells two electric models in the United States–the American-made ID.4 crossover and the German-made ID.Buzz minivan. However, the ID.Buzz only became available in the U.S. in–you guessed it–October, when the configurator went online. That said, Volkswagen only supplied limited quantities to dealers at the beginning.
That leaves the ID.4, which has traditionally been a solid performer. Volkswagen stopped production of the electric crossover at the Chattanooga plant at the end of September, though. It did that because there’s a recall affecting nearly 100,000 ID.4s in the U.S. for faulty electronic door locks that could open while driving–and there’s no fix. Before stopping production, a stop-sale was issued for the ID.4.
So there you have it. A combination of steep discounts for an EV that’s no longer being manufactured due to the company behind it going bankrupt and a manufacturing pause for an otherwise well-known electric crossover.",Iulian Dnistran
You Can Get A New Fiat 500e With $0 Down And $0 Per Month–With A Catch,https://insideevs.com/news/744664/fiat-500e-0-lease/,"It’s not a scam, even if it sounds too good to be true.",12/17/2024 3:44,"The Fiat 500e is a decent electric city car, but it has one big downside: its price tag. For about $34,000, you only get 141 miles of range, two doors and four seats, which isn’t exactly enticing when the Chevrolet Equinox EV exists. It’s bigger, has more range and costs about the same when you factor in the $7,500 tax credit.
However, there’s a lease deal for the Fiat 500e out there that beats just about everything on the market, simply because it’s free–with an asterisk.
Thanks to tax credits, you can lease the Italian electric supermini with $0 down and $0 per month. If you live in Colorado. And have a credit score above 700. And you also need to consider the sales tax and insurance, but that’s also valid for any other lease out there, so no surprise here.
More Fiat 500e Stories
There’s also just one dealer in Colorado that has this offer, as far as we know, which is even more restrictive for those wanting to get behind the wheel of a brand-new EV for very little money. That said, the maths behind the deal is pretty simple.
When leasing, any new EV is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit. On top of that, the state of Colorado offers an additional $5,000 for new EVs, which brings the incentive total to $12,500. That’s what the dealer is getting, leaving the customer to pay the sales taxes, registration fee and comprehensive insurance.
The Colorado dealer that came up with the $0 lease only has the base Fiat 500e in stock, which comes with automatic air conditioning, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but not much more. The retail price of the car is $34,095 excluding the destination charge. The lease contract is for 27 months and 20,000 miles.
Another added benefit of this deal is customers get a free Level 2 charger or $600 in charging credits. If lessees want to end the lease early, there’s a $395 disposition fee, but that’s about it.
It’s a screaming deal. Yes, the car is not exactly record-breaking by any stretch of the imagination, but for this kind of money, it can be a great little commuter. It’s also worth mentioning that the $7,500 federal tax credit might be going away next year, so keep that in mind if you’re looking for a new EV.",Iulian Dnistran
Shaq Had A Lucid Air Turned Into A Coupe So He Could Fit Inside,https://insideevs.com/news/744608/shaq-lucid-air-coupe-custom/,"When you’re a 7’1’’ former NBA player, normal-sized car doors just don’t cut it.",12/16/2024 15:00,"Shaquille O’Neal has done many things in his career that started in professional basketball and continues today in the entertainment and music industries. He’s amassed an impressive collection of cars, some of which have been modified to accommodate his 7’11’’ frame, and the most recent addition is a unique makeover of a Lucid Air.
Shaq’s Air has been turned into a two-door coupe with considerably larger doors than before. The work was done by West Coast Customs (WCC), the shop made famous by the show Pimp My Ride, and it looks like a thorough job considering it involved extensive structural modifications. The former NBA player didn’t say much about his new car other than the fact that he had it personalized to match his Rolls-Royce Cullinan (also done by WCC).
We can’t quite tell if the shape of the roof has been changed—it looks like it probably wasn’t—because the Air actually looks good as a two-door. Some of the other changes made to the vehicle include large, multi-spoke wheels with self-centering caps featuring the Superman logo and the replacement of the “Lucid” script on the front with “Diesel,” referencing his stage name as a dubstep DJ.
This one-of-a-kind Air isn’t Shaq’s only custom EV. He owns at least two Tesla Cybertrucks with custom carbon fiber widebody kits and massive 26-inch Forgiato wheels. Their transformation isn’t as radical as the Lucid Air, since it didn’t involve changing any of the bodywork, but, at the same time, they look quite different from a standard Cybertruck—they will really get Shaq noticed, unlike the Air coupe, which is a lot more understated in comparison.
Elon Musk even commented on one of the Cybertrucks, saying it was “nice” when Shaq posted a photo of it on X. Will Lucid boss Peter Rawlinson take to X to comment on Shaq's two-door Air? Probably not.
Lucid has no plans to make an Air coupe. The personal luxury coupe market has been consistently shrinking over the last decade as more buyers are moving to high-riding SUVs instead. Lucid itself just launched its second model, the Gravity, which unsurprisingly is a three-row SUV because that’s what sells these days.

"Dodge Charger EV Review: 'Sorry, Dodge, Things Are Not Looking Good'",https://insideevs.com/news/744580/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-review/,Kyle Conner from Out of Spec has many issues with the new electric Dodge Charger Daytona.,12/16/2024 14:00,"Nobody really asked for an electric muscle car that makes fake V8 noises, but Dodge went ahead and made one anyway. The 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV is here now, and it’s not been getting the best reviews. It doesn’t seem clear who and what it’s designed for since it does some things that you wouldn’t expect well while not performing as well as you think it should in other areas, given its muscle car image.
Kyle Conner from the Out of Spec Reviews channel had a lot of things to say about the new electric Charger, and most of them weren’t flattering. He even apologizes to Dodge at the start of the video for what he’s about to say, but he makes plenty of good points that seem to confirm what other early reviewers have said about the car.
The way it looks is not a problem, especially for the two-door body. Dodge has done an excellent job of making an EV look like a muscle car, including giving it a blunt and upright front end. However, while at first glance it may look like a typical muscle car, it hides an aero element similar to what the Polestar 3 has, which is designed to channel air over the car and improve the drag coefficient.
It’s built on the 400-volt Stellantis STLA Large platform, which allows for both electric and combustion powertrains, and in EV form, it has a battery pack with just over 100 kilowatt-hours of gross capacity. The usable capacity is about 94 kWh, which gives the $59,995 R/T variant on 18-inch wheels an EPA range rating of 308 miles (496 km). The $73,130 Scat Pack with more power and larger wheels is rated at 240 miles.
The range numbers are average when compared to other similar vehicles with comparable batteries, but it is a bit on the heavy side at almost 5,700 pounds (2,585 kg) or more than that for the Scat Pack. That heft makes its presence felt when you want to pick up the pace around a twisty road when the car just feels a bit lethargic and inert—even suddenly flooring reveals a delay until full power is delivered, and it doesn’t help the car feel sporty to drive.
Kyle was not kind to the electric Charger, saying it left him “completely disappointed.” He says it has no redeeming qualities, even pointing to its low-speed driving experience, which, in spite of its heft, is deemed “dreadful.” In his view, this car doesn’t even get the EV basics right, and it has additional problems on top of that, but then again, it’s also a brand-new vehicle, and Dodge can still improve it and add features over time.
We'll draw our own conclusions once we get our hands on a Dodge Charger Daytona for our own in-depth review.

Watch How Fast This EV Swaps Its Battery,https://insideevs.com/news/743429/onvo-l60-swap-video-battery/,The Onvo L60 can swap its batteries for fresh ones far quicker than any DC fast charger.,12/16/2024 13:02,"The jury is still out if China (and the rest of the world) is migrating to battery swapping instead of recharging, but I can’t deny that it’s super cool. The complaints about range anxiety related to long waits and long charge times at DC fast chargers vanish because battery swapping is so much faster.
I drove a few new electric vehicles from Nio and its new brand Onvo while in China a few weeks ago. There, I was able to watch and initiate the swaps themselves. This ain’t no joke folks, these batteries swap very quickly — watch in real-time as the car maneuvers itself into the swap station, and removes and replaces its battery — all in less than five minutes.
The car I’m driving in the video is the Onvo L60. Onvo is Nio’s latest brand, a moderately priced EV brand meant for Chinese families. The L60 is tit-for-tat the same size and a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y. However, unlike the Model Y, the Onvo L60’s batteries can be swapped out instead of charging using Nio’s swap stations.
In this video, I’m at a Generation Four swap station. The first one went online this past summer, but notably, these new generation stations are designed to accommodate a wider range of batteries. The Onvo L60 has a slimmer battery made by BYD and only comes in 60 or 84 kWh, compared to the 75, 100, or 150 kWh found in the more upscale Nio vehicles. Also, Nio says there have been some improvements to the stations themselves. Nio says the swap can now happen in as little as 144 seconds.
It’s a very smooth process. After the car backs itself in, it places itself into neutral and does a quick system check. Then, it cuts the car’s main power (the infotainment screen and blower motor will continue to function), raising the vehicle. The battery is removed, and the car is placed back on its wheels. The automated battery cabinet finds a fresh battery, raises the car once more, and installs it. The car does one more self-check as it’s lowered back onto its wheels. When the car’s speedometer and gear selector reappear, it’s time to drive away.
Onvo L60
If we count from the time it took me to maneuver the car into its space and start the swap process, it took three minutes and 44 seconds for the whole swap to take place, including the time the car spent maneuvering itself into the swap station itself. Before I could grasp what was going on, the L60’s battery swap was complete. Even the fastest DC fast charging couldn’t beat this. This might be faster than the last time I got gas. It’s no 144 seconds, but man, it’s pretty damn quick.
Of course, not every swap is perfect. It took me two tries to actually get the car into the swap cabinet, mostly because an impatient driver cut me off while the car was attempting to back itself into the swap station, forcing me to restart the entire process. Still, it’s very impressive.
So, what do you think? Do you want your next EV to have a swappable battery?

Would You Camp Out In This Weird Electric Camper Trike Thing?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/744117/grounded-t1-electric-camper-trike/,"An interesting concept, but one that might be a little too ahead of its time.",12/25/2024 1:25,"I want you to imagine a scenario in the distant future. A future where the great outdoors is no longer a reality, but just an illusion—one that’s constructed within the confines of the underground civilization mankind has built to escape the nuclear apocalypse. Naturally, outdoor recreational things like camping, hiking, and overlanding have become a thing of the past.
But it’s human nature to long for the good old days, and so folks inhabiting this underground settlement have created simulated outdoor environments complete with trees, dirt, and mountains in the distance. Sure, off-roaders and 4x4s are now a thing of the past, but that doesn’t mean that campers need to go extinct. This is where this crazy e-trike camper from a company called Grounded enters the picture.
It’s called the T1, and it’s essentially an electric trike that’s pulling a trailer that doubles as a camper. It’s powered by the Civilized Cycles Semi-Trike platform, and is touted as a first-of-its-kind smart trailer and trike system. So yeah, definitely perfect for camping trips that are confined to a pretty close radius, and without much off-road riding.
Where’s the fun in that?
It boasts a well-appointed cabin with all the essentials.
You get a dining table for two, a sink and counter, and even an optional outdoor shower.
Inside, the Grounded T1 boasts all the amenities you’d hope to find in a mobile home. The concept render features what appears to be a modular dining and living space with enough room to seat two to three adults. At night, the table looks like it could be folded up, and the seats look like they could be turned into a cozy bed for two. There’s a sink, a counter, and even an optional dry-flush toilet and outdoor shower. Heck, you could pretty much live in this thing.
And while this thing just might work in the context of a distant dystopian future, at present, I’m not quite sure who this is actually for.
I mean, on paper, this thing certainly seems capable. It claims a range in excess of 150 miles. It even gets solar panels bolted to the roof, as well as compatibility with Starlink. Heck, you can even control all its features through a proprietary app. [How very 2024!jj]
The main drawback here seems to be that it's confined to pavement and bike paths.
But to be compatible with today’s definition of adventure, the T1 needs just a little bit more capability, at least in my opinion. For starters, it’ll need higher ground clearance in order to be able to tackle any trails or rut-laden gravel roads. It might also need some extra suspension to soak up the bumps, too. On Grounded’s official website, it shows renders of the T1 riding solely on paved bike paths. And while more and more of these are popping up all over the world, there’s no denying that lots of adventurers still want to have the option to go well beyond the confines of pavement.
Oh, and for a starting MSRP of $13,000 USD, it’ll be hard to convince adventurers looking to get the most bang for their buck to splurge on this electric camper trike. Heck, you could get yourself a 2004 Toyota Tacoma for that cash, and still have some dough left over to dress it up with some overland goodies.
But hey, that’s just me. And who knows, maybe there will be a place for an electric camper like the Grounded T1? Maybe even long before the nuclear apocalypse.

How Mercedes’ Craziest Experiment Gave Us Its Most Important EV Yet,https://insideevs.com/news/744433/mercedes-cla-eqxx-technology/,A Mercedes-Benz engineer tells us how the learnings from the record-breaking EQXX led to the upcoming CLA sedan.,12/16/2024 11:00,"Almost three years ago now, Mercedes-Benz showed off something that seemed capable of doing the impossible. Dubbed the Vision EQXX, it had the same size battery as a Mercedes EQS, just 30% lighter and taking up half as much space. Its electric motor was much smaller than most with its power output. It was aerodynamic enough to make a fighter jet look like a school bus.
Put all those innovations together, and Mercedes had a car that could drive 747 miles on a single charge—yes, really—or 627 miles in the heat of a Saudi Arabian desert. And it delivered groundbreaking electric efficiency of up to 8.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, almost twice as good as today’s best EVs.
Mercedes Vision EQXX
At other automakers, this project would have stayed a mere science experiment. Not so at Mercedes-Benz, where one of its top engineers recently told me the car’s technology will directly translate to its most important EV yet: the new CLA-Class.
Timo Stegmaier, Mercedes head of e-drive compact/midsize and system validation, also worked on Mercedes-Benz's groundbreaking EQXX project and has been responsible for bringing many of the learnings from there into the almost production-ready CLA.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
""The world-record EQXX, it was very important for us with the car to influence series production,"" Stegmaier said of the long-tailed prototype machine. ""It was really nice not only doing a showcase with the EQXX, it was pretty cool also here in the CLA.""
The new CLA-Class will be a crucial model for Mercedes-Benz. Its first go at EVs, the EQ-branded sedans and SUVs, didn’t really make a splash in the marketplace as expected. Future Mercedes electric models are now said to look much more like their familiar gas-powered counterparts. And like other automakers, Mercedes is also pushing back its all-electric goals as sales prove uneven.
But it can’t give up on EVs entirely. Mercedes faces intense electric competition in, and now from, China. It has strict emissions and fuel economy standards to meet globally. And the company long known for innovation doesn’t want to cede that leadership to anyone. So the CLA-Class will be the first of several new more compact, ultra-efficient electric sedans, wagons and even large crossovers. And they’ll have hybrid versions featuring batteries paired with a new high-efficiency four-cylinder engine.
Any way you look at it, efficiency is the name of the game here. The EQXX set new records for that on multiple occasions. Much of the technology from EQXX will live on in the CLA in some form or another, but Stegmaier said there have been some improvements, too.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
""The CLA has a similar motor"" to the EQXX, he said, improvements over the powertrain seen in the EQE and EQS covering not only hardware design but softer stuff, like the types of lubricants used within. Stegmaier declined to elaborate on that but said that the fundamental concept of the battery and its electronics, that of ""the one box,"" continues on from the EQXX as well.
With this design, Mercedes engineers placed not only the battery cells and thermal management but much of the charging and controller infrastructure together into a single component. This will surely simplify manufacturing but also optimize space within the Mercedes Modular Architecture, or MMA, the platform that the CLA will roll upon.
Mercedes CLA MMA Platform
It also creates room for a frunk, which previous models like the EQE and EQS have lacked. ""It is a very compact motor out in the front,"" Stegmaier said. ""So the compact design makes it possible to have a really quite cool frunk."" Stegmaier wouldn't give me a specific volume, but by the sound of things, a few groceries or a backpack would be reasonable.
But there'll be other improvements, too, including an energy density from the 85 kWh nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) pack that, Stegmaier says, is 20% higher than the company's previous cells.
The drivetrain configuration is substantially different from the EQ cars, too. While the front motor arrangement is similar, a permanently excited motor with a disconnect, the rear of the CLA relies on a two-speed transmission.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
Stegmaier called this system: ""The heart of efficiency."" Two speeds enable the rear motor to operate efficiently at a greater range of speeds.
Knowing that EV transmissions are a controversial topic—especially whether the additional complexity is worthwhile—I asked whether there was any internal debate about going with this approach for the CLA. ""It's not an easy decision because, as you said, it's also complex and costly,"" he said. ""But we were very clear. We also want to bring that efficiency into the CLA, and there, the two-speed gearbox is absolutely necessary.""
The result is a car that, Stegmaier says, will cover a whopping 5.2 miles per kWh and deliver 93% efficiency. That should trump even the Lucid Air Pure as the most efficient EV around. This performance, he said, actually hampered his team's earlier testing in the Alps.
""There were many times my team was coming up to me and saying, 'We had a problem. We couldn't do any charging tests because we couldn't get the car empty,'"" he said.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
PR-friendly testing problems aside, part of that efficiency in steep terrain is thanks to significantly higher regen rates than previous Mercedes-Benz EVs. The CLA is able to generate up to 200 kW under braking, or almost three times what a Tesla Model 3 can do. Stegmaier declined to say how many Gs the car can sustain under deceleration but did say that the most aggressive of the three regen modes (D, D-, and D+) will be a proper one-pedal experience, with the car coming to a complete stop.
That captured momentum will, of course, help recharge the battery via the car's 800-volt system. When it comes to charging the old-fashioned way, a 320 kW DC charger will enable grabbing 186 miles of charge in just 10 minutes, part of what helped the team cover over 2,300 miles in 24 hours in yet another record-breaking run.
That charging will happen via a Tesla-style NACS plug, while a separate J1772 plug is there for slower duties. And, Stegmaier assured me that the power will flow both ways: ""We will offer bidirectional charging, so you can use the CLA also as storage,"" he said.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
That's a lot of good news for EV owners, but the changes extend beyond the hardware of the new platform. The CLA will display significant software revisions as well, starting with the MB.OS system running in the dashboard.
The software controlling those motors is also improved, something Stegmaier said would be a boon in low-grip conditions, such as the slippery, snowy test ride I got. Even in deep snow, the CLA's dual-motor all-wheel-drive system didn't skip a beat.
Again, much of this is thanks to the learnings from the electric EQXX, but many were surprised to learn that the platform it spawned, MMA, will also be used for a 48-volt hybrid.
Mercedes MMA Platform Hybrid Engine
Mercedes has confirmed they will release an internal combustion version of the CLA, and while that news dropped only recently, Stegmaier said a hybrid was always part of the plan: ""It was from the beginning,"" he said, ""because we want to offer both worlds, both customer needs. So if you go to the shop, you will buy a CLA. The second question will be, which powertrain do you want to choose?""
That, then, raises the question of how these two CLAs will be differentiated in the market. Both will simply be called CLA, with Mercedes-Benz relying on its numerical nomenclature to identify the powertrains, much like with the current G-Class. There, the internal combustion models are G550 or AMG G63, while the electric model is the G580.
Mercedes CLA-Class Specs
I asked Stegmaier if there would be any significant visual differentiators. ""There are little, very little, differences between the hybrid and the electric car,"" he said, suggesting the grille treatment will be the biggest differentiator.
That means you'll be able to see more than a little of the design heritage of the ultra-efficient EQXX EV even in the gas-powered CLA. But where that car featured a dramatic but somewhat impractical shape, with a long tail designed to help aerodynamics, the CLA's shape will be more pert, more practical.
And, if the CLA Concept is any indication, something far more attractive than Mercedes' current EV offerings.

Tesla Model 3 RWD Displays Impressive Efficiency In European Testing,https://insideevs.com/news/744461/tesla-model3-green-ncap-rating/,The green spinoff of Euro NCAP says it “is a reason for Tesla engineers to be proud of their achievement.”,12/16/2024 10:00,"Tesla makes some of the most efficient electric cars on the market, and the most frugal is the Model 3. The pre-facelift Model 3 performed exceedingly well when Green NCAP tested it in 2022. The revised Highland model further improves upon its predecessor and earns the maximum five-star rating.
Green NCAP is run by the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP), and it rates vehicles not for safety but for harmful pollutants emitted and energy efficiency. It puts vehicles through three sets of tests: clean air, efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.
The Tesla Model 3 RWD was given a maximum Clean Air Index of 10.0 and 9.8 for its Greenhouse Gas Index. The Efficiency Index comprises four laboratory tests and four real-world road tests; the Model 3 scored the maximum in all of them, stretching its electrons further than most EVs.
They confirmed the base Model 3 (which, for the European market, where these tests are conducted, is made in China) with the LFP battery has a usable capacity of 60 kilowatt-hours. That’s more than most other estimates, which usually suggest that it has a 60 kW gross capacity with around 57.5 kWh usable.
The highway efficiency test, which is done at the typical European speed limit of 80.7 mph (130 km/h), yielded an impressive 2.98 miles/kWh (20.8 kWh/100 km), allowing it to cover up to 201 miles (324 km) of “dynamic high speed highway driving,” which Green NCAP says is “a new record value.” In mixed driving conditions, it achieved 4.37 miles/kWh (14.2 kWh/100 km), giving it a theoretical maximum range of 295 miles (475 km).
Its lowest consumption figure was achieved in the short urban trip test, where the vehicle averaged 5 miles/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km), allowing it to cover 340 miles (547 km) on a full charge. The car was also praised for its thermal management in the cold weather test, which was able to bring the temperature inside the cabin (specifically around the front headrests) to 64.4°F (18°C) in just 3 minutes after starting from cold with an outside temperature of 19.4°F (-7°C).
The Model 3 RWD got a final score of 98%, which is exactly the same as the recently tested 2024 Hyundai Kona EV, more than the BYD Atto 3 (which also has impressive safety credentials) with 96%, and less than the 2024 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, whose rating was 99%. The latter is the greenest car tested this year by Green NCAP, followed by the electric Kona in second place and the Model 3 in third.

Did General Motors Limit Its Future By Walking Away From Cruise?,https://insideevs.com/news/744467/gm-cruise-cm-sales-december/,"Plus, the auto industry closes out 2024 with a nasty ""hangover"" after riding high during the pandemic.",12/16/2024 10:00,"There's a kind of big-picture way of looking at General Motors' decision to acquire, and less than a decade later, ultimately suspend, its Cruise robotaxi division: what are car companies supposed to be in the future?
Are automakers just going to make individual, privately owned cars in the coming years, decades and even centuries? Or are they going to be, and do, much more than that? Perhaps on a long enough timeline, the future of mobility really will be fully automated pods, or even flying vehicles; I tend to think that if either of those things actually happen, I'll have already been dead for a long time. But if so, who will make those vehicles, and who will usher us into that era? For now, GM has more immediate, short-term problems to deal with, but there are mixed opinions on its recent decision to walk away from the robotaxi business.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of transportation and tech news. Also on tap today: while we're concerned with the future, the auto industry's present isn't in very good shape either. Let's dig in.
GM Cruise Self-Driving Chevy Bolt Stuck In San Francisco (Source: Tesla Owners Silicon Valley/Twitter)
I'll admit we picked an interesting week to name GM CEO Mary Barra as the InsideEVs Person of the Year. I stand by that decision because pivoting an old-school automaker to where it ends the year selling so many electric vehicles is a remarkable achievement—especially as so many others struggle. (More on that in a bit.) Our award process had been in the works for months and wasn't contingent on one week's news cycle.
But Barra's decision to cease robotaxi operations at Cruise and transfer the teams and technology development to passenger cars is a divisive one.
On the one hand, GM sunk more than $10 billion into Cruise since acquiring the company in 2016 and had little to show for it. The robotaxi service largely hit pause on its operations last year amid multiple crashes and high-profile safety mishaps, and I'd argue its reputation never really recovered from that. (I'd also argue that, having been in many Cruise rides myself, the tech was simply not as good as Waymo's autonomous vehicles; more mistakes, less certainty and less overall confidence.) And GM just took a $5 billion hit to restructure its bleak China operations; it had to save money somehow. I'm not shocked this happened at all.
But the other argument is that between losses in China and throwing in the towel on robotaxis, GM is cutting off potential pathways to the future. Here's CNBC on that:
Part of the plan was for GM’s innovation division to identify trillions—yes, trillions—of dollars in new market opportunities such as electric commercial vehicles, auto insurance, military defense, autonomous vehicles and even, eventually, the potential for “flying cars,” also known as urban air mobility.
While GM has declined to disclose how much revenue such businesses have produced, Barra, with the ending of its Cruise robotaxi operations on Tuesday, made it clear that the automaker’s growth priorities have shifted amid a broader, industrywide retrench to preserve capital. Companies including GM are now focused on more “core” operations and adjacent business opportunities, including software, EVs and “personal autonomous vehicles.”
The driverless ride-hailing service was supposed to be the shining star of GM’s growth opportunities, with executives just a few years ago referring to it as an $8 trillion market opportunity that the automaker would lead. That included former executives touting $50 billion in revenue by the end of this decade, and Cruise being valued at more than $30 billion.
Instead, after spending more than $10 billion on Cruise since acquiring it in 2016, GM is ending the robotaxi business and folding Cruise’s operations and an undetermined number of its nearly 2,300 employees into the automaker.
Also, a decade ago, the focus of Wall Street investors and analysts was more around long-term prospects and the ""be more like Tesla"" ethos; these days, it's all about those short term gains. So this part is interesting:
To GM’s credit, Wall Street, which previously pushed for such growth businesses, applauded the decision to end Cruise’s robotaxi ambitions. Shares of the company were initially higher, before ending the week level with when the announcement was made.
GM, like other companies, has quickly shifted from trying to impress Wall Street with growth initiatives, including generating $280 billion in new businesses by 2030, to refocusing efforts on its core business to generate profits amid economic and recessionary concerns.
That's also especially interesting when you consider that Tesla—whose own EV sales have been steadily losing market share, including to GM—has most of its sky-high valuation tied up in the idea that it can one day ""solve"" fully driverless cars.
So, investors want GM to be a car and truck company, and Tesla to unlock the driverless-car future. Do I have that right?
If I do, that really flies in the face of the ""we want to be seen as a tech company"" vibe that so many automakers have pushed over the past decade. If you're not some driver of future technology, you're just a legacy business with low profit margins, high capital and labor costs, destined to duke out inches of market share with the likes of Volkswagen and Nissan forever. And no car company wanted that. But a lot of this just isn't going all that well for many of them, including GM:
GM’s plans to diversify its business through fashionable industries such as ridesharing and other “mobility” ventures — a trendy term used previously by the industry for growth initiatives — or startups have largely fallen flat since the automaker started investing in such growth areas in 2016.
The automaker earlier this year folded its BrightDrop EV commercial vans into Chevrolet amid lackluster sales. It’s also failed to announce any meaningful plans for fuel cells for tie-ups with boats, trains and airplanes, and it’s shuttered several prior “mobility” businesses.
I am glad that story points out the promising potential of GM Energy, because cool things are happening over there. And on this so-called ""personal autonomy"" front, Super Cruise is truly excellent right now, and about the only automated driving assistance system (ADAS) I've used that I really and genuinely trust.
But this whole industry is reckoning with the future, and balancing that with paying the bills in the short-term. I can only wish I knew how to crack that equation.
Between its EV sales, overall profits and bets on the future that are working, GM actually had a better year in 2024 than most. The same, I think, will be said of Hyundai Motor Group and a couple of others. Make no mistake, however: this was a very rough year for the auto industry. Maybe the gloomiest since the lead-up to the Great Recession.
These are issues that frequent Critical Materials flyers will know very well, but the New York Times has a good summary of why this current moment feels so dismal after the car industry saw a surge in sales during the pandemic:
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Emphasis mine, because that's the heart of the problem.
The car business expands and contracts all of the time. Sales skyrocketed a decade ago amid the recovery from the financial crisis, then naturally started slowing by the close of the 2010s; people don't need new cars all of the time. Then people bought like crazy during the pandemic. But that, and the concurrent supply chain issues and pandemic-related inflation, drove prices to their sky-high levels I'd argue they're still at now. Yes, prices have gone down since their peaks, but we're still around $50,000 for average new car prices. Even more so for EVs.
The car industry is really seeing long-term demand declines in Europe, where buyer growth just isn't coming back, and China, where the brands we know are getting crushed by local newcomers. (And China's own car market has its limits as well.)
There just aren't many winners as we close out 2024. Stellantis and Volkswagen? Bad. Nissan? Even worse. Toyota? Doing really well on hybrids—for now—but not so much in China. Ford? Taking some hits after its early innovations in the EV space and shrinking across the world. Even luxury brands are struggling thanks to these same problems. And incoming President Donald Trump promising to nuke the EV tax credits also threatens billions of dollars in planned investments.
It does feel like the car business is poised for contraction more than anything else now—and as that story notes, an ""If you can't beat 'em, join up with them"" approach to China's EV makers.
California is the nation's leader in EVs and a huge driver of cleaner cars everywhere. That's because the state has the power to set its own emissions rules and more than a dozen other states follow those standards too. So its potential plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 has real power.
The fossil fuel industry, some members of the auto industry and conservative politicians have wanted to erase that power for decades, and now the U.S. Supreme Court will have something to say about it too. From The Guardian:
The US Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a bid by fuel producers to challenge California’s standards for vehicle emissions and electric cars under a federal air-pollution law in a major case testing the Democrat-governed state’s power to fight greenhouse gases.
The justices took up an appeal by a Valero Energy subsidiary and fuel industry groups over a lower court’s rejection of their challenge to a decision by Joe Biden’s administration to allow California to set its own regulations.The dispute centers on an exception granted to California in 2022 by the US Environmental Protection Agency to national vehicle emission standards set by the agency under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law.
The high court will not be reviewing the waiver itself, but instead will look at a preliminary issue: whether fuel producers have legal standing to challenge the EPA waiver.
This case won't go to trial until next spring but it's something we'll be watching closely. The petroleum companies' argument is that, essentially, California's waiver exceeds federal power and is also hurting their business:
They said they met the legal test for getting into court. As a “matter of common sense”, lawyers for the companies wrote, automakers would produce fewer electric vehicles and more gas-powered cars if the waiver were set aside, directly affecting how much fuel would be sold.
The current fight has its roots in a 2019 decision by the Trump administration to rescind the state’s authority. Three years later, with Biden in office, the EPA restored the state’s authority.
Valero’s Diamond Alternative Energy and related groups challenged the reinstatement of California’s waiver, arguing that the decision exceeded the EPA’s power under the Clean Air Act and inflicted harm on their bottom line by lowering demand for liquid fuels.
Won't someone please think of the oil companies?
Cruise Origin reveal
I don't think some of that argument above against GM is entirely fair. It's still doing well on EV sales, battery development, home energy stuff and is getting closer than many rivals to EV profitability. Plus, Super Cruise is massively underrated as ADAS tech. But the loss of the Cruise—or at least the idea of it—does sting somewhat if you're thinking really long-term.
So what are car companies supposed to be and how should they be viewed by customers and Wall Street alike? Let us know who you think will deliver the future, and how, in the comments.

"The $0-A-Month Fiat 500e Lease Deal Is Real, But There’s A Catch",https://www.motor1.com/news/744351/2024-fiat-500e-free-lease/,"All you have to pay are the taxes and fees, which total $62 a month over the 27-month lease.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Electric vehicles aren’t selling as well as automakers had hoped. Interest seems to be waning, and the growth rate is slowing, forcing dealers to offer some impressive incentives to move the product. The Larry H. Miller Chrysler Dodge Ram Fiat dealership in Aurora, Colorado, is one such outfit, offering the 2024 Fiat 500e for $0 down and $0 a month for 27 months.
While the advertisement says $0 a month, the lease isn’t completely free. The fine print spells out the true cost. Lessees will still need to pay taxes and fees totaling $1,693—$1,297.68 in estimated taxes and a $350 disposition fee. That comes out to just $62.69 a month, with state and federal incentives and rebates covering the actual upfront costs of the lease that go to the dealer. The feds have $7,500 to offer, while Colorado adds another $5,000 to the pot to bring costs down.
In a sea of new EVs, the 500e is odd. It has a 42-kilowatt-hour battery offering up to 149 miles of range on a single charge, with its front-mounted single motor providing propulsion. It’s also not cheap if you decide to purchase outright, with a starting price of $34,095 (including the $1,595 destination charge) before any incentives. The hatchback's small size and limited range make it perfect for urban driving, but also limits its audience.
Fiat has been struggling to sell the EV since its launch, most recently having to pause production at its Mirafiori, Italy, factory where it builds the 500e. The pause started at the end of last month, and the automaker appears to have extended the shutdown another two weeks until January 20, according to a new Reuters report.
The lease deal ends December 31, and it’s only available to Colorado residents. Lessees will have the option to purchase the EV for $17,388 once the lease expires.

U.S. EV Registrations Were Up In October Despite Tesla Being In The Red,https://insideevs.com/news/744553/ev-registrations-usa-october-2024/,"GM, Hyundai, Honda and Rivian had at least one model on the list of best-selling EVs. Tesla had three.",12/16/2024 8:23,"To be clear, Tesla is still the biggest player in the electric car market in the United States. That said, its grip seems to be slowly slipping.
In October, electric vehicle registrations in the United States went up 5% compared to the same month last year, thanks in no part to Tesla, which recorded a decline and nearly took down the whole industry with it if it weren’t for the likes of Hyundai, Chevrolet, Honda, Ford, Cadillac, Rivian and others.
In total, Americans bought 101,304 EVs in October, according to S&P Global Mobility. Out of those customers, fewer and fewer are going for Tesla models. In seven out of the first ten months of the year, the Elon Musk-led company saw its volume decline, and October is no different, with a 1.8% drop year-on-year.
More Good News From The EV Front
Without Tesla in the mix, EV registrations would have gone up 11% compared to last year, but–again–the overall volume would have been just 56,203. That’s because the Model Y and Model 3 are the country’s best-selling EVs by a long shot. In October alone, the Model Y recorded 21,787 registrations, down from the 25,220 units last year. Meanwhile, the Model 3 had 17,419 registrations, slightly up from last year’s 16,237. The controversial Cybertruck was also up there in the top 10 best-selling EVs in October, with 4,041 units registered.
However, Hyundai and General Motors saw the biggest gains, percentage-wise, as you can see in the table below.
The Chevy Equinox EV, Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq and Honda Prologue had huge jumps in the registration numbers because they were either not on sale in October of last year or deliveries were just starting to ramp up.
Meanwhile, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 managed to stay in the top three and recorded a 26% spike in registrations. A the other end of the top 10 list is the Rivian R1S, which noted 2,456 registrations, a 17% drop year-on-year.
When it comes to car brands, Tesla is the undisputed leader, followed by Chevrolet, Ford, Hyundai and Honda. Interestingly, Fisker, which went bankrupt earlier this year, had 110 registrations, more than Volkswagen, which had just 92. As a reminder, the German automaker’s volume seller, the ID.4 crossover, is under a stop-sale order due to a door handle recall.",Iulian Dnistran
The Tesla Cybertruck Might Have An Inventory Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/744506/tesla-cybertruck-foundation-series-inventory/,Limited-edition Foundation Series models are piling up in inventory across the country.,12/16/2024 4:05,"The limited-edition Tesla Cybertruck Foundation Series is piling in the automaker’s inventory. The Foundation Series was available until October in the United States for those who pre-ordered it and was the first version to be sold here after deliveries of the angular electric pickup began in November of last year.
It’s also the most expensive trim of the Cybertruck, costing either $99,990 for the dual-motor all-wheel drive or $119,990 for the tri-motor Cyberbeast. Technically, the Foundation Series isn’t any different from the run-of-the-mill Cybertruck, but the extra $20,000 on top of the base price brought customers extras like lifetime cellular connectivity, unrestricted access to the automaker’s so-called Full Self-Driving driving assistance system, a Powershare mobile connector, $2,500 in credits that could be used in Tesla’s online shop and a bunch of accessories.
Now though, there are dozens of these $100,000+ trucks sitting in Tesla’s inventory. Using the EV manufacturer’s website, we found brand-new Cybertruck Foundation Series models in several states including New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Colorado, Florida and Minnesota. There's also a report claiming Tesla is de-badging Foundation Series models to try and sell them as regular Cybertrucks in Canada.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Earlier this month, we reported that Tesla told some of its Cybertruck line workers to stay home, which led to speculation that the carmaker was having some demand issues with its flagship model.
Having said that, the top-tier units that ended up in inventory might collect dust for a while, seeing how the non-Foundation Series models cost $79,990 and $99,990 respectively. Sure, you won’t get FSD, lifetime premium connectivity and the Powershare mobile connector, but you get to keep $20,000 in the bank account, and that’s a lot of money whichever way you look at it. Plus, FSD can be used with a subscription that’s cancelable at any time–it costs $8,000 to buy it outright.
Then, there’s the issue of what was promised and what was delivered. When the Cybertruck debuted as a prototype back in 2019, Tesla touted a range of over 500 miles on a full charge, a towing capacity of over 14,000 pounds and a price between $39,900 and $69,900. None of these have translated into reality when deliveries officially started last November. The towing maximum capacity of the finished product is 11,000 lbs, the maximum range is 325 miles and the price is between $79,990 and $99,990. Granted, there’s supposedly a third, cheaper version on the way, with a single electric motor, but that hasn’t happened yet.",Iulian Dnistran
Mercedes-AMG Shows Its Electric Performance SUV For The First Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/744219/mercedes-amg-performance-suv-prototype-testing/,"The speedy SUV will have over 1,000 horsepower.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Mercedes-AMG is building two standalone performance vehicles: A high-powered SUV and a four-door coupe. The duo will use the brand's new AMG.EA architecture, and for better or worse, they'll both be electric. Today, we get our first official glimpse of the SUV in action, undergoing cold-weather testing in Sweden. And it looks… interesting.
Previewed earlier this year in a silhouette sketch, this is the first time anyone has seen the Mercedes-AMG SUV prototype on the road. Under all that camouflage the SUV has a four-door coupe-like design with a sharp front end and sleek bodywork. It will be similar in size to the current GLS, but best of all, it won't look anything like the current crop of Mercedes EQ products.
Details on the powertrain are still scarce, but we expect this SUV to be plenty powerful, and hopefully, equally as efficient. Mercedes has confirmed that the SUV will use axial flux motors and a new high-performance battery pack offering a 40-percent boost in energy density. That will yield an output of over 1,000 horsepower.
The current Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV is currently the most powerful AMG EV in the lineup. It has a 90.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 617 horsepower and 701 pound-feet of torque, which sends it to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds. This new SUV should be significantly brawnier.
Mercedes-AMG also released images of the four-door coupe undergoing testing in the snow, which we saw earlier this year. The electric sedan will replace the current AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, and use the same disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors as the SUV with an ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight.""
Expect to see both models in the metal sometime early in 2025.

What Lucid's Chief Engineer Thinks Of 'China's Apple Car',https://insideevs.com/news/744400/xiaomi-su7-lucid-chief-engineer/,Auto executives are obsessed with the Xiaomi SU7. Lucid's head engineer liked it too.,12/15/2024 12:00,"How the tables have turned. Historically, Chinese cars were nothing to write home about and Chinese car companies relied heavily on know-how shared with them by Western, Japanese and Korean partners. Now, China is the world’s biggest exporter of cars and the rest of the world is scrambling to understand how its homegrown car companies manage to make EVs that are so cheap, so good and so quick to market.
Because Chinese juggernauts like BYD and Geely are already storming into Europe and South America, and there’s good reason to believe the U.S. is next.
The Xiaomi SU7.
Automakers from Ford to Rivian have bought and benchmarked Chinese EVs to uncover their secrets—a common practice across the auto industry.
Lucid Motors has also been testing and tearing apart Chinese cars to better understand and learn from the competition, the startup’s chief engineer, Eric Bach, told InsideEVs in a recent interview. They have a lot of strengths, so it would be silly to ignore that, he said—especially as the firm ramps up new offerings like the Gravity SUV and upcoming affordable models.
“They've got core strengths in the digital realm,"" Bach said. ""They've got enormous speed capabilities and incredible work ethic that gives them a lot of product. And they've got government subsidies, obviously, that have created a huge competitive drive in China. And they're about to try to figure out how they go global.""
“So if you're not aware of that, that would be living in oblivion and not right,"" he said.
The company has a Nio and a Zeekr, and has ordered a Xiaomi SU7, David Lickfold, who leads Lucid’s vehicle dynamics team, told us this month. Bach said each Chinese brand has its strengths and weaknesses.
Generally speaking, though, Chinese automakers are crushing it in two key respects. One that may be surprising to some is craftsmanship.
The Xiaomi SU7.
“If you look at the maturity and the refinement of the exterior body or the interiors, you can find some of the competitors there showing a very high standard of execution,” Bach said. “And I think it is really important to acknowledge that the Chinese competition is not bad in terms of quality.”
The Nio EC6.
One model that exemplifies that is the SU7, he said. Consumer-technology company Xiaomi’s first-ever vehicle has proven extremely popular in China and has come to symbolize, in a sense, what China is capable of. The four-door Porsche Taycan lookalike—sometimes called “China’s Apple car”—recently got heaps of praise from Ford CEO Jim Farley.
China is also excelling in terms of digital features and infotainment software, Bach said, adding that Lucid is working to go that direction with the Gravity, its SUV that just started production. That vehicle has a sprawling curved display and a brand-new infotainment system that addresses some of the clunkiness of Lucid’s previous software.
The interior of a Ji Yue car.
“What [Chinese firms] have, maybe a little bit more, is more people that are programming at more hours per week, seemingly, and therefore the output is really, really high,” he said. “And we need to measure ourselves there and strive to be as quick and as imaginative.”
Ji Yue, a joint effort from the Chinese auto group Geely and tech firm Baidu that makes vehicles it calls ""robocars,"" impressed him with its digital experience, and in particular its navigation, voice command and advanced driver-assistance systems. (That firm has since run into trouble of its own, proving yet again that while Chinese automakers are impressive, they're not invincible—or above the same problems that can affect many EV newcomers.)
Where Chinese firms tend to come up short is in driving dynamics and performance, Bach said.
“I think the whole package comes together only at Lucid, and we were going to work really hard to keep it that way,” Bach said.
He has to. Because while the Chinese automakers are kept at bay in the U.S. by tariffs and regulations for now, that may not be the case forever—and Lucid could face its most intense, direct competition at a time when it's still trying to ramp up mass-production of its most important EVs.

California’s 2035 Gas Car Ban May Be Finalized Next Week: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/744407/ev-california-gas-car-sales-ban-2035/,The Biden administration may land a huge win for EVs next week as it's reportedly finalizing California's 2035 gas car sales ban.,12/15/2024 10:00,"California is the first state planning to phase out the sales of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, but that decision isn't federally approved yet. Now President Biden is racing to safeguard his climate legacy before leaving office next month, pushing forward multiple climate-focused agendas in the final days of his tenure. That includes greenlighting California's ambitious 2035 gas car ban as soon as next week, two people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post.
The transportation sector accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and passenger cars account for more than half of transportation emissions. Apart from planet-warming carbon dioxide, gas and diesel cars also emit hazardous byproducts like nitrous dioxide, carbon monoxide and soot that are directly linked to lung diseases, aggravated asthma and respiratory illnesses. The public health risks from gas car emissions have been widely researched and reported.
President-elect Donald Trump will likely attempt to revoke California's gas car ban, but he could run into legal obstacles. California used to have the most polluted air in the country historically, but things changed dramatically after the Clean Air Act of the 1970s that allowed the EPA to grant the state a waiver to set its own emissions standards to curb pollution. Now California is the biggest market in America for EVs and its efforts to move away from gas cars are recognized worldwide.
The Environmental Protection Agency already allows California to set stricter climate and emissions rules than the rest of the U.S. The zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have been adopted by 17 other states including Washington, Colorado and New York. Some of those states have also shown the intent to end gas cars sales next decade. (On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging California's authority to set its own emissions standards.)
The Biden administration is making a flurry of last-minute moves to lock in its climate plans before Trump takes over and threatens to reverse years of progress. Rivian just scored a massive $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to build its Georgia plant for next-gen models. The DOE approved a $1.5 billion loan for EVgo to roll out 7,500 new chargers across the country. And days after the presidential election, battery recycler Li-Cycle landed a $445 million loan to build a plant in Rochester, New York.

Could Plug & Charge Protocol Make EV Charging As Easy As One Two Three?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743799/plug-charge-protocol-ev-charging-easier-usa/,This could mean the end of pesky apps and tedious payment authentication systems.,12/25/2024 1:25,"EVs of both the four- and two-wheeled variety are gaining popularity all over the world. No matter where you go, it seems that more and more EVs are parked in malls, commercial centers, and office buildings. And indeed, the allure of sustainability, convenience, and practicality is what fools so many into spending way too much money on these appliances on wheels.Surely, when buying an EV, you’d think that charging should be much easier than filling up at the pumps. And while in theory it should be as easy as charging your smartphone, this couldn’t be any further from the truth.You see, there are layers upon layers of faff that can quickly turn your dream charging experience into a nightmare. You know, apps, subscriptions, payment links, and authorization steps? I ran into this craziness not too long ago when I drove for a buddy of mine in his EV. We decided to charge it up at a gas station while grabbing some lunch. How hard could it be? All I had to do was plug the damn thing in, right? Spoiler alert: I was wrong.
The charging station at our local Shell station made use of a third-party mobile app.
After plugging the thing into the charger, the screen told me that I had to download some obscure charging app I’d never heard of before. After that, I would then need to link said app to one of my P2P payment accounts, authorize it through email, and wait for an SMS verification code. By the time I found the App on the Apple App Store, our lunch was waiting for us. Not wanting my food to go cold, I decided that we had enough charge left to make it home, and decided not to deal with the hassle of using public charging infrastructure.
And I know that a lot of you share the same sentiments, too. Thankfully, however, the powers that be are taking notice, and things just might become a lot easier moving forward.
This is where the “Plug and Charge” protocol enters the picture. It’s a partnership between SAE Industry Technology Consortia, several manufacturers, and EV charging operators, and is backed by the Biden administration’s Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. A story by The Verge goes into great detail on how it all works, but in essence, the project’s goal is to make EV charging as easy as it should’ve been from the very start.
EV charging apps that require you to subscribe and link your payment information are a common pain point for EV owners.
With Plug and Charge, you can simply plug your EV into any public charger, and your vehicle will automatically communicate with the charger and bypass all the stuff you previously had to deal with. No more apps, no more logins, no more QR codes. Just charge, pay with your card, and ride away.
But of course, all this is much easier said than done. In order for Plug and Charge to be widely adopted, the collaboration of pretty much all automakers and electric motorcycle manufacturers is a must-have. And that’s because each and every Plug and Charge-equipped vehicle will need to have that line of code to communicate with chargers. So yeah, it isn’t magic, but rather, more tech to get around the hurdles brought to the table by, well, tech.
The article by The Verge reports that the project has cost around $1.5 million in development so far. But of course, should this thing be widely adopted, we can see the cost of this project growing substantially. Future funding will reportedly come from the companies that want to get involved. And at the end of the day, there’s a good chance that we as consumers will ultimately pay for the stuff. Manufacturers will market Plug and Charge as a feature of their vehicles, and this will likely reflect on the sticker price.
But hey, if they’re gonna milk us of our money, might as well do it in a way that’s as hassle-free as it can get, right?

The New DS N°8 Is France’s Most Luxurious EV,https://insideevs.com/news/744378/ds-no8-flagship-french-ev/,"There’s even a whiff of Cadillac about its design, which makes this something like a European Lyriq.",12/14/2024 14:00,"Posh Stellantis brand DS wants to be noticed with its new N°8, which sounds more like a new fragrance, not an electric coupe crossover. DS is a luxury spinoff of the Citroen brand, and the N°8 is its flagship product, which makes it France’s fanciest new car.
DS calls the N°8 its flagship even though it’s about 4.7 inches (12 centimeters) shorter in overall length compared to the DS9 sedan. Its maker says it’s an SUV, but it’s almost too low to even call it a crossover, with a total height of just over 62 inches (1.58 meters), which is almost the same as a Polestar 4.
However, even though it’s slightly smaller than the DS9, the N°8, which arrives in Europe around the middle of 2025, will be more expensive. Its starting price is just under €60,000 and a fully-loaded Etoile top trim with all the options will reach €85,000. Its direct rival, the Polestar 4, starts at €63,200, while a Volkswagen ID.7 costs around €54,000.
The base N°8 has a 74-kilowatt-hour battery good for 355 miles (572 kilometers) WLTP. The larger 97.2-kWh battery is rated for 466 miles (750 km) in the single-motor, front-wheel-drive configuration or 426 miles (686 km) in the dual-motor. Both batteries can charge at up to 200 kW, which is enough for a 20 to 80% charge in 27 minutes.
With a drag coefficient of just 0.24, the N°8 achieves a WLTP efficiency of 4.81 miles/kWh (12.9 kWh/100 km), which DS says is class-leading. One charge of the big battery should be able to power the car at 74.5 mph (120 km/h) for 310 miles (500 km) of constant highway driving.
Built on the STLA Medium 400-volt platform, the N°8 could have been equipped with mild and plug-in hybrid powertrains like the mechanically related Peugeot 3008 and 5008. However, only pure electric variants are offered. The base car features a single 227-horsepower electric motor that is dialed up to 242 hp with the long-range battery.
The most potent variant has a 345 hp dual-motor powertrain that temporarily goes up to 370 hp when the boost function is activated. This allows the N°8 to accelerate to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 5.4 seconds and up to 118 mph (190 km/h) flat out.
Technically, the DS N°8 has very similar numbers to the related Peugeot models, but it’s through its design that it stands out. Its light clusters are sharp, and they define the edges of its fascias, which is something Cadillac has also been doing with its design language for quite a while. Its greenhouse is low, and the fastback rear end is very aggressive, giving it quite a sporty look even by coupe crossover standards.
Inside, DS went for a bold steering wheel design that makes the driving experience feel very futuristic. It gets a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display complemented by a very wide 16-inch infotainment screen, and everything around them looks very extravagant—it’s quite an artsy-looking interior, and with available Alcantara or Nappa leather upholsteries and gold trim, it doesn’t look like anything else.
Since it’s French, you can expect some quirks, one of which being the interior door pulls that you find by reaching behind the speaker grilles. The faux grille in the front is also illuminated on the top variant, which makes an already bold design even more noticeable. Space in the trunk is abundant too, with an impressive maximum load volume of 21.9 cubic feet (620 liters) and easy access thanks to a powered hatch.
Other models it shares its platform with include the Opel Grandland and the Citroen C5 Aircross, both of which are also available with combustion powertrains. Stellantis is also working on a new Lancia Gamma built on the same underpinnings, which, like the DS N°8, will only come with electric power when it arrives in 2026.

The Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Way More Expensive Than The Gas Version,https://www.motor1.com/news/744052/escalade-iq-price/,"The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ starts at $129,900 including destination. That's over $40,000 than the cheapest gas-powered Escalade.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Cadillac has released pricing for the Escalade IQ, the all-electric version of its extremely popular luxury people-mover. The 2025 Escalade IQ will start at $129,900 with the $2,290 destination fee included, which is over $40,000 more than the cheapest gas-powered model.
Despite the similar names, the electric IQ and the gas-powered Escalade are fairly different SUVs. While the standard Escalade shares its squared-off bones and V-8 engine with its GM counterparts from Chevy and GMC, the IQ uses the platform found on trucks like the Hummer EV and Silverado EV. It's a foot longer than the gas Escalade and comes with its own body design that's far more sculpted and swept back, to improve aerodynamics.
The Escalade IQ will launch in four trims: Luxury 1, Sport 1, Luxury 2, and Sport 2. No matter which you choose, you'll get a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain powered by an Ultium battery pack with over 200.0 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity. Cadillac says this setup is good for 750 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque, with an estimated range of 460 miles. Pricing with destination for each trim can be seen below.
Aside from styling details like exterior trim and door handles, Luxury 1 and Sport 1 are essentially the same, equipment-wise. Both get standard features like a panoramic glass roof, 24-inch wheels, LED lighting, and rain-sensing wipers. Inside you'll find acres of synthetic leather, heated and ventilated seats, five-zone climate control, and a massive 55.0-inch display for the gauge cluster and infotainment screen.
Step up to Luxury 2 or Sport 2, and you get a 36-speaker sound system by AKG, massaging front seats, and different LED lighting. Importantly, going for either of the two higher trims adds a trailering package as standard, which comes with things like better blind-spot detection, a trailer brake controller, and a suite of apps and camera views to make the trailering experience easier. Opting for Sport or Luxury 2 also allows you to add the Executive Second Row Seating Package, which installs 14-way adjustable seats to the second row, as well as a center console with flip-out tables.
The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is expected to arrive at dealerships by the end of the year.

The Lucid Gravity Is Here. Now Comes The Hard Part.,https://insideevs.com/news/744393/lucid-gravity-production-eric-bach/,We talked to Lucid chief engineer Eric Bach about the start of Gravity production and what comes next.,12/14/2024 12:00,"Sleek, futuristic Lucid Gravity SUVs started trickling off the production line at the startup automaker's Arizona factory last week after years of development and some delays. Lucid Motors hopes its second-ever model will ignite sales like never before and pave the way for long-term financial health. But it has a hill to climb before any of that can happen.
Soon, Lucid will have to start churning out more vehicles more quickly than it’s ever had to before. That ramp-up process has proven fraught for new automakers, like Tesla. And that’s only half the battle. There’s not even a guarantee that buyers will line up in droves, given Lucid’s prior challenges with brand awareness.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
The launch of the Gravity is a make-or-break moment for Lucid, which has yet to turn a profit and has relied on billions in infusions from its majority shareholder, the Saudi Public Investment Fund. It’s the SUV that will drive revenue until Lucid’s true mainstream EV hits the road later this decade. The arrival of “Project Midsize,” a roughly $50,000 crossover, will mark Lucid’s Tesla Model Y moment—when it can hopefully hit the scale needed to reliably earn more than it spends.
Until then, the Gravity needs to be a hit. And that starts with ramping up production from a few units to thousands and then tens of thousands—no small feat.
“The key is to bring all the elements and areas together at the same time, at the right quality,” Eric Bach, Lucid’s chief engineer, told InsideEVs in a recent interview. “And that is what a ramp is about.”
Here are those elements, according to Bach. First off, you need a product that’s mature and durable and won’t result in endless warranty repairs once it starts going out to customers. You also need a supply base that’s dialed in and can ramp up production alongside the main assembly plant.
Lucid Gravity and Lucid Chief Engineer Eric Bach
The third leg of the stool is a competent factory and logistics system. Bach says ramping up production is stressful for any car company, but he believes Lucid is ready for it.
“The second ramp is always better than and easier than the first ramp because we've built more capabilities. I'm not afraid of the ramp at all,” he said. “Surely, there will be some hiccups and pain, but that's normal.”
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Lucid ran up against all manner of supply-chain and manufacturing issues when it started producing the Air sedan, its first and so far only model, at scale in 2022. But it’s far from alone there.
Famously, Tesla nearly went bankrupt during early Model 3 production in 2017 and 2018, a period Tesla CEO Elon Musk called ""production hell."" Even well-oiled automakers that have been doing this for a century have hit snags in manufacturing new electric models. General Motors spent months solving battery-production bottlenecks as it launched its new EVs like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq last year.
Lucid is focused on ramping up the Gravity with high quality, Bach said, echoing Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson’s comments on a recent earnings call. Although production has begun, Lucid hasn’t said when customer deliveries will start.
“I anticipate that we're going to be manufacturing-constrained next year in the buildup of Gravity,” he said in early November. “We need to get the quality right and take a judicious and very prudent approach to meeting customer expectations with the quality as we ramp up.”
As production gets underway, Bach’s team is hammering away on future over-the-air updates for the Gravity. And it’s working on homologating the SUV for global markets. It’s also been conducting testing with Tesla Superchargers, seeing as the Gravity will ship from the factory with Tesla’s previously exclusive charging port design. (It’s one of the first such models since the entire auto industry announced it would migrate to Tesla’s plug.)
Lucid hasn’t officially announced access to Tesla’s charging network for its owners, but Bach says that will happen in advance of the first Gravity deliveries.
The other big challenge facing Lucid here, and Rawlinson referred to it on that same earnings call, concerns demand and brand awareness. The startup sold just 6,001 Air sedans in 2023, and it’s projecting production of 9,000 vehicles this year. That’s a far cry from where it had expected to be by this point.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
In 2021, Lucid predicted that it would make 90,000 vehicles in 2024, including 41,000 Airs and 49,000 Gravity SUVs. That was based on the Gravity starting production in 2023, which it didn’t. So that delay accounts for about half the shortfall. On top of that, lots of people simply don’t know what a Lucid is or that they should even consider buying one.
“I’ve stated before that we’re not manufacturing-constrained,” Rawlinson said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “We’ve been market-constrained.”
Rawlinson said that Lucid’s brand awareness has been improving and that the Gravity should benefit from that momentum. Plus, the brand is planning an advertising blitz and more brick-and-mortar locations as part of the Gravity’s launch.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Bach is convinced that the Gravity itself will do wonders for the Lucid brand.
Sedans like the Air don't sell in large numbers anymore, which has held Lucid back. It’s a shame, in a way, because the Air is one of the best—if not the best—electric vehicles you can buy in America today. The Gravity, a seven-seat SUV, should unlock six times the addressable market of the Air and get Lucid on a lot more radars, Bach said. Then word-of-mouth can take over.
“I'm very positive that a better product is always the key starting point” for building a brand, he said.
On paper, the Gravity is indeed a mind-blowing vehicle. The Grand Touring model, the first to launch, will offer a whopping 450 miles of EPA-rated range, over 800 horsepower and over 900 pound-feet of torque. It’s pretty extraordinary in person as well, as I learned during a test drive in Malibu, California this month.
The thing looks like nothing else on the road, drives better than any hulking SUV should, offers a dazzling digital interface and has as much room inside as your average New York City apartment.
A teaser of Lucid's upcoming midsize crossover.
It has the potential to be a slam dunk. But it’s yet to be seen whether people will embrace that oddball, minivan-like shape. And then there’s the price; the Gravity Grand Touring starts at $94,900, more than tried-and-true gas-powered rivals like the BMW X7 or Volvo XC90. A $79,900 Touring model should arrive sometime next year.
There’s a lot riding on the Gravity. But Lucid is also steaming toward its next project, a smaller, more affordable family of vehicles expected to start production in 2026. About half of Bach’s team is working on that, he said.
“It never stops in my role,” Bach said.

"Tesla Cybertruck After 50,000 Miles: Owner Details Issues, Charging Costs",https://insideevs.com/news/744191/tesla-cybertruck-50000-miles-issues-costs/,"This is the highest-mileage Cybertruck in the world, supposedly.",12/14/2024 10:00,"The Tesla Cybertruck. It’s controversial because of its looks, higher-than-originally-advertised price, several recalls and unfortunate mishaps experienced by some owners. However, not all Cybertruck owners have had issues with their angular electric pickups.
Take, for instance, the truck detailed in the Teslatino video embedded below. With a little over 50,000 miles added on the clock since March, it’s supposedly the highest-mileage Cybertruck in the world, so it’s the perfect candidate for seeing what could go wrong with the controversial EV.
This particular Cybertruck had its fair share of travel, including a pretty epic trip to the Arctic Ocean earlier this year, so what could have gone wrong surely already went wrong. Well, sort of.
More Cybertruck Stories
Let’s start with the range estimate. This is an All-Wheel Drive Cybertruck which had an original range estimate of 318 miles on a full charge. Now, after 50,000 miles, the estimate never goes above 309 miles with a full battery, but bear in mind that the pickup has a roof rack and a roof tent, as well as off-road-oriented tires, all of which would affect the driving range in any EV. In other words, the range loss has been minimal given the circumstances.
In the energy efficiency department, the numbers look like this: an average efficiency of 513 Wh/mile or 1.95 miles/kWh. That’s not great but not terrible for a big truck with a roof rack and roof tent. Before these accessories were installed, the efficiency was a bit better at 471 Wh/mile or 2.12 miles/kWh.
So, how much did it cost to charge the Cybertruck for all this time? It depends. In total, the electric truck used 25,628 kWh of energy. Charging at home, where the owner’s electricity price is $0.11/kWh, comes to $2,819. If Tesla Superchargers are the only option, the total charging costs rise to $7,688, considering a price of $0.30/kWh. The owner said he predominantly used Superchargers from the very start, so the charging costs are pretty high, but the potential for lower costs exists in the form of home charging. By comparison, a gas-powered Ford F-150 would have needed roughly $7,000 in fuel, so take it as you may.
The only real issue with the truck was the motorized tonneau cover, which was misaligned a couple of times and some service visits were required. The recall for the accelerator pedal was also performed–the pedal cover was riveted at the bottom to prevent it from sliding out and blocking the accelerator in its wide-open position.
Here’s where things get a little more interesting, though. The rear motor of this all-wheel drive Cybertruck was swapped for a new unit–not because it was broken but because Tesla wanted to evaluate the potential damage inside it. That’s because this is allegedly the highest-mileage Cybertruck out there, so the automaker wanted to get some real-world information about the hardware.
Steer-by-wire also got a big thumbs-up from the owner. As a reminder, there’s no steering column on the Cybertruck–instead, the steering wheel sends digital signals to the steering motor.
That’s pretty much it. Granted, that rear motor swap is rather suspicious and a regular, non-influencer-type owner likely wouldn’t get the same treatment, but there was nothing wrong with the original unit to begin with. But what’s your take on this? Let us know in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran
The VW ID. Buzz Beats Its EPA Range Rating In The Real World,https://insideevs.com/news/744372/vw-id-buzz-real-world-range/,A new range test from Edmunds proves the ID. Buzz isn't as range-limited as we thought.,12/13/2024 15:00,"I wasn't too impressed by the Volkswagen ID. Buzz. I loved the design, but I couldn't quite figure out who it was for. Every minivan owner I know does a lot of road trips, and with a 231-mile EPA rating in mixed city/highway driving, the all-wheel-drive version didn't look up to the task. The rear-wheel-drive version was barely better, with 234 miles of range. But based on new testing from Edmunds, VW may be understating things.
Edmunds runs an efficiency loop that tries to re-create the EPA driving cycle. Part of why many cars ""underperform"" their stated ranges when tested solely on the highway is because the EPA range figure isn't a highway number. It's based on a mix of 55% city driving, 45% highway driving. But unlike gasoline cars, EVs are far more efficient in the city than they are in the highway.
EVs don't waste fuel idling, don't mind working from a stop and don't lose nearly as much energy braking, as they have regenerative braking systems that recapture their kinetic energy. But since electric motors are so efficient and have so few other efficiency losses, air resistance has a greater affect on range. Since resistance increases exponentially with speed, highway driving at 70 mph is a worst-case scenario for an EV, which would rather putter around town at 25 mph.
Automakers don't like it when customers feel short-changed by real-world range that doesn't live up to the advertised number. Many, therefore, try to make sure their numbers remain realistic on the highway, or when it's cold. The Germans are famous for this, which is why the Porsche Taycan always over-performs on our highway range tests. Now, we have our first bit of evidence that the ID. Buzz could be similar.
The all-wheel-drive version did 263 miles on Edmunds' test loop, beating its 231-mile range estimate by 32 miles. That's a good sign, though frankly I'm not sure it changes my contention that the ID. Buzz will be a poor fit for road trips. First, I expect that number to be considerably lower for a highway-only trip. Highway time is particularly punishing to big, blocky EVs like the Buzz, and so I'm doubtful that the Buzz can considerably beat its 231-mile range on the highway. It's also worth noting that this test was done unladen in Southern California, and therefore represents a best-case scenario.
Finally, you're not going to run your EV to 0%, and you're not likely to charge much beyond 80%. Which means your real world range between 26-minute stops—after an initial long stint, assuming you start with a full battery—will be between 161 and 185 miles, depending on if you go off the EPA or the Edmunds figure. That assumes warm weather and no significant payload. For $70,000 or more, I think the average minivan buyer is going to expect more.
That's ok. This isn't a product designed to replace the minivan. It's a cool halo product that'll sell on its design. For those willing to accept its range and price, there's at least good news. At least in mixed driving, the ID. Buzz can beat its range figure. To find out how it does on the highway, you'll have to wait for our 70-mph range test.

Chevrolet Bolt EV And EUV: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/744245/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-used-buying-guide/,"Nearly every used Chevrolet Bolt EV should meet the $25,000 threshold to be eligible for the used EV tax credit.",12/13/2024 13:00,"The Chevrolet Bolt EV’s superpower was value. Few would call the Bolt EV brilliant, sexy or premium-feeling. It was a solid EV, delivering a respectable 259 miles of EPA range starting for less than $30,000. Sales figures were perking up. But then GM pulled the plug on the model to make room for next-gen Ultium-powered EVs.
While you can no longer buy a new Chevrolet Bolt EV, there are plenty of used examples on the market with leases expiring and fleet sales. The Bolt EV was inexpensive to begin with. Used EV prices are tumbling. Scoring a used Bolt EV can get you a serviceable EV for a shockingly great deal.
Are you thinking of buying a used Chevrolet Bolt EV? Here are the key factors you need to consider.
Used Bolt EVs are affordable by EV or any other standard. Pre-refresh 2017-21 model Bolt EVs cost between $10,000 and $15,000. Post-refresh 2022-23 model year Bolt EVs cost between $15,000 and $20,000. Nearly every used Chevrolet Bolt EV should meet the $25,000 threshold to be eligible for the used EV tax credit.
Chevy Bolt Range Tests
The Bolt EV lineup remained relatively static. However, Chevy did make some significant changes during the model run. The Bolt EV upgraded from a 60 kWh to a larger 66 kWh battery pack for the 2020 model year, adding 21 miles in EPA range (from 238 to 259 miles). Chevy refreshed the Bolt EV for 2022, making aesthetic changes inside and out and adding a faster 48 amp Level 2 charging capability.
Chevy also added the Bolt EUV during the 2022 refresh. It shared the same electric powertrain and platform as the Bolt EV. The main difference was the Bolt EUV being 6.3 inches longer, permitting an extra 3.1 cubic feet of cabin space. Though, paradoxically, the larger Bolt EUV had less cargo space, 16.0 cubic feet vs. 16.6 cubic feet. The Bolt EUV also had GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving on its Premier trim.
More Bolt Recall Info
No one wants an EV that will catch on fire. And the Chevrolet Bolt EV suffered perhaps the most infamous fire-related recalls in the industry. GM recalled more than 140,000 Bolt EVs due to the risk of batteries spontaneously igniting. Ominous warnings instructed owners to park the vehicles outside and more than 50 feet from other vehicles.
The main concern for used Bolt EV buyers is how the recall was addressed. Many Bolt EVs, particularly those built between 2017 and 2019, had their battery packs replaced with new (and larger 66 kW) battery packs. Other Bolt EVs have received monitoring software instead of a complete battery replacement. GM also bought back many Bolt EVs from owners, now hitting the market again.
Prospective buyers should consult the vehicle’s maintenance record and CARFAX report to determine whether and how the Bolt EV’s battery recall was addressed.
One concern with Bolt EVs is their fast charging capability (or lack of it by modern standards). The Bolt EV packs older GM battery tech. It tops out at 55 kW and tapers down as the battery fills. At that rate, it can take the Bolt EV around 75 minutes to perform a full 10-80% charge — too long to make road trips or living without a home charger convenient.
The Bolt EV also lacks a heat pump found on more modern EVs. A heat pump reduces the energy required to heat the cabin to mitigate range loss in cold weather. Not having the heat pump leaves the Bolt EV susceptible to more than 30 percent range loss in cold weather.
Owners have not reported many consistent mechanical issues with Bolt EVs beyond the battery pack. However, buyers should ensure that all software updates and recalls have been addressed to avoid technical glitches.
Bolts With Bonus Range
All EVs suffer some battery degradation. Chevrolet warns of a potential 10-40% capacity drop for Bolt EVs during the 100,000-mile warranty period. Though anecdotally, Bolt EV owners have reported far less than that. YouTubers have noted degradation of around 5% at 100,000 miles and a little over 8% at 150,000 miles. And many of the oldest Bolt EVs on the road have effectively restarted the degradation clock with brand-new batteries.
Used Bolt EV buyers can do their due diligence by assassin the vehicle battery’s health before buying. Many dealers will already have performed tests through a service like Recurrent.
Typically, yes. Chevrolet provided a three-year or 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty on the Bolt EV. Bolt EVs came with an additional eight-year or 100,000-mile battery and powertrain warranty. Bolt EVs that have had their battery replaced as part of the recall received a new eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty.",Ty Duffy
Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,12/25/2024 1:25,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

How Nissan Blew It,https://insideevs.com/news/744333/nissan-hybrid-tesla-mercedes-cm/,"Nissan's U.S. strategy may be permanently behind the curve. Plus, the Trump Administration may end autonomous car crash reports like Tesla wants.",12/13/2024 11:30,"A decade ago, there were basically two names in the electric vehicle game: Tesla and Nissan.
Sure, several other car companies were dabbling in hybrids too, some of which would backtrack in later years. But it looked like a Silicon Valley upstart and a Japanese pioneer would be leading the way to a future that depended less on gasoline and more on electricity. Now, as Nissan enters 2025, its future feels less certain than ever. How did it go from leader in the EV and hybrid space to being so behind technologically that it's no longer offering the cars American buyers even want?
That kicks off this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and auto industry news. Make sure to also tune in to today's episode of the Plugged-In Podcast from InsideEVs as well. Also on deck today: Tesla wants the new White House to get rid of a crucial autonomous car safety metric, and Mercedes-Benz gives its vans an electric reset. Let's dig in.
Nissan E-Power Cutaway
The future is electric. Or at least, electrified. Sales of purely internal combustion vehicles have been in freefall globally since 2017, EV sales are the fastest-growing new car segment, and even if American buyers aren't ready to give up gasoline completely they are flocking to hybrids in droves. And here in the U.S., an automaker that was once a leader in both has nothing to offer those buyers.
Automotive News' Hans Griemel in Japan, one of the best reporters doing it, has a deep dive into Nissan's biggest crisis since its last one. Sales are way down, cash flow is ""dwindling,"" the stock price is tanking, the bond rating is almost junk and nothing looks to relieve pressure next year. According to that story, the appointment of a U.S. executive as the global Chief Financial Officer was not received well internally, due to the company's troubles in its most important market.
And then there's the electrified powertrain issue. Why not deploy the system used in cars like the E-Power Note, which sells well in other markets? Well:
All of it is far later than Nissan had indicated when it declared that hybrid technology would spread to America in high-end vehicles and that e-Power would form the backbone of electrification for a reborn Infiniti premium brand. The company even developed a more powerful system for overseas, including a version that bolts a high-tech turbocharged engine onto the series hybrid.
To hear headquarters tell it, North American executives dropped the ball.
“The U.S. team was not completely convinced that the electrification system was good for their business,” said one former executive involved with the decision-making. “They said U.S. consumers are not ready. It was a conservative approach.”
American product planners begged to differ. The setup didn’t provide enough charge for high-speed, long-distance highways, they said. Moreover, U.S. drivers were vexed by the decoupled feeling between the all-electric acceleration and the on-again, off-again engine generator.
Meanwhile, house-proud engineers in Japan resisted using a better-fit strong hybrid solution, such as the E-Tech setup developed by partner Renault that it could have borrowed.
So the answer instead was to do nothing, and now the Nissan Murano's big technical achievement is that it's getting rid of the V6 for a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Much like just about every other car company was doing a decade ago. It's not great.
Now, the question becomes this: could a thriving Chinese automaker acquire Nissan and use that as a sideways entry point into the U.S.? Possibly.
Nissan’s U.S. assembly plants and expansive dealer network make it a valuable prize for any Chinese automaker wanting instant access to the world’s most coveted market. The company’s manufacturing know-how is another handy asset.
“A Chinese OEM could be very interested in Nissan,” said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at the Itochu Research Institute’s Center for Industry Research. EV makers such as Nio, Xpeng or BYD could see Nissan as a good partner, as might Taiwan’s Foxconn, the iPhone maker trying to break into the auto business, Fukao said.
Griemel's story is worth a read in full. He reports that a plug-in hybrid Rogue is supposedly coming to the U.S. in late 2025 as well as an extended-range variant. But even those future offerings are years behind schedule.
It's important to note that the lack of electrification isn't the sole reason Nissan is in trouble here. But it's leading to a bigger problem of an uncompelling lineup of cars with a lacking strategy for how to urgently fix it.
Tesla Autopilot Crash
Tesla is betting the farm on fully autonomous cars and robotaxis. But its autonomous efforts so far have had more issues than just about any other company out there. When you look at the incidents involving Autopilot and Full Self-Driving over the years, it makes General Motors' Cruise (RIP) look like the very model of safety.
Now that CEO Elon Musk has a considerable amount of sway with the incoming Trump administration, the government may ""cripple the ability to [...] investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles with automated-driving systems."" Here's a scoop from Reuters:
Musk, the world's richest person, spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. Removing the crash-disclosure provision would particularly benefit Tesla, which has reported most of the crashes – more than 1,500 – to federal safety regulators under the program. Tesla has been targeted in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigations, including three stemming from the data.
The recommendation to kill the crash-reporting rule came from a transition team tasked with producing a 100-day strategy for automotive policy. The group called the measure a mandate for ""excessive"" data collection, the document seen by Reuters shows.
[...] In recent years, Tesla executives discussed with Musk the need to push for scrapping the crash-reporting requirement, according to one of the sources.
But because Biden officials expressed enthusiasm for the program, Tesla executives ultimately concluded that they would need a change in administration to get rid of the requirements, according to the source.
Tesla finds the rules unfair because it believes it reports better data than other automakers, which makes it look like Tesla is responsible for an outsized number of crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems, one of the sources said.
As I've said before, this is what Musk really wants. While the U.S. is long overdue for a federal framework to govern autonomous cars, one that involves less crash reporting overall seems less than ideal.
Mercedes EV Van Promo
On a more pleasant note: who doesn't love a good Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van? Those are some of the best out there. Now, as part of this EV 2.0 push (my term, not theirs) Mercedes is taking its van platform electric, the company announced today:
Starting in 2026, Mercedes-Benz Vans will introduce its newly developed, modular and scalable Van Electric Architecture (VAN.EA). With VAN.EA, Mercedes-Benz is shaping a completely new era of vans.
VAN.EA enables a clear distinction between privately positioned vans in the luxury segment and commercial vans in the premium segment. The future model portfolio of privately positioned vans will range from high-end family vehicles and exclusive VIP shuttles to spacious limousines tailored to the most discerning customers. By extending the top-tier of its product portfolio, Mercedes-Benz Vans is defining its unique own segment.
Cool. Looking forward to seeing it.
Nissan Epoch and Evo concepts
I try not to leave these with ""yes or no"" questions because the discussion is more lively when things are nuanced. But is acquiring Nissan's U.S. apparatus, branding and dealer network a good way in for BYD, Xpeng, Nio or the others?
I was at a Nissan-Kia dealer the other day getting some warranty work done on my EV6. The Nissan side, I'm sorry to say, has a kind of funereal vibe these days. That brand needs any help it can get. What if China saves the day?

America's Public Fast Chargers Have Doubled Since 2020,https://insideevs.com/news/744336/us-public-fast-chargers-doubled-since-2020/,"Yet, electric vehicle sales have grown much faster, leaving a lot to be desired on the charger front.",12/13/2024 10:00,"Back in 2021, the U.S. government earmarked $7.5 billion to build out a nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle fast-charging stations by 2030. The initiative is part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, falling under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. After a sluggish start, the program is now picking up momentum. There is now an increasing number of operational NEVI-backed stations and America’s charging network itself has doubled since the pandemic.
In addition to the Inflation Reduction Act, the NEVI program is one of the landmark legislations spearheaded by the Biden administration to steer the U.S. away from planet-warming gas cars towards EVs. It aims to develop a comprehensive network of chargers along the country's interstate highways at an average distance of 50 miles between every station. But the rollout of these chargers has been slow, tangled in a cobweb of permitting processes that vary wildly from states to districts and individual counties. There’s no national framework for charger permitting yet, which makes approvals painfully long.
EV skeptics have used the slow rollout for political gains by spreading misinformation and false claims that the Biden administration had blown the entire NEVI budget to construct just a handful of stations. In reality, the $7.5 billion is meant to fund the program’s buildout through 2030. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg even had to explain the basics of how the program works to Donald Trump Jr, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and their millions of followers on social media platform X.
Keeping the political hullabaloo aside, the rollout of chargers and the growth of EV sales has been largely disproportionate.
America’s charging network has doubled since 2020, growing from 96,190 publicly available Level 2 and DC fast-charging ports to over 200,000 today. Charging companies like Tesla, Electrify America, ChargePoint, and EVgo have helped build out this network. That’s a significant achievement, but it pales in comparison to EV sales growth. Sales of fully electric models more than quadrupled between 2020 and 2023, as per Edmunds.
With the NEVI-backed stations on the brink of mass deployment, they can help plug this massive gulf to a certain extent, assuming the incoming Trump administration doesn’t reverse the course.
The first NEVI-funded charging port went live last year. According to the Joint Office’s latest update, there are now 240 active ports across 14 states. There’s also a newly established NEVI dashboard to help netizens track the program’s progress. The dashboard reveals that every U.S. state has an approved plan to roll out chargers. So far, 36 states have awarded contracts to charging companies and 11 states have at least one operational NEVI-funded station. An additional 25,000 federally funded ports are in the works.
In another key update, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also recently issued a revision to the NEVI program. It now allows the Tesla connector, also known as the North American Charging Standard or the J3400 port, to be added to new or existing stations using NEVI funds. All major U.S. automakers have agreed to adopt the Tesla standard to open up access to thousands of Superchargers to their EV customers. States now may also use NEVI funds for Level 2, medium and heavy-duty and off-corridor EV chargers, as per the revision.
The future of EV charging could swing either way. The anti-subsidy sentiment is running high in the incoming Trump administration. Yet, Tesla is the third biggest beneficiary of NEVI funds, as per the newly released dashboard. Either way, road-tripping in an EV seems on track to be awesome and hassle-free—just how fast that will happen is an open question. Even if NEVI is rolled back, the charging network will likely keep growing, but probably at a slower pace.

"EV Motorcycle Maker Stark Future Just Changed The Game, Again",https://www.rideapart.com/news/743925/stark-future-2025-varg-ex-enduro-street-legal/,Who's ready to rock some single track well into the night?,12/25/2024 1:25,"I've been dying to get my hands on a Stark Varg, the all-electric dirt bike that has taken the world by storm, as everyone who's ridden one has come away with the same expletive-filled approvals. They usually involve saying, ""WTF, how is this so good?"" all while having the same manic smile plastered across their faces. 80 electric horsepower in a 250cc package tends to do that to you. Or so I'm told.
But the one motorcycle I've been waiting for Stark Future to build is a street-legal enduro bike. A motorcycle that I could take on some backcountry single track, go hunting or scouting, or use to engage in some off-road shenanigans. Something with a headlight for when the sun inevitably sinks below the horizon. Welp, my prayers have been answered. Say hello to the Stark Varg EX.
What's cool about the Varg EX is that, essentially, it's just a Varg with a number plate and lights. Nothing else has really been changed on the base dirt bike that everyone can't shut up about. It still claims 80 horsepower from its 7.2 kWh honeycomb magnesium battery. The one thing Stark did change, however, was to tune it to deliver 20 percent more range than the motocrosser, which translates to a max 6 hours of riding in certain modes.
Charging, however, only takes two hours via a 240v outlet. [So it's claimed, anyway.jj]
According to Stark, the Varg EX will be legal in multiple locales, stating, ""Riders can legally take it on thestreets in countries across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States. With A1 license compatibility and even car-license accessibility in Southern Europe, the VARG EX is set to broaden the appeal of Enduro riding.""
That's in large part due to the addition of a 4,000-lumen headlight, indicators and brake lights, as well as Stark's new ""Arkenstone"" display. This bit is Android-powered, and gives you navigation, turn-by-turn GPS trail recording, access to the bike's modes, engine braking, and regenerative brake settings, as well as ""community sharing options to upload and follow rider trails."" Neat.
Stark will also let customers personalize their Varg EXs with a host of add-ons, including titanium footpegs, bolts, and shafts to reduce weight, five tire options covering both tube and tubeless, Brembo brakes, and adjustable handlebars and foot pegs. Likewise, you can either get the base Varg EX with 60 horsepower or the Alpha with the full 80 horsepower. You know which one I'd get.
According to Stark's CEO and Founder Anton Wass, ""The VARG EX embodies everything we stand for at Stark Future. It’s designed to challenge and inspire the motorcycle industry to embrace sustainability by proving that electric technology can outperform gas in every aspect. With the VARG EX, we’re creating a bike that opens up new possibilities for riders, whether it’s conquering trails, commuting through the city, or simply riding anywhere, anytime.""
As for price, the Standard Varg EX will set you back $12,900. The Alpha version costs another $1,000 on top of that, for a total price of $13,900. Pre-orders are now open, and I'm having a real hard time not grabbing one myself. As I've spoken about in the past, the best place for electric motorcycles is the dirt, and this looks possibly perfect for what I do and love.
I really need to get on one ASAP.

Crazy Renault 5 Turbo 3E Is Headed To Production,https://insideevs.com/news/744326/renault-5-turbo-3e-production-specs-ev/,"The French are once again turning the craziness dial to 11. Meet the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a rear-wheel drive super hatch.",12/13/2024 8:19,"French automakers have a knack for making weird stuff that sometimes turns out to be extremely interesting. The Citroen SM rings a bell, and so does the original Renault 5. The latter went through several iterations, but probably the most recognizable of them all is the properly bonkers Renault 5 Turbo, a mid-engined rally-bred fire-breathing hatchback that was good for 120 miles per hour.
Well, the R5 Turbo is back, albeit for the electric age. This is the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a battery-powered super hatchback based on the recently revealed series-production city EV. But here’s the kicker, the Turbo 3E is also going into production, which gets our stamp of approval for serious craziness on Renault’s part.
It takes a lot of courage to bring something like this on the market, especially in Europe where things haven’t been going quite as well on the EV front as some manufacturers had hoped. But here comes Renault with a car that looks like it was envisioned by a 10-year-old after watching too much old-school rally footage.
More French Stuff
But enough of that. What’s under the skin of this thing? Quite a lot as it turns out, and its powertrain configuration is rather interesting. The Renault 5 Turbo 3E has two electric motors housed in the rear wheels. Combined, they put out over 500 horsepower, enough for a zero to 62 miles per hour sprint in just 3.5 seconds.
There’s no word on what battery will power this electric pocket rocket, or how much time will be needed to replenish said battery. But does it really matter? Look at it! It’s significantly wider than the standard Renault 5, with tires so skinny you’d be forgiven for thinking they could hold next to no air. There’s also a delightful nod to the original R5 Turbo and Turbo 2 of the 1980s in the form of side-mounted air vent lookalikes. In the originals, they fed fresh air to the combustion engine, and in the modern reinterpretation, one of those vents hides the charging port.
There are no photos of the interior, but we expect a familiar look as the tamer Renault 5, with dual screens and a touch of exuberance. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will have “performance worthy of a supercar or even a hypercar.” There’s no launch date yet, but we expect it to become a reality sometime in 2026. Bring it!",Iulian Dnistran
2025 Toyota BZ4X Gets A Huge Discount And 0% APR,https://insideevs.com/news/744283/2025-toyota-bz4x-discount-lease-pricing/,The new model year isn’t even on dealer lots yet and Toyota is already offering massive discounts for its sole EV in the U.S.,12/13/2024 3:06,"Toyota hasn’t said a thing about the upcoming 2025 bZ4X electric crossover. The car isn’t even on dealer lots yet–although it should get there by the end of this year–but the Japanese automaker is already offering a huge discount and very attractive leasing and financing options for the yet-to-be-released EV.
Let’s get that discount out of the way first. Through January 6, the 2025 Toyota bZ4X is available with a $10,000 lease cash discount in many regions, such as Denver, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and San Francisco. In other areas like the Gulf States and Cincinnati, the lease cash discount drops to $7,500, according to auto intelligence website CarsDirect, which is obviously less but still sizeable.
There’s more, though. When leasing, Toyota is offering rates equivalent to 0% (a money factor of 0.00001), which sure sounds like the automaker is keen on getting these EVs off dealer lots even before they get there from the factory.
More bZ4X Stuff
If financing is more your thing, there’s a good deal to be had, too. The 2025 bZ4X has 0% APR for a 72-month term and, on top of that, Toyota Financial is throwing in a $2,500 rebate that goes by the name TFS Finance Subvention cash. This is only available when financing, but it can be stacked with the 0% APR deal.
With all this being said, Toyota has some even more attractive offers for the outgoing 2024 bZ4X. In most regions, dealers are offering a $16,500 lease incentive and a money factor equivalent to 0%. In some cases, you could get a brand-new Toyota EV for just $219 per month for 36 months with a $2,999 down payment.
That’s a very hard offer to beat. However, wannabe shoppers might want to take into account the fact that the bZ4X isn’t exactly a record-breaking EV by any stretch of the imagination. With a maximum EPA-rated range of 252 miles and a maximum DC fast charging rate of 150 kilowatts, it's perfectly average in terms of electric performance. The current 2024 bZ4X starts at $44,465. It can be had with either a 201-horsepower front-wheel drive setup or a 214-hp dual-motor all-wheel drive configuration.",Iulian Dnistran
Bolt-On Solar Array Might Add Up To 20 Miles Of Range Per Day To Any EV,https://insideevs.com/news/744228/dartsolar-ev-solar-panels-range/,Who said you couldn’t build your own Aptera-like solar EV?,12/12/2024 15:00,"The name “Aptera” might ring a bell if you’ve been following the electric vehicle space for the past couple of years. The California-based startup has been working on a commercial solar EV or SEV for some time now. Its three-wheeled car is covered with solar panels that could, in theory, replenish the battery to offer up to 30 miles of driving range per day, for free.
That car, however, still seems like a distant dream, despite its makers claiming it will be ready for prime time “soon.” That said, it’s an interesting proposition, and now there’s another startup promising to harness the power of the sun to power an EV. Any EV, in this case.
Los Angeles-based DartSolar put together an expanding solar roof rack that could be fitted to any battery-powered car on the road, boosting its range while the owner is out shopping or chilling on the beach.
More Stuff Like This
The setup includes six low-profile photovoltaic panels, each with a rated power of 160 watts. This means the total power rating is 960 watts, but it’s up to the owner to choose how much juice they need. In its fully closed position, just two panels are exposed to the sun, which means a maximum of 320 W can be produced. This layout can reportedly be used all the time, including while driving.
If more power is needed, the other four panels are on sliders and the array can be expanded–two in the front and two in the back. The panels are fitted to a lightweight aluminum frame and the whole thing, including the roof bars, weighs 87 pounds.
So how does this invention send power to the car’s battery? Well, it’s simple: the solar array is connected to an external power pack–in one of the promo videos, it looks suspiciously like an EcoFlow Delta. Then, using a Level 1 or Level 2 EV charger, the owner can transfer power from the mobile battery to the car’s battery.
DartSolar says its setup works with any battery backup brand, which is not exactly surprising, seeing how DIY-ers around the world have been using similar setups for off-grid power use in remote locations for years.
The startup claims its system can add anywhere from 10 to 20 miles of range per day to any EV, seeing how it estimates a total energy output of around 5 kWh per day. The kit includes 3D printable parts and stainless steel telescopic tubes, and the expected lifetime of the whole thing is over 10 years.
The full price, including the backup battery, is $3,450. However, the startup has an early-bird promotion where potential customers can reserve the setup for a refundable fee of $99 and then pay another $2,950 when the product is ready to ship next year. DartSolar also says that some customers might be eligible for a 30% rebate in the form of tax credits.",Iulian Dnistran
"Why We Got Our Tesla Cybertruck Testers From Turo, Not Tesla",https://insideevs.com/news/744232/tesla-cybertruck-press-cars/,Tesla doesn't operate like other automakers. That makes testing one a bit more complicated.,12/12/2024 14:00,"There's a weird relationship at the heart of car reviews. Dealers largely won't let us drive cars for more than an hour, and that's not enough for a review. We'd love to buy every car we drive, but anyone suggesting that's possible doesn't really understand the economics of the modern digital media business. That means we have to turn to manufacturer-provided loaners, a compromise we aim to consistently note via our ""Full Disclosure"" section of the review. Yet that strategy doesn't work for Tesla.
The company does everything differently. While other automakers have press teams to handle inquiries from the media and, in most cases, provide loaners, Tesla merely provides a generic press@Tesla.com email address. It's effectively a wishing well. You throw questions and requests in, and nothing comes out.
The Breakthrough Awards
Tesla used to do this, back in the 2010s. Certain members of the current InsideEVs team got access to cars like the Model S and Model 3 when they were brand-new, writing for other outlets. But since CEO Elon Musk dissolved the Tesla press team, that's a no-go for us.
Now, Tesla does seem to loan some cars to so-called influencers, certain large magazines and outlets in Europe; its press team allowed us a new Model 3 for review in Europe because the company still interfaces with journalists over there. But here in the U.S., it's radio silence for all communications with the media: requests for comment, press releases, updates on new products and, yes, cars to test.
Some Tesla fans may see this as a victory over companies that are too buddy-buddy with the press. I get it. If you're trying to be ethical in this business, this sort of thing is a minefield and it's often abused.
The conflicts regarding reviewing a product you get for free are substantial, and I devote large parts of my efforts here to making sure we remain fair and free of outside influence on our reviews. I hope that comes through. I'm proud of the fact that our reviews are harsh when necessary, glowing when appropriate and always honest representations of what the author actually thinks. We don't pull punches.
The last thing I want to do is come off as entitled by complaining that a certain company won't give us free cars to test, either. But as an InsideEVs reader, you should know this makes it difficult to learn anything about what Tesla is doing. If we want to try out the latest software, or version of Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, or see what the updates to the Model 3 Highland and upcoming Model Y Juniper are like, we're basically out of luck. That can make the largest EV manufacturer in the world a kind of black box more often than we'd like.
Tesla's approach, unfortunately, guarantees that no one can do the sort of in-depth reporting that we do on other automakers. If we have a technical question about an engineering decision, a factual question about company policies or a genuine curiosity about something new, we can go kick rocks. Tesla isn't picking up the phone.
That makes it nigh-impossible to combat misinformation about the company—which abounds—as the one source that could refute a claim will never engage. When the company does communicate with the public, it does so through Elon Musk's X account, which often bears no resemblance to the truth (and unlike in the 2010s, has very little to do with Tesla these days.)
Lately, what we've seen is that the few people who are allowed to talk to Tesla executives or review their products with company demo cars, are sometimes the most fawning, hand-selected ""critics"" Tesla knows.
InsideEVs doesn't make that list. That means that if we want to experience the cars, we have to get them ourselves. Fair play.
The company doesn't owe us test cars; frankly, none do. But Tesla forces us to treat its products differently from others, so I wanted to lay out my thinking on the issue. If you think there's a better way, don't shy away from telling me. My email is below.
The first option is to borrow a car from readers. That is the fairest option on paper, as it doesn't require us to take discounts or rentals from other companies. But there's another moral tie-up there. I like our readers. I love the many, many readers who have volunteered to give us time in their cars, at no cost and with no strings attached. You are all so kind, and so well-intentioned. That there is the problem.
Because what happens, then, if I hate your car? If you're a Cybertruck owner who gives us a car out of the kindness of your heart, it'll be pretty hard for me to say the Cybertruck is a car you mostly buy for attention, even if I think that's true. Though there's no direct financial relationship there, there's an emotional one.
Plus, the liability of driving a private owner's car on company business is a nightmare. Most importantly, we can't really bother a reader's personal car for a week, and if we only drive for an hour it's hard to tell you anything you can't learn in a test drive.
We tested Cybertrucks all over the country for our Breakthrough Awards this year.
So there's one option if we want to spend a few days with a specific model. We use Turo. For the unfamiliar, Turo allows you to rent cars from private owners (and small businesses that use the site), and its key selling point is the ability to rent a specific car. So instead of getting a ""Chrysler Pacifica or similar"" that turns out to be a Mitsubishi Mirage, we can rent a specific Cyberbeast or Model S Plaid. And we pay for this ourselves.
It's the best solution, one that allows me to criticize a car freely while still providing something to the owner to make it worth their time. The one issue is that owners set the price, and for a hot new product like the Cybertruck loans can be expensive. When I drove one back in February, it was about $1,000 per day, plus extras. Then we have to insure it, and multiply that out by the six Breakthrough Awards judges we had and... oh my. This is why—full disclosure—we also work with Turo to get a discount in certain cases, particularly for bigger projects like this. Because of that, we also mention that we get the cars on Turo. I hope that's an acceptable compromise.
We're free to criticize the cars as needed, to drive them hundreds of miles and get real-world experience in them. The owner gets paid, Turo gets some publicity and Tesla doesn't have to lift a finger. I think it's a win-win-win for us, the readers and Turo, but I'm open to other suggestions.
And if you have any personal complaints about me, feel free to send them to press@Tesla.com. I'm sure someone will read them eventually.

"Callum’s New EV Is A $100,000+ Lightweight Buggy And Sports Car Mix",https://insideevs.com/news/744084/callum-skye-lightweight-buggy-ev/,The upcoming battery-powered 2+2 has been designed to appeal to Americans living on the West Coast.,12/12/2024 13:00,"Ian Callum is most known for his 20-year stint as Jaguar’s chief of design, which lasted until 2019. Now he’s set up his own eponymous company, and its first ground-up new model is a very unusual-looking cross between a buggy and a sports car, which promises to be exceptionally light for an electric vehicle.
The Callum Skye weighs just over 2,500 pounds (1,150 kilograms) even with a 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack (good for a claimed range of 170 miles) and two electric motors. The dual-motor setup, which makes the Skye all-wheel drive, doesn’t have an especially high output—just 247 hp and 221 pound-feet—but its low weight, good traction and instant power delivery will make accelerating off the line very quick.
Autocar talked to Ian Callum (whose last project at Jaguar was the stillborn electric XJ) about his latest creation, and the designer noted that it “is not just a pretty street car. It’s going to have real off-road capability. We’ve been working on this for two years so far, and now we're ready to start developing prototypes. So now is the right time to let the world see it, and we’ll be in production within two years.”
The Skye will be a very limited-series vehicle, with only between 50 and 250 examples being built annually starting in 2026. Its price is estimated to be between $100,000 and $140,000, and it’s billed as good on both tarmac and dirt roads.
It looks the way it does because, according to Ian Callum, it is “a West Coast of America-inspired car. It’s an off-road car, it’s a sand car, it’s a mud car, and I think the West Coast will be where a lot of our customers are based.” It will be available in two versions called ""The Dynamic"" and ""The Capable.""
The Dynamic
The Capable
The first will have a lower ground clearance and tires that maximize its performance on the tarmac and doors. The Capable will be something like an electric Ariel Nomad, with no doors, a taller ride height and off-road tires, which should make it far better at taking you over unpaved roads.
Inside, the Skye has a 2+2 layout, meaning it has two seats for the front occupants and two smaller rear seats for occasional use. It has a central infotainment screen (with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility) placed atop the dashboard, but facing the driver are traditional analog dials that not only show speed but also battery and drive unit temperature, power usage and state of charge. The steering wheel features a strap instead of a third prong, similar to the new Mini Cooper SE.

Global EV Survey: 92% Of EV Drivers Won’t Return To  Gas Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/744035/ev-owners-survey-global/,Switching to an electric car apparently ruins combustion cars for the vast majority of owners.,12/12/2024 12:00,"Electric vehicles are quiet, fast and packed with tech, and these advantages leave a lasting impression on owners. Very few of them, if any, would switch back to a combustion car after going electric, at least according to a new study published by the Global EV Alliance, which we also featured in today's Critical Materials.
It compiled responses from 23,000 EV owners in 18 countries (including the U.S., Brazil, and key European markets) and found that 92% of respondents said they would stick to electric cars for their next car purchase. Of those who would not choose a pure EV again, just 1% would go back to gasoline or diesel, and 4% would pick a plug-in hybrid. A study published this summer said only one in five Americans would choose an EV over a combustion car or a hybrid.
Petter Haugneland, Assistant Secretary General of The Norwegian EV Association, is quoted in the study as saying, “These results confirm that EV drivers are highly satisfied with their choice and that reports of declining EV popularity are greatly exaggerated.” Haugneland is referring to the many reports published this year pointing to falling EV popularity, even though the number of EVs bought in most markets actually went up in 2024.
The survey also polled respondents about why they chose an EV. The top three responses cited EVs’ lower operating costs, more climate-friendly running and lack of operating noise. It also found that 72% of those questioned said they charged at home, only 13% said they used a public fast charging network, and only 7% said they used public parking AC chargers.
When they were asked if, in their view, EVs presented any downsides, the most popular response was that they didn’t, followed by “the coverage of fast chargers is poor,” “charging is time-consuming” and “chargers are often out of function.”
EV drivers in Brazil strongly agreed with the idea that taking a long trip in an EV required more planning than in an ICE car, while respondents from Germany, Switzerland and Sweden didn’t see much of a difference. Regarding range anxiety, EV drivers in India and Brazil felt most affected, while German and Swiss drivers said it wasn’t an issue. Interestingly, Norwegian EV drivers reported above-average range anxiety.
Queuing while waiting to fast-charge is a real problem in areas where the expansion of charging networks couldn’t keep up with rising EV popularity. However, only 3% of respondents said they experienced this often, while 40% and 28% said it was rarely or never a problem for them. A more common problem is chargers occasionally not working, which was reported by 27% of those polled, and 5% said it happened often.
Over 50% also strongly agreed that you should simply be able to tap your card to pay for charging and not have to download a specific app for each charging network. However, that’s a goal that will require a lot more standardization of charging protocols, which will probably have to be imposed by a central authority since the charging providers would currently much rather just have you download their app.
Norway is still the world leader in EV adoption by quite a margin, and it’s the first country where EVs will soon outnumber combustion cars on the road. In November, EVs held a 94% share of the new car market in the wealthy northern European nation (up from 81% last year), and the best-selling cars this year were the Tesla Model Y, followed in second spot by the Model 3.
Plug-ins are also surging in popularity in China, where 1 million hybrids and plug-ins were delivered just in August alone, of which 582,813 were pure BEVs and 444,270 were PHEVs. China is also home to some of the world’s most prolific EV manufacturers, which are now trying to expand their sales success outside the People’s Republic into Europe and the Americas, although newly imposed import tariffs have affected their plans to a degree.
U.S. EV sales are also on an upward trend, as shown by the Q3 sales record, which marked a 5% improvement over Q2. EVs made up 8.9% of all new car sales in the previous quarter, up from 7.8% in Q3 2023, according to data presented by Cox Automotive. Another report says non-plug-in hybrids saw a significant sales boost and helped offset EVs’ slightly lower share of the entire light-duty vehicle market, which went down from 7.4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3, although the number of EVs sold is still higher than in 2023.
EV owners seem to really love their vehicles, even when they are not perfect. While this has been true for Tesla for many years, it now applies to Rivian more. The brand was ranked last for reliability in a recent Consumer Reports survey, but it came first overall in owner satisfaction. Here’s what someone who switched to a Rivian after almost four years of owning a Tesla thinks of the former.
Tesla used to be the satisfaction leader among EV manufacturers, but now it’s been dethroned by Rivian, surpassing established automakers with decades of car-building experience. Non-plug-in hybrids and combustion cars without electrification still provided owners with the highest satisfaction, according to another survey by Consumer Reports. However, EVs are still better than PHEVs in this respect.

Electric BMW M3 Shows Its Camouflaged Face For The First Time,https://insideevs.com/news/744184/bmw-electric-m3-teaser/,"It promises to deliver exhilarating performance thanks to a quad-motor layout when it arrives in 2027, but its looks may be polarizing.",12/12/2024 11:00,"BMW’s sporty Motorsport division is preparing to launch its first fully electric vehicle, and it’s begun building the hype even though the first one doesn’t arrive until 2027. After confirming the quad-motor layout of its upcoming electric M cars and how it wowed executives during an internal drive event, BMW is now teasing the first M EV, which will be based on the upcoming i3 sedan.
The i3 name will likely be repurposed to designate BMW’s new fully electric Neue Klasse (it already calls its G20 3 Series EV for China the i3), and iM3 or i3M seem like the most plausible names for the hot version. According to BMW Blog, there will be several variants of the i3M with power outputs ranging from 670 horsepower to double that in the most potent and hardcore quad-motor variant.
This suggests that base versions will be rear-wheel-drive. However, they may still have the same advanced torque vectoring characteristics thanks to a dual-motor configuration, and you should get it to misbehave pretty easily and turn its rear rubber into smoke. Even in the quad-motor variants, you will likely have a drift mode that sets the car up for maximum side slip. In today’s all-wheel-drive M cars, you can disconnect the front axle if you only want to slide around.
Bearing the internal codename ZA0, the electric M3 equivalent will be the first of its kind, but it will likely be followed by a two-door coupe (M4 equivalent) and an SUV to serve as an electric X3M. BMW’s latest teaser shots tell us a lot about what the M3 EV will look like, featuring design elements from Neue Klasse concepts and Motorsport design staples like blistered wheel arches and a deep chin spoiler.
From the side, you notice the camouflaged prototype doesn’t have the traditional M3 proportions, though. Its front section looks less like it’s hiding a big longitudinally mounted engine and more like that of a front-wheel-drive car. The front overhang looks pretty large too, and the overall design doesn’t appear as elegant as any current BMW sedan.
Hopefully, once the camo gets peeled off, what will be revealed is a sedan that’s pleasing to look at, but so far, its side profile isn’t convincing. It does have a sporty and purposeful stance with its flared-out fenders, but it seems like it wants to break with decades of design tradition, and this may backfire.
We also noticed the camouflaged prototype had what appear to be motorized, flush-fitting door handles, and the car is likely wearing its production body but with some placeholder parts like the front and rear light clusters. Even the stick-on fender flares appear to be the production parts since they resemble the ones on the current M3. Like on today’s M3, the upcoming EV doesn’t appear to have bespoke doors to go with the widened arches, an area of the car that has drawn much criticism.
The electric M3 was penned by Domagoj Dukec, who was at the helm of BMW’s design department and probably signed off on more controversial designs than Chris Bangle. Now, he’s been promoted to become the design director at Rolls-Royce, but his legacy will be felt until the end of the decade when Neue Klasse models will be receiving their mid-lifecycle refresh, and we’re not sure it’s a positive one.
Maybe once the camo comes off, it will reveal a much prettier shape than we’re seeing right now. While for many, the mere fact that BMW M is going electric might be shocking enough (pun intended), we’ve known about that for years. We're excited about that, but what raises some questions for us is the design. Let us know your thoughts on the camouflaged electric M3 and whether the whole Neue Klasse design language is successful.

Tesla Quietly Lobbied For Strict Emission Regulations As Musk Eyes Dismantling Others,https://insideevs.com/news/744114/tesla-uk-emissions-mandate-lobbied/,"Plus, the Cybertruck could be coming to China and Ferrari says it will always build its cars—even EVs—in Italy.",12/12/2024 10:00,"Tesla's CEO is no stranger to government regulation. He's talked ad nauseam about the sweeping fines his companies have received, the hoops Tesla's autonomy programs need to go through for approval, and the inefficiencies that he intends to correct alongside the incoming administration. And all that aside, Tesla still pushes for stricter regulation when it could mean enforcement in its favor.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Tesla's mission to convince the UK to tighten emission regulations, Cybertruck China launch looking like a possibility, and Ferrari's plans to always keep its production in Italy. Let's jump in.
Tesla has been quietly lobbying the U.K.'s Labor Party in an effort to further vehicle emission mandates on passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The finding comes from The Fast Charge newsletter, which uncovered a private letter penned by Tesla to the British government via freedom of information laws.
An analysis of the letter shows Tesla's EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) unit urging the British government to not just maintain course with its current directive for zero-emissions vehicles but to consider increasing mandates for both passenger cars and Heavy Goods Vehicles (semi-trucks) ""as soon as possible.""
The letter, which was authored in July, comes to light just after the UK government announced that it would loosen regulations on its ZEV mandate (in stark contrast to Tesla's ask) despite staying the course for a 2030 phase-out of combustion-only passenger cars. The government's decision came after pushback from major automakers revealed projected costs of around $7.6 billion related to the mandate in 2024 alone and a warning that the continued rapid momentum could threaten the UK's status as a manufacturing hub.
In its letter, Tesla says that the UK is ""falling behind"" at its current pace.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been a large proponent of setting fire to what he calls ""nonsense regulations."" In fact, it's a core promise that he's instilled in the formation of the new program he's tasked with co-leading in the U.S. under the incoming Trump administration, the Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk pledged to push for sweeping deregulation of ""government overreach,"" of which he has scrutinized the U.S. government for imposing on his vast array of companies—often for environmental-related infractions.
For example, SpaceX was recently fined $148,378 for wastewater violations, The Boring Company received a small fine in Texas for erecting an air-polluting facility without authorization, and Tesla settled with the EPA for $275,000 in 2022 over violations of the Clean Air Act in California as well as a $1.5 million settlement earlier this year to 25 separate counties regarding the mishandling of hazardous waste across the state. Separately, Tesla is repeatedly in hot water with the German government over pollution stemming from Giga Berlin, including claims that the factory has contaminated drinking water with ""six times more hazardous pollutants into the water system than its permits allow.""
And, of course, we can't ignore the timing here, either. Tesla seems to be gearing up for a potential European launch of the Tesla Semi—something it debuted seven years ago in the U.S. and has yet to reach large-scale production for commercial customers in its home market. Trucks were spotted at Tesla's German Gigafactory back in August, just a few months after Musk said that ""it makes sense to produce the Semi truck ... at Giga Berlin.""
Tesla also has a long punch card of taking advantage of government-sponsored funds to grow its business. From the same types of Department of Energy loans that it recently slammed rival Rivian for, to selling off regulatory tax credits for billions of dollars in revenue, and even building a version of its Model 3 with just 94 miles of range to qualify for a Canadian tax credit—Tesla is no stranger to utilizing government programs to its benefit. And if given the opportunity to push policy in its favor, why stop now?
Perspective is everything here. On the one hand, Tesla's push for more emissions moves progress towards a cleaner future with more sustainable cars, a mission that Tesla has claimed to support from the start. But on the other, it's impossible to disregard the hypocrisy of proposing more rules abroad in the name of progress while also promising to tear them down at home—regulation for thee, if it benefits me.
Tesla's polarizing Cybertruck could soon be hitting the streets of China. A new certification from the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology suggests that Tesla could be interested in launching its EV pickup in the Far East despite previously denouncing the possibility.
The automaker began shipping over a small army of Cybertrucks to China in January. However, Tesla wasn't bringing the trucks there to sell—instead, it was just a tease to show off its shiny metal marvel in a market where it couldn't be sold and had no plans of homologation. Well, until recently, that is. A new report from CNEV suggests that Tesla could be in the early phases of launching the product in one of its biggest markets.
Here's what CNEV has to say:
Tesla made a filing with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) to measure the energy consumption of the Cybertruck, and today it received an Automobile Energy Consumption Label.

[...]

Tesla is making improvements to the Cybertruck to comply with domestic market access requirements for pedestrian collision protection, local media outlet Yiche said in a report today, without mentioning further details.

It's worth noting that obtaining the Automobile Energy Consumption Label is just one of a number of compliance efforts car companies need to do for a model in China. The Cybertruck's receipt of the label may not necessarily mean that it will be introduced to China anytime soon.
This news comes as a bit of a surprise given how adamant Tesla has been that it wouldn't bring the Cybertruck to the Chinese market. Just days ago, Tesla's media team in China squashed the rumor. According to CNEV, which cites a report from another local publication, Tesla reportedly said it had ""no plans"" to launch the truck in China.
For argument's sake, there are a few good reasons why this could be the case. For starters, China classifies pickups as light trucks and imposes significantly more restrictions than passenger cars and SUVs. For example, light trucks are not permitted to exceed 62 MPH at highway speeds, often have restrictions on local roads, and may require tweaks to the body for safety regulations. And perhaps the biggest blow of all is that China's road laws require light trucks to be scrapped after 15 years of use.
CEO Elon Musk has also touched on the subject in the past. Musk mentioned that it would be ""very difficult"" to bring the truck into compliance with the overseas market:
Whether or not the Cybertruck actually makes it to China is anybody's guess right now. However, the fact that Tesla went through the trouble of obtaining an Automobile Energy Consumption Label is a step towards the possibility of seeing these shiny steel trapezoids hitting some more foreign streets. Plus, let's be real, Tesla could use an uplift from other countries to make the Cybertruck a success and keep its EV crown away from BYD. It seemingly blew through its backlog of U.S. reservation holders in just months which led to a quick launch in Canada and Mexico.
Automakers across the globe are worried about what the next era of Trump could mean for industry tariffs. The incoming administration has threatened to levy heavy duty fees on imports of all kinds—that is, of course, unless goods are built domestically. It's only natural that the uncertainty of tariffs and federal support for EVs has the auto industry shaking in their boots.
Well, that is, of course, unless you're Ferrari—then you know that your customers aren't sweating about a few thousand bucks for tariffs. In fact, the prancing horse is so certain that any potential tariffs won't impact its sales that it will continue to make all of its vehicles in Italy, including its first EV that's due to hit the streets next year.
That confirmation comes straight from the mouth of Ferrari's CEO, Benedetto Vigna. The former tech bro turned automotive head knows what the brand's customers want, and that's a made-in-Maranello Ferrari.
""We make cars in Maranello,"" said at Reuter's NEXT conference. ""We will sell cars in U.S., but we will make cars in Maranello.""
Ferrari sold 3,262 cars in the U.S. last year, which is about a quarter of the total number of vehicles it produced in 2023. Impressively, nearly half of those sales were hybrids—and future Ferrari buyers are undoubtedly ready to throw piles of cash at the brand's first EV (which, by the way, will receive a last-minute final price but is expected to cost upwards of $525,000).
And while Trump hasn't explicitly said that Europe would be subject to his tariff plans, European automakers fear that it will be just a matter of time, especially since Canada and Mexico could be subject to additional tariffs of up to 25% despite being the U.S.'s largest trading partners.
Ferrari, however, knows its customers and is largely unfazed by any such existential threat.
""Our order book is pretty strong,"" said Vigna. ""He decides what to do here, we will cope with those new rules... there will be tariffs for us, for everyone. It's good because when you have the realities changing around you, it's a way to foster more and more innovation.""
A Ferrari isn't a logical purchase—it's an emotional one. You buy one for status, you buy one for speed, you buy one because it's a Ferrari. It's not like you're cross-shopping an SF90 and a Toyota Camry. So what are a few thousand, or tens of thousands (or more), dollars when you're already spending Ferrari money?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
We talk about the future of the EV industry a lot. It's actually kind of insane how intertwined the entire field is with politics. You know, tariff-this, or EV-tax-credit-that—it's kind of exhausting what kind of mental gymnastics go into the entire automobile manufacturing business and it makes me wonder if a blanket ""all or none"" policy would be in the consumer's best interest.
Should the U.S. implement an all-or-none policy for tariffs? On the EV tax credit? On Both?
Now, I know there's a lot more than what's on the surface here. But let me know your thoughts and reasoning in the comments. I'll be reading.

These Yamaha E-Bike Designs For Carrying Kids Look Sketchy As Hell,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743642/yamaha-ebike-carrying-kids-sketchy/,But they make perfect sense in the proper environment.,12/25/2024 1:25,"All over the world, electric bicycles have changed the way people move. They’re simple, practical, and just easy to use to get around. And while wide, sprawling highways in the US are undoubtedly one of the biggest hurdles to their stateside success, in other parts of the world, electric bicycles have become very much integrated into the mainstream mobility network.
That's perhaps why these new e-bikes from Yamaha may seem totally sketchy to you. Both the PAS Baby and PAS Kiss e-bikes seem to put your youngster in a rather precarious position, exposing them to all sorts of dangers on the road. For starters, the PAS Baby, which has the child seat in the rear, keeps your toddler out of sight as you pilot the two-wheeler through the urban jungle. Surely, should an inattentive driver busy with their smartphone come hurtling towards you and your youngster, you’re in for a terrible time.
But the story isn’t much different with the PAS Kiss, either. Here, the child is strapped onto the bike’s front end, sort of like a handlebar ornament for the world to see. Should the rider need to come to a sudden stop, or should the brakes be engaged, one would think that a massive stoppie would ensure that would result in the kid being pinned underneath the bike and mommy thrown over the bars.
While all these gloomy scenarios are indeed within the realm of possibility, it’s important to remember that Yamaha’s e-bikes are designed, first and foremost, to be used in cities that already have the infrastructure for bicycle commuting.
Indeed, riding an e-bike with your toddler strapped to the front or back seems a lot safer if there aren’t any cars and trucks hurtling past you at 60 miles per hour. It also helps a whole lot if the environment in which you’re riding is clean, well-paved, and you know, actually designed for bikes. And all these are realities in many countries around the world, particularly in Europe and Asia, where governments are working towards making active mobility mainstream.
Then of course, there’s the topic of design. Yamaha has made sure that the PAS Baby and PAS Kiss are as safe as they could possibly be. To do this, the Japanese manufacturer incorporated a new compact frame which offers a lower center of gravity for improved stability. The PAS Baby’s child seat has also been redesigned. It’s called the Hug Seat Plus, and as its name suggests, it’s designed to keep your youngster tightly secured as the bike is in motion. It uses a race car-like seat complete with a harness and a halo to protect your kid at all costs.
Meanwhile, the PAS Kiss’ front-mounted seat is called the Cocoon Room Plus, and it’s essentially a shell that prevents kids from being crushed in the event of a frontal collision. The bike also gets a fairly long wheelbase for extra stability, as well as to prevent the whole over-the-bar incident I mentioned earlier.
So yeah, in the right context, Yamaha’s e-bikes for ferrying around your kids make perfect sense. But what do you think? Would you ditch your car for an electric bike for school drops and grocery runs if you could? It all seems like a fun and sustainable way forward, and one that could give your youngsters a love for the great outdoors in the process. Share your thoughts in the comments below.

The Toyota Urban Cruiser Returns To Europe As A Compact EV Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/744182/toyota-urban-cruiser-ev-specs-battery-official/,Remember the Scion xD? This is its successor in Europe.,12/12/2024 7:54,"Quick history lesson. Ill-fated car brand Scion sold the xD in North America for about six years before being discontinued in the second half of the 2010s. It was a subcompact crossover that was little more than a rebadged Toyota Ist. The Ist was also sold in Europe as the Urban Cruiser. All were powered by small gas engines and slotted below the Rav4.
Well, the Toyota Urban Cruiser nameplate is back, at least in Europe, after an eight-year hiatus. This time around, it’s once again a badge-engineering job, but in the form of an all-electric compact crossover that gets its design inspiration from last year’s Urban SUV concept.
More Toyota EVs
Measuring 168.7 inches long, 70.8 inches wide and 64.5 inches tall, and with a wheelbase of 106.3 inches, the all-new Toyota Urban Cruiser is larger than both the Yaris Cross and C-HR hybrids, but smaller than the bZ4X electric crossover. It’s also the same car underneath as the recently revealed Suzuki e Vitara–same platform, same battery, same electric motors and even the same interior. They’re also built in the same factory in India.
Let’s talk about the powertrain, then. Like its Suzuki counterpart, the Toyota Urban Cruiser is available with either a 49- or 61-kilowatt-hour battery. Both versions are of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) variety. The small pack is only offered in conjunction with a front-mounted electric motor making 142 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque. The large pack can be had with either the 142 hp front motor or a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for a total system output of 181 hp and 221 lb-ft.
Toyota didn’t say anything about the driving range. It did, however, mention that all versions of the Urban Cruiser come as standard with a heat pump and a manually operated pre-heating option for the battery, which should improve efficiency and lower charging times in cold climates. That said, we don’t know how much it would take to recharge the Urban Cruiser’s battery.
The front-wheel drive version gets a Snow Mode to help reduce wheel slip when driving on snow-covered roads, while the all-wheel drive version comes with Downhill Assist control and a Trail Mode which should detect when a wheel is spinning and send torque to the opposite wheel that has more traction.
Standard equipment also includes a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert and lane keep assist. On the dashboard, there’s a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen.
We’ll know more about the new Urban Cruiser after Toyota officially unveils it at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show in January.",Iulian Dnistran
Dust Moto's EV Hightail Dirt Bike Finally Looks Production-Ready,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743534/dust-moto-hightail-electric-ev-dirt-bike-production-debut/,Color us excited.,12/25/2024 1:25,"I got an early taste of Dust Moto's prototype electric dirt bike this spring. It was a very short test in my backyard. Further, I had the weight of the company's founders' eyes watching me as I took their one and only prototype for a quick rip.Suffice it to say, I didn't shred as hard as I would've liked.
But from what I felt beneath me, how the bike handled, the power delivery, the dynamics, the brakes, and everything else—albeit at slower speeds than I would've liked—it felt like it had real potential to become what the company envisions: a return to backyard fun.
Now, only a few short months later, Dust Moto is ready to debut the production-ready model and, like the prototype, it looks pretty solid, both in spec and design. It also has a new name: Hightail. Count me in the hype camp as it looks ready to hit your local motocross track, single track, or backyard with a vengeance.
The production Hightail dirt bike is powered by a 4.4-kWh swappable battery pack, delivering a claimed 42 horsepower and 44 pound-feet of torque. I highlight the swappable nature of the battery pack as I, and I don't think I'm alone in this, think that's a brilliant move by Dust Moto.
One of the chief concerns of anyone with EVs is, say it with me, range. But by having an easily swappable battery pack, especially one hooked up to a dirt bike that'll likely see more use on a moto track, means your fun won't stop just because your battery is depleted.
And if you have an extra battery with you when you do go to the track, or even in your backyard, you can swap it out for a fully-charged battery in less time than it would take you to fill up a gas tank.
Adding to the fun that I experienced is the fact that the Hightail weighs just 220 pounds. That's light as hell, especially for that amount of power. Then you add the fully adjustable front and rear suspension, with 10 inches of travel at the front, and 11 inches at the rear, along with chunky tires and beefy brakes—something I wish the Niu had—and you've got the recipe for a seriously good dirt bike. It'd make a helluva backcountry companion chasing elk or deer, too.
Dust Moto is currently accepting pre-orders for the Hightail, with customers only having to drop $100 to save their spot. As for the price, it'll be around $10,000 once it's finally time to pay the company, which isn't bad considering three things: The capability offered, it being an American-made bike, and also the fit and finish.
If you haven't guessed, I'm rooting for these folks, as I think the product has legs. Plus, who doesn't want to have fun in your backyard without pissing off the HOA?

Why GM CEO Mary Barra Is Our 2024 Person Of The Year,https://insideevs.com/news/743774/gm-mary-barra-award-breakthrough/,"It took lots of hard work, and un-learning old habits, to walk back GM’s disastrous electric 2023. Its CEO was up for the challenge.",12/11/2024 15:00,"The electric vehicle world is a graveyard of promises. A year ago, it seemed like General Motors might need to pick out a few burial plots of its own there.
The company’s EV battery production plan was way off schedule. Key new electric models kept getting delayed. One of its most important new cars ended the year under a stop-sale order after customers and journalists experienced disastrous software bugs.
Certainly, GM wasn’t alone in looking at the rise of Tesla and China’s electric automakers and saying, “How hard can this be?”, only to get crushed by reality. But adding the zero-emission dreams of America’s largest automaker—and one that once vowed to go all-electric by 2035—to that graveyard felt especially bleak.
Evidently, however, in her 10th year on the job, GM CEO Mary Barra is still up for a good challenge.
(Welcome to The Breakthrough Awards, InsideEVs' year-end awards program recognizing the EVs, people and technologies that are paving the way for our clean energy transition. Read about the awards and the other contenders below.)
The 2024 Breakthrough Awards
In less than 12 months, GM has turned things around to the point where it's a rare bright spot in the EV world, turning out new models all the time and offering some of the best—and only—truly affordable electric options on the market. Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday. That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs’ Breakthrough Awards’ Person Of The Year for 2024.
Business schools also teach stupid things, like how short-term shareholder returns aren’t your most important concern but your only one. Instead, we gave Barra this award for what GM has done for consumers, above all else: the Equinox EV in particular is the affordable, mainstream electric option that American families have been clamoring for. GM, in 2024, helped break the electric car out of the “high-end spaceship” paradigm it’s been stuck in way too long.
GM CEO Mary Barra with the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV
This transformation finally seems to be happening across the board. GM has other great affordable options like the Blazer EV and forthcoming reborn Bolt EUV (which we have little reason to think isn’t on track) and it also offers a growing range of electric trucks, high-end Cadillacs, even a three-row crossover. After 2023’s headaches, Barra certainly delivered on her promise to make 2024 a “year of execution.”
GM NACS
Yet even a good CEO can only do so much herself. It’d be a mistake to say that Barra alone rolled up her sleeves, dug in and cracked the code for fixing all those problems; she is not the person that Elon Musk pretends to be online.
That’s also why she deserves credit for acknowledging, and addressing, one of GM’s greatest historic weaknesses: its insularity. For the longest time, GM's prevailing attitude was that everything produced within the company was better than without, which is why its roster of engineers and managers is so dominated by cradle-to-grave lifers. But in a world defined by batteries and software, some fresh perspectives are necessary right now.
GM brought on Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, veterans of Apple and other companies, to advance its software efforts. It hired former Tesla execs Kurt Kelty and JP Clausen to oversee battery operations and global manufacturing, respectively. There are many more examples of high-profile hires from Tesla, Apple, Google, Lucid and others. That’s a big deal for the General, a company long known for refusing to look outside of itself for answers.
None of that is meant to diminish the considerable talent within GM, of course. It remains one of the greatest engineering firms in the world, and this turnaround could not have happened without its existing talent’s vast carmaking know-how. We’ve spoken to countless engineers and product planners who have worked at GM for decades and have not only been bitten by the electric “bug,” but are determined to win the future. But it takes a leader who can see how all of those components can work together and make sure it happens, and Barra has done that.
2024 Cadillac Lyriq
It continues to impress us that GM’s reversal came at the hands of a CEO who’s been on the job for almost 11 years and is a company “lifer” herself. Maybe it’s because she put herself through college working on a GM assembly line and rose through the ranks overseeing global manufacturing, personnel and product development; she's always been a person who can see how systems should fit together. Barra has been a beacon in countless other ways, including as one of the most powerful women leaders in the world. And besides things like sales and profits and new model launches, there's the stuff that deserves more attention than it gets, like the innovations with the hands-free driving aid Super Cruise or GM Energy’s efforts with charging and electric home power.
We looked closely at the competitive landscape for this award. The Hyundai Motor Group and its leadership came close, as its long-planned commitment to EVs is also paying dividends better than most, but ultimately we voted in favor of GM’s turnaround. By contrast, Ford, an early mover in the EV space and a true innovator at things like charging access, continues to be buried under battery and manufacturing costs. Volkswagen, with the foresight to build EVs in America, should be a leader in most markets but it’s buried in Europe’s carmaking crisis instead. Startups like Lucid and Rivian continue to be impressive in different ways and we see a future where their leadership could also win such an award, but their long-term stability is far from guaranteed. (As for Tesla, it’s unclear who’s even running that show anymore. It has drifted away from whatever stated mission it once had and it is debatable how much time its CEO has actually spent running it this year.)
Granted, GM is not out of the woods. The company's weaknesses and ongoing setbacks were weighed carefully by our judges. GM has still dialed back some of its EV plans and is, at the end of the day, still powered by gas truck profits. We also certainly do not agree with every decision made under Barra’s watch. GM, while profitable, has still done multiple rounds of layoffs this year and last. The decision to kill off the affordable Chevrolet Bolt, however temporary, was a strategic misfire that went against what most Americans are seeking from an EV. We do not see a path to victory in the public eye for the decision not to offer features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We also questioned GM’s ability to truly move at lightning speed like its competitors. Its inability to offer any plug-in hybrids—a technology it pioneered and then abandoned, and under Barra’s watch—until 2027 may be a troubling sign for its agility.

And as is the nature of a bet, not all of them pay off. As we saw just last week, GM still has its work cut out in China, let alone for the day when companies like BYD and Xpeng and Nio arrive on GM’s home turf. The evening before this story was published, Barra announced GM was throwing in the towel on its Cruise Robotaxi service. As ambitious as that bet was, only time will tell if GM got anything out of it besides more than $10 billion in losses.
That's the game these days. For an industry as entrenched as this one, nothing in this new future is promised and promises mean nothing.
But GM, under Barra especially, seems to have a collective talent for getting up and hitting back twice as hard when it’s knocked down. If it can keep that spirit up, we expect many more breakthroughs to come.

Battery Prices Down So Sharply That EVs Could Reach Gas Car Prices By 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/744038/ev-battery-prices-fall-faster-than-expected/,Lithium-ion battery prices witnessed a rapid fall in 2024. But something might stop this cascade.,12/11/2024 9:13,"“I don’t like electronic cars,” said a middle-aged woman sitting next to me on a recent flight out of New York. “They’re more expensive and don’t go too far,” she added before casually revealing that both her sons in Texas drive Teslas.
I just nodded. But this was one of the several dozen conversations I’ve had with strangers who shared their feelings about EVs. Educating the masses will be a massive undertaking for everyone involved in this transition. And while I didn’t engage with her, I’m hoping she’s reading InsideEVs this morning because lithium prices are falling faster than expected, as per a new report, speeding up the timeline for EVs to reach price parity with gas cars.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping the future of road transport. We’re also discussing loyalty among EV owners and the upcoming Stellantis-CATL battery plant in Spain.
EV battery prices are inextricably linked to costs of raw materials like lithium, a key ingredient in a cell, along with nickel, cobalt, graphite, manganese and more. While several studies have previously forecast battery prices to plummet over time, a new report from research firm BloombergNEF states that prices might be falling faster than expected, accelerating the industry’s quest for EVs to cost as much as gas cars on average by 2026.
This year, especially, was huge for the battery industry, with prices dropping 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour. Factors like lower component prices, cell overproduction and burgeoning chemistries like lithium-iron-phosphate drove the price drop this year, as per the report.
Here’s more from BloombergNEF:
The faster-than-expected decline signals that prices for electric vehicles could fall to similar levels to internal combustion engine vehicles as soon as in 2026, when average pricing is expected to fall below $100/kWh, the benchmark often referenced as the point of price parity.
“China alone is expected to produce enough battery cells to meet 92% of total global demand of 1.2 terawatt-hours for EV and stationary storage segments in 2024,” the report said. “This exerted downward pressure on battery prices. Smaller manufacturers are being challenged by their larger peers, pressured to lower cell prices and cut margins for market share.”Whether this downward trend continues over the next few years remains an open question.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (Section 45X) has massively subsidized battery costs. But its future now hangs in the balance. It’s uncertain if President-elect Donald Trump will also repeal 45X alongside the consumer tax credit (30D) of up to $7,500.
I’m inclined to think Trump won’t dismantle the entirety of the IRA. The law’s hundreds of billions in incentives have created thousands of well-paying American jobs and made North America the fastest-growing battery manufacturing region in the world.
Curtailing this ""white gold"" rush would be like giving away a lucrative inheritance just to appease a few friends and donors in oil and gas. It wouldn’t just stunt the auto industry’s growth, but also give China an even greater lead despite being so close to achieving price parity with polluting gas cars.
According to a study by the Global EV Alliance (GEVA), an auto industry non-profit, the vast majority of car buyers who go electric aren't looking back.
Of the respondents surveyed, 92% said they would repurchase fully electric models, 4% said they would opt for plug-in hybrids and about 1% said they would return to gas cars. Nearly all of them said they were satisfied being EV drivers, thanks largely to two leading factors: lower operating costs and climate concerns.
“This is a remarkably high number and the results conﬁrm that drivers love the EV experience and EVs are here to stay,” said Joel Levin, chair of GEVA and Director of Plug In America. Lower operating costs topped climate concerns as the leading reason to buy EVs, which signals that buyers have started appreciating the practicality and logic of EVs.
Even though 72% of the respondents had home charging access, they also cited public charger reliability, uptime and long charging times as the key disadvantages.
We’ve seen plenty of EV loyalty studies in the past. A recent McKinsey study said that 46% of U.S. and 29% of global EV buyers returned to gas cars. Another J.D. Power study also had similar results. A separate S&P Mobility study said that nearly 68% of Tesla buyers returned to the brand.
The GEVA survey had 23,254 respondents from 18 countries including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Norway, and India, leaving China out.
Cross-Atlantic conglomerate Stellantis, which has 14 brands under its umbrella including Jeep, Ram and Dodge, has teamed up with Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd to invest up to $4.3 billion for a lithium-ion battery plant in Zaragoza, Spain.
Stellantis is in crisis mode. Its sales are dropping and profits are shrinking due to increased competition from Chinese automakers in Europe, a challenging landscape for electrification altogether. Unions and dealer groups have also accused it of not keeping pace with the industry and recently its controversial CEO Carlos Tavares resigned ahead of schedule.
Now the automaker is turning to the world’s largest battery maker to catch up.
The 50-50 joint venture with CATL will focus on manufacturing lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. The JV is targeting the start of production by the end of 2026 and will supply packs for affordable crossovers and SUVs with an “intermediate range.”
However, reaching its maximum capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours comes with a big asterisk. Scaling up would depend on support from the Spanish government and the European Union, Stellantis said.
EV loyalty surveys are all over the place. No shocker there since adoption varies so much by region. But we want to hear from you: If you’ve gone electric, are you in for life? Or would you consider switching back to gas or hybrid? Drop your thoughts in the comments. We do read them quite seriously.

"Lightship’s Self-Propelled Electric RV Trailer Is Going Into Production, And It Ain’t Cheap",https://insideevs.com/news/743731/lightship-ae1-cosmos-production-official/,"Originally known as the Lightship L1, the trailer has its own powertrain and battery to preserve the tow vehicle’s range.",12/11/2024 9:00,"Towing big trailers is still the Achilles' heel of modern electric vehicles. Even though battery-powered trucks like the Rivian R1T, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Tesla Cybertruck can happily tow 10,000 pounds or more, their driving range goes down the drain the moment you attach anything on that trailer hitch.
For work, this might not be a huge annoyance, but if you’re the kind of person who loves to tow an RV across the country, you’re in for the charging experience of a lifetime. As in, you’ll have to stop every 150 miles or so to replenish the truck’s battery for the next leg of the journey.
Luckily, there’s a potential solution for that, in the form of a self-propelled RV–but it’ll cost you. One such RV is the Lightship AE.1, an American-made camper trailer that’s finally entering production next year after being unveiled in 2023. You might recall it after its initial name, the Lightship L1, but for some reason, the company decided to change it to AE.1.
More Electric Camping Trailers And RVs
Whatever the name, you should know that the luxury RV has its own electric powertrain and an embedded battery that can store up to 77 kilowatt-hours of energy. This combo means the tow vehicle–electric or otherwise–won’t have to put so much effort into pulling the trailer because the electric motor of the RV will assist with the movement, thus increasing the efficiency of the vehicle at the front.
Furthermore, the Lightship AE.1 was designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, which helps on long trips at highway speeds. When on the road, the trailer is about the same height as a Ford F-150 Lightning, but when you get to the campsite, the roof rises to expand the interior and allow campers to stand and sit comfortably.
Speaking of comfort, the first 50 units to roll off the assembly line are called AE.1 Cosmos. The limited-edition model has a full-solar roof, can sleep four adults and offers amenities like an automotive-grade HVAC system, a fully outfitted bathroom and a Galley Kitchen equipped with a dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, convection oven and induction cooktop.
“With the limited-edition Lightship AE.1 Cosmos, we’re delivering a dream travel experience for sustainable travelers, tech lovers and EV enthusiasts,” said Ben Parker, Lightship Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. “Our mission is to bring RVs into the electric age with the AE.1. The Cosmos Edition is the first premium realization, and we have other trims to fit travelers’ needs coming quickly down the road.”
The limited-edition Lightship AE.1 Cosmos retails for $250,000, and the first deliveries are slated for the summer of next year. Three additional–and more affordable–versions called the Atmos, Panos and Terros will follow.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Toyota bZ3X EV SUV Starts Under $14,000–But You Can’t Have One",https://insideevs.com/news/744039/toyota-bz3x-ev-suv-price/,"Roughly the same size as a Toyota Rav4, the electric crossover is powered by an LFP battery and has some bold range claims.",12/11/2024 8:17,"Toyota has just one all-electric car on sale in the United States, the bZ4X crossover. It starts at $44,465, it has 252 miles of range on a full battery and it’s not particularly impressive in the charging speed department. In other words, it’s not exactly competitive, seeing how Tesla, Hyundai and others have electric crossovers that offer more of everything for a similar price.
But Toyota knows how to build cheaper and more appealing EVs–they’re just not available in the United States. Enter the new Toyota bZ3X, an electric crossover developed with China’s GAC specifically for the Chinese market, which is notorious for breaking traditional automakers’ hopes and dreams. In other words, the world's largest car market is ruthless, so brands need to bring their A-game.
Pre-orders for the bZ3X, which is roughly the same size as a Toyota Rav4, are now live in China, and the starting price is truly impressive: 100,000 yuan or roughly $13,800. That price tag increases up to 200,000 yuan ($27,500) as you move up the trim ladder, but that’s still $17,000 less than the entry-level bZ4X in the U.S.
We Heard You Like Cheap EVs
Granted, China is well-known for subsidizing EV production in any way it can, but those are still very impressive numbers. And things only get better once we factor in the specs. Three versions will be available: 430 Air+, 520 Pro+ and 620 Max. The entry-level trim gets a single electric motor making 150 kilowatts (201 horsepower) and a 50-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack that’s good for 267 miles (430 kilometers) on a full charge on the rather lenient CLTC procedure.
Toyota hasn’t revealed the specs for the remaining trim levels, but logic dictates that the 520+ Pro will have 323 miles (520 km) of range, while the 620 Max will offer 385 miles (620 km) of range. Recharging from 30% to 80% state of charge takes 24 minutes, as per GAC-Toyota.
The EV comes with an Nvidia-powered advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that gets info from 27 sensors, including 11 high-definition cameras, 12 ultrasonic radars, 3 millimeter-wave radars and a lidar. These enable features like speed limit assist, traffic light assist, remote parking and blind spot monitoring, according to CarNewsChina.
Inside, the bZ3X has a two-spoke steering wheel, ambient lighting and an 11-speaker Yamaha audio system. An 8.8-inch screen sits in front of the steering wheel and acts as the digital instrument cluster, while a 14.6-inch floating touchscreen serves the infotainment.
Chinese buyers can pre-order the Toyota bZ3X for the equivalent of $275. This gets them priority delivery when shipments begin in March next year.",Iulian Dnistran
Costco Is Adding More EV Fast Chargers At Its Stores,https://insideevs.com/news/743982/costco-adding-more-ev-fast-chargers/,The wholesale giant partnered with Electrify America to install DC chargers capable of up to 350 kW in three states.,12/11/2024 3:48,"Costco, America’s largest wholesaler and the third-largest retailer in the world, is ramping up its efforts to install fast chargers for electric vehicles at its stores in the United States. The retail giant has partnered with Electrify America to open five ultra-fast EV charging stations in three states.
The move comes after a cautious entry into the DC fast-charging world earlier this year for Costco, a company that’s widely known for its gas discounts. The retailer said last year that it has no plans to add EV chargers at its stores, but then stated in its 2023 climate action plan that it wants to install fast chargers at 20 undisclosed locations during an undisclosed period.
The five stations are co-branded by Costco and Electrify America. They offer between 6 and 14 stalls, and all are capable of delivering up to 350 kilowatts of power.
More Stuff Like This
The stations are integrated into Electrify America’s network, so customers can use the operator’s smartphone app to find stalls and pay for charging sessions, but the pricing is set by Costco, which also owns the stations.
The largest station from this collaboration has 14 DC fast chargers and is located at 4107 Sierra College Boulevard in Loomis, California. Two stations with 10 stalls are up and running in Pleasanton and Sacramento in California. Two other stations, with six stalls each, are operational in Clermont, Florida, and Denver, Colorado. The latter was quietly inaugurated last year.
Costco's new DC fast chargers are co-branded by Electrify America.
Besides these Electrify America stalls, Costco also partnered with Seattle-based Electric Era to install 200 kW stalls at its warehouse store in Ridgefield, Washington. The dispensers are branded Costco and have built-in batteries to keep the lights on when grid power goes out and to make the best of off-peak electricity rates.
The DC fast chargers found at Costco parking lots have CCS1 connectors, so Tesla drivers will need an adapter to use them. At the Electric Era stalls in Ridgefield, California, it costs 29 cents/kWh to charge, according to PlugShare. At the Electrify America-installed stalls, the price is 46 cents/kWh.",Iulian Dnistran
Cruise Robotaxi Service Is Dead As GM Pivots,https://insideevs.com/news/743947/gm-pulls-funding-cruise-robotaxi/,"""A Robotaxi business is not General Motors' core business,"" said CEO Mary Barra.",12/10/2024 17:28,"After a staggering $10 billion investment, General Motors is officially hitting the brakes on Cruise.
The automaker's once-ambitious foray into the world of robotaxis has caused the automaker more than a few headaches—both financial and legal. And at a time when GM is more mindful of costs than ever, Cruise will be one of the first branches CEO Mary Barra lops off to save the tree.
""The amount of money to deploy a robotaxi business and then to maintain that business and grow it, it's quite a bit of capital,"" said CEO Mary Barra during a media call on Tuesday. ""A robotaxi business is not General Motors' core business.""
Instead, Barra said, GM's automated driving efforts will focus on the consumer side of things, meaning increasingly automated and driverless cars instead of a robotaxi service.
David Richardson, GM's Senior Vice President of Software and Services, acknowledged that pursuing one path to autonomy is ""way more efficient"" and that augmenting Super Cruise with the technologies developed by Cruise will drive more returns than operating a robotaxi network.
Cruise's plans to roll out robotaxis nationwide might be over, but its technology and talent won't go to waste. GM says that it plans to roll Cruise's advances into what it's calling ""Personal Autonomy""—the kind that you or I have access to in our personal vehicles. Think of a more advanced version of GM's Super Cruise with the final technical destination being Level 3 and Level 4 autonomy.
Sure, that's not the same thing as hopping in the back seat of a Cruise-branded Chevy Bolt and being chauffeured completely autonomously, but GM says that's not what folks want all of the time, anyway: they want to drive themselves.
""We know people everywhere love to drive their own vehicles, but not in every situation,"" Barra said. She later continued: ""The opportunity to deliver these benefits to our customers that they'll use every day is very exciting for us, and that is our core business,"" said Barra.
GM openly cited increased competition as a hurdle in the robotaxi market. And while GM is right—there are a lot of players on the court, like Waymo, Zoox, and allegedly, Tesla soon—Cruise was one of the big ones, recent problems aside.
Cruise Origin in SF's Castro District
But those problems did not help Cruise's chances in the marketplace. The service shut down in October 2023 after a series of collisions with pedestrians, which led to the California DMV's suspension of its autonomous taxi operations. Its founding CEO Kyle Vogt resigned soon afterward (and later directed a good deal of ire at GM for how it handles new technology) and the future of the Cruise Origin shuttle was left more in doubt than ever. While Cruise resumed operations with a small fleet of human-driven vehicles in a few cities, it never quite recovered from these setbacks. And then GM, facing a $5 billion loss from restructuring its China operations, decided to save money by pulling the plug entirely.
It’s a hard truth to swallow: the race to autonomy is expensive. It’s also proving to be harder than the brand expected For GM to abandon Cruise now could be a sign that GM simply doesn’t see Level 5 autonomy as achievable in the near future (especially since Barra specifically referenced Levels 3 and 4 as the tech it plans to port over from Cruise), or that the brand is simply unwilling to sink even more money into its autonomous driving efforts when billions could be spent better elsewhere.
Barra says that GM and Cruise haven’t worked out the details just yet. GM does intend to purchase the remaining shares of Cruise which would enable it to roll the AV company’s tech and talent into its internal ecosystem, however, that’s still a big to be decided. The automaker plans to work with Cruise’s board to see what a transition plan could look like moving forward and expects to share more with the public later this year.
Maybe the better question to ponder is whether or not the robotaxi narrative was overhyped from the get-go. Sure, Cruise’s innovations will live on in GM’s future products—in the same sense as brands developing racing tech for Formula One and then technically stuffing it into its road cars. But this major retreat is a true taste of reality for the AV industry.
And if GM needs more financial security, maybe grounding its autonomy dreams is the right path to take.

From Tesla To Rivian: Here's What One Owner Thinks After Switching,https://insideevs.com/news/743908/tesla-to-rivian-switch-owner/,"Going from a Tesla to a Rivian, you have a lot of new stuff to play with, but there are some features you may still miss.",12/10/2024 14:00,"Tesla makes excellent electric vehicles that many owners are so enamored with that switching to a different brand seems inconceivable. But this former Model S owner who bought a brand new 2025 Rivian R1S couldn’t be happier with the switch, although there are some Tesla features that he still misses.
Shane Burgman owned his Model S with a yoke for almost four years, and he wanted to replace it with something more practical. The logical step would have been to get a Model X, which is essentially a taller and roomier version of the Model S, but other electric vehicles might fit the bill better.
Readapting to a traditional round steering wheel with physical buttons and stalks behind the wheel shouldn’t be a problem. Still, Shane mentions that he misses the obstruction-free view of the instrument cluster that the yoke provided. However, the tried and true layout will likely grow on him after using it for a while, and it may change how he sees the Tesla yoke with its multitude of touch-sensitive buttons and no indicator or transmission stalks (which are available aftermarket).
Other features he misses from his Tesla include its excellent video streaming capabilities (with in-built YouTube, Netflix and other platforms). This isn’t a feature that is yet available in the Rivian.
Another thing he isn't happy with is the doors, which feel heavy and solid, but he says are harder than you think to close, and they could have used a soft-close feature given the price point of the R1S. The audio quality is another point of criticism, even though the R1S in the video features the upgraded audio system.
Teslas are known to have pretty good standard sound systems and the one in the Rivian is known to be somewhat mediocre, so the difference in sound quality is likely there. However, the thing Shane says he will miss most is Autopilot, which worked on virtually all roads and took some of the strain out of driving. In the Rivian, he can’t enable adaptive cruise control with lane centering on the same roads where he had it on in the Tesla.

Tesla Model 3: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/743728/used-tesla-model-3-buying-guide/,There are a lot of used Model 3s out there. Here's what you need to know before buying one.,12/10/2024 13:00,"Time flies in a rapidly evolving automotive landscape. Tesla has gone from a quirky upstart to an established manufacturer. Its entry-level car, the Model 3 sedan has been in production for more than seven years. That means there are a lot of used Model 3s out there.
Used Model 3s, not so long ago, were prohibitively expensive. However, Tesla’s new car production has risen to meet demand. Thousands of used Model 3s have been hitting the market coming off lease and Hertz fleet sales. The prices of used Model 3s are plummeting. And with Tesla’s industry-leading tech and potential used EV tax credits available, a used Model 3 could be one of the best deals on the EV market.
If you are considering buying a used Tesla Model 3, here are some important questions to consider.
Tesla Model 3 (Highland)
Buying a used Model 3 suddenly became a lot more affordable. According to iSeeCars data, the average used Tesla price has fallen to $29,045, a 22.6% year-over-year drop. Anecdotally, Tesla’s Model 3s coming off leases range between $25,000-$30,000. Hertz ex-rental Tesla Model 3s range between $20,000 and $25,000; some high-mileage ones may dip below $20,000.
One major price escalator is Full Self-Driving. An FSD-equipped used Model 3 will likely be in the $30,000s. Low mileage examples may exceed $40,000.
Tesla Model 3
Most manufacturers maintain a static trim lineup. Tesla changes and reuses terminology on a whim and does not adhere to the model year cycle other brands use. It can be confusing to tell which Model 3 trim you are buying. And that could be the difference between a Model 3 with 220 miles range or one with 360 miles and 5.8-second 0 to 60 mph acceleration vs. sub-3.0-second.
Broadly, Tesla typically has offered small-battery, RWD base Model 3, RWD and AWD versions of large-battery, long-range Model 3, and AWD performance models. Double-checking the VIN is always a good idea, especially if you buy a used Model 3 from a third party. You want to ensure the used Model 3 has all the advertised features.
Tesla VIN Decoder, Plus More Model 3 Info
Tesla made some key changes to the Model 3 over its lifespan. For instance, Tesla facelifted the Model 3 in October 2020. Vehicles built afterward can include a heat pump for more efficient climate control and better range performance in cold weather. Autopilot comes standard on Model 3s built after April 2019.
2024 Tesla Model 3 (Highland)
The Model 3 Highland update made significant tweaks, including updated FSD hardware and eliminating steering column stalks for turning and shifting gears. However, that won’t be relevant to vehicles built before 2024.
Tesla Model 3 interior
Both terms create confusion. A Tesla Model 3 must be monitored at all times and cannot drive itself. Autopilot is Tesla’s basic system. It includes lane centering and adaptive cruise control. Full Self-Driving is an expensive option that costs several thousand dollars, including advanced features like Navigation on Autopilot and the latest beta features Tesla believes will develop into autonomous driving.
Tesla Model 3s built after April 2019 came standard with Autopilot. These vehicles use Tesla’s HW3 hardware, which is ready for FSD. Some used Model 3s already have it equipped. Others can add it for a $99/month subscription plan. Model 3s running previous hardware should be eligible for a complimentary upgrade to HW3 with an FSD purchase. Highland Model 3s have upgraded HW4 hardware. Buyers can check the vehicle’s hardware configuration in a touchscreen menu.
Tesla Model 3 Long Range
EVs theoretically should have fewer weak points than combustion cars with fewer moving parts. But the Tesla Model 3 has had several issues reported with the front suspension and faulty steering and suspension components. The Model 3 also suffered several reported build quality issues early in its production. Keep an eye out for issues like misaligned panels, panel gaps and paint flaws.
Many of the glitches with Tesla Model 3s have been software-related. So, in addition to regular maintenance and recalls, ensure that the used Model 3 has all of its software updates and that its infotainment screen is operational.
Tesla Model 3 Performance 2024
Short answer: yes. All EV batteries degrade. The question is whether it is meaningful. A Tesla Model 3 probably won’t be able to match its precise EPA range estimate when new. Tesla estimates an average of 12 percent degradation for its batteries over 200,000 miles. Newer chemistries may outperform that.
There are methods to assess Model 3 battery degradation yourself. Model 3s from Hertz have a Recurrent range score detailing battery health and estimated range.
Tesla replaces batteries under warranty that have hit 70 percent capacity. A Model 3 with a battery in the 90s is ideal. A vehicle in the 80s should still have some serviceable life left. The battery dipping into the 70s is when there should be a concern. Most Model 3s should not be approaching that threshold yet.
Tesla Model 3 Long Range
Yes. Tesla Model 3s come with a basic four-year or 50,000-mile warranty. That warranty is transferred to the new owner. Moreover, if you buy a used Model 3 from Tesla, the brand either adds an extra year or 10,000 miles to the existing warranty or provides a new one-year or 10,000-mile warranty. Most Model 3s also have an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty on the battery and powertrain components.

Watch The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Take On The Kia EV6 GT In A Range Test,https://insideevs.com/news/743901/kia-ev6-hyundai-ioniq5-highway/,"The two vehicles are built on the same underpinnings, but their battery packs have different capacities.",12/10/2024 12:00,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is the newest high-performance EV from Hyundai-Kia. It has a larger battery pack and more power than the mechanically related Kia EV6 GT, and this is reflected in their EPA range ratings. However, their real-world range results are closer than the official estimates suggest, as demonstrated in this 70 mph highway range test comparison.
Out Of Spec Reviews posted this nearly one-hour-long range test video in which they drove the two cars until they were completely out of juice and stopped moving. Both cars have dual-motor configurations, but the newer Ioniq 5 N has a bigger 84-kilowatt-hour battery pack, while the EV6 GT has to make do with 77 kWh.
Kia has recently updated the EV6, equipping it with the same 84 kWh battery as the Ioniq 5. However, the EV6 GT in the video is the pre-refresh model, so it has the smaller battery, giving it a claimed EPA range of 206 miles. The larger-battery Ioniq 5 N is rated at 221 miles.
The result of the range test was surprising, though. The EV6 GT entered low-power mode after 214 miles and could no longer maintain 70 mph, and it was completely out of power after passing the 216-mile mark. The Ioniq 5 N could not maintain 70 mph after just under 212 miles, and it died shortly after, so even though it had a larger and newer battery, it lost to the older EV6.
The Kia was also more efficient, with a displayed average electricity consumption of 2.9 miles/kWh versus 2.7 miles/kWh in the Hyundai. This might come down to aerodynamics (the EV6 has a drag coefficient of 0.28 versus 0.29 in the Hyundai) or the rolling resistance of the different tires they were on.
The takeaway is that both vehicles can achieve (or come close to achieving) their EPA claim while driving constantly at 70 mph. As Kyle suggests in the video, the Ioniq 5 N they used in the video may have been used hard before they got the car, and this could have caused accelerated battery degradation and capacity loss.
With a battery that’s 8.5% larger than before, the updated Kia EV6 GT could get an EPA range rating of over 230 miles or close to 340 miles in the long-range rear-wheel-drive model with 19-inch wheels. The GT variant will also gain the Ioniq 5 N’s 641 hp motors and its simulated shifting, which isn’t as bad as you think. We wanted to hate the fake shifting too, but found it strangely entertaining in the Hyundai.

You Can Now Buy An Electric Hyundai On Amazon,https://insideevs.com/news/743902/hyundai-amazon-autos-live/,"Want a Hyundai EV, but don't want to endure Hyundai dealer shenanigans? Amazon Autos is the platform for you. Here's how it works.",12/10/2024 11:28,"It's hardly a secret that in 2024, Hyundai makes some of the best electric vehicles you can buy. The problem is that buying one means engaging with Hyundai's notorious network of American car dealers. So, if you'd rather take your chances on Amazon instead and you live in one of the 48 cities involved with the pilot, the newly launched Amazon Autos platform is for you.
Put more simply, the dream is finally real: the ability to pick out the car you want and arrange the financing, e-sign paperwork and delivery options completely online, without having to go to a physical dealership until it's time to take your new car home. It's a buying experience that fans of startup automakers like Tesla and Rivian have enjoyed for years, but now it's coming to a traditional car company as well.
Amazon Autos went live today and works with participating dealers in 48 cities, including New York, Austin, Miami, Dallas, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and more. (See a full list in this news release.) For now, the selections are limited to Hyundai's cars, as it was announced as the inaugural launch partner more than a year ago. However, that includes a wide range of electric, hybrid, and gas cars from the Korean automaker. Moreover, more options are coming.
""We continue to add more Hyundai dealerships, and next year, we will roll out additional manufacturers, brands, cities, and new functionality,"" Amazon officials said in a statement. ""With Amazon Autos, customers have a simple, end-to-end online experience to purchase their next vehicle.""
Just like buying anything else on Amazon, the process does seem rather simple and seamless.
Hyundai Amazon
When you click ""shop available cars,"" you're given a list of available Hyundai models near you—complete with photos—just as you'd see on Cars.com,  AutoTrader or another marketplace. But those platforms are for browsing; this is for buying. After searching for the car you want and filtering by various colors, features, and options, you click ""begin purchase,"" and you're taken to a window where you're asked to arrange financing or pay in full. (Leasing, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be an option for now, which means many of the great deals we've seen on Hyundai EVs have to be secured at the dealer.)
After that, you can figure out your trade-in value, set your down payment and monthly payments, apply for credit online if you need to, upload your documents, sign the contracts and then arrange a pickup from your local Hyundai dealer. In theory, this can be done in under half an hour, as opposed to the lengthy, hours-long process that usually entails buying from a dealer.
Hyundai Amazon
Another benefit of doing things this way is pricing transparency. ""The price customers see at check-out is the price they pay, inclusive of all taxes and fees,"" Amazon officials said. When you pick up the car, your dealer hopefully starts building a relationship with you to make sure you're happy and have any questions and service needs covered.
That's an area where Hyundai has often struggled in modern times. While the Korean automaker has transformed from a budget brand to one that's a world-class competitor to the likes of Toyota, Volkswagen and Tesla, it's often dogged by the reputation of its U.S. dealer network. Just recently, one InsideEVs staff member who sought to acquire an Ioniq 5 was repeatedly lured to various Hyundai dealers on the promise of super-low lease deals, only to get radically different quotes when he actually came in. So while Hyundai executives can't say this directly, and have not, this could be behind the company's motivations here.
For now, it's probably a good workaround. Hyundai cannot go full-bore into completely online sales in the U.S. because it's bound by franchise agreements with its existing dealer network, and legal wrangling between the dealers and the automaker reportedly held up the platform's launch. (See also how Volkswagen's dealers are throwing a fit after the new Scout Motors brand announced a plan to sell directly like Tesla does.) Dealers have also held up direct sales for many startup automakers in several states.
Still, it's increasingly odd that a new car is one of the few things you can't buy online in 2024. Amazon's efforts here could go a long way toward remedying that, especially as more car companies get added to the mix.

Jaguar's Rebrand Has An Even Tougher Foe: An EV War With China,https://insideevs.com/news/743787/jaguar-strategy-china-evs-glover/,"“If we make this a technical or price competition [against China], I’m not sure we can play to win."" Instead, ""sophistication in design"" is the answer.",12/10/2024 11:18,"Much has already been said about the relaunch of the Jaguar brand, most of it in the form of the vacuously cruel homophobic pablum that occupies much of the internet’s twiddling. A sliver of it has contained intelligent analysis. But little of it has looked at how the venerable, reimagined brand plans to address the world’s largest car market and the most cutthroat place on Earth to sell electric vehicles: China.
After all, China’s newcomer brands are rapidly displacing American, European and other Asian ones there as their EV technology quickly surpasses that of the rest of the world. At the same time, those Chinese automakers are the source of endless headaches for Volkswagen, Stellantis and others on their home turf. So as flashy and controversial as the leaping cat’s rebrand has been, it’s an open question how Jaguar 2.0 hopes to compete in China—and with China.
To remedy that, I sat down with Jag’s managing director, Rawdon Glover, in Miami, surrounded by the giant pastel pink walls and horizontal overhead streamers under which the brand’s Type 00 concept had been revealed, the mere hue of which cued shiftless gendered panic in so many keyboarding warriors.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Turns out, Jaguar has ideas about China. “As part of our strategy, we will be present in fewer markets, but we will want to really concentrate our efforts in those markets that are going to be super important for us,” Glover said. “And China, you can't ignore the largest automotive market in the world, the largest luxury market in the world. And so that's going to be going to be key for us as well.”
However, Glover admits that the British sport/luxury marque, unlike its Land Rover siblings, does not have a strong identity in that market—nor has it seen anything resembling strong sales there in about a decade.
“If I look at Range Rover, for example, it really resonates in China, and it’s very, very strong,” he said. “We've got some work to do with the Jaguar brand, which is really part of why we’re starting so early, because we probably won't be in China until 2027.”
Rawdon Glover
For more than a decade, the Chinese market has held intense sway in global automotive design, influencing everything from grille size to chrome adornment to interior materiality and ambiance. According to Glover, the response in China seems to favor the marque’s new design and identity, which may have some significant correlation with the rebrand’s very intentional audacity.
“The initial reaction I'm hearing from China has been really positive in terms of the direction,” he said. “It's very bold, is very evocative. And that plays well in that market, particularly among a lot of the young Chinese wealth. So, in terms of the repositioning, if we can connect into that in the right way, then I think we'll be on to something.”

Glover went on to describe some of the psychographic features that define this sought-after demographic category of young Chinese wealth. “We think people will be attracted to this who are independent-minded. They're interested in design. Clearly, there is a level of economics involved, but there are also people that want to make a bolder choice,” he said. “Somebody who wants to make a very conservative luxury choice, that's fine. We’re not going to be the brand for them. Jaguar is going to be a brand for people who make a really clear choice that they want to stand out from the crowd.”
In the two or three years between now and Jaguar’s first product deliveries in China, it has plenty of work to do, not just in terms of branding, but in terms of connecting with potential consumers. This provides further opportunity for reinvention, though nothing seems to be firmly set just yet. “We need to examine every single aspect of our customer journey if we're going to elevate the brand to the price point we’re projecting,” Glover said. “So, yeah, that's definitely on my to-do list.”
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
That price, in the U.S., will, according to Glover, begin at “about $120,000” for the four-door GT that Jag will release first in 2026, though cost will scale up significantly from there, given the pricey opportunities for personalization and individualization, opportunities that will be very important to the brand’s bottom line, as such optioning can add 50% or more to the sticker, and yield profits of as much as 80% for the automakers.
Glover expects that this elevated luxury positioning—along with outré design, and the intrinsic history and resonance of Jaguar—will also help insulate it from the onslaught of more affordable, Chinese-made electric vehicles that are flooding European, and other, markets.
“If we try and make this a technical or price competition [against China], I’m not sure that's a game we can necessarily play to win,” he said. “I also think that while there's lots of very, very competent vehicles coming out of China, I don't think they have the sophistication in design that that we have. Maybe that will evolve, but those are the two differentiators.”
2025 Nio ET9
Still, it is evident that, while the Chinese automakers have focused for now on the more mainstream EV market, it is inevitable that they will continue to elevate their offerings. So I asked Glover if he sees those manufacturers eventually turning their sights upmarket.
“I think I see them moving into the premium segment, or endeavoring to,” he said, citing the Nio ET9 sedan, which will be priced around £90,000 ($114,000). “How successful will that be? That's quite an elevated price point. We'll see how that does,” he says.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
He very intentionally positioned the new Jaguar brand in a category above premium. “I think luxury is another level,” he said. He offered a parallel in luxury consumer goods. “I’ve spent quite a bit of time in China. China is the single largest market for luxury brands outside of auto as well. And if you go to the luxury malls, it's the established global brands—Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton—that dominate. Because they've got history, they've got provenance. And that's what you're buying into. You don't see a whole rash of ultra-high-end Chinese brands appearing,” he said. “Now, maybe in time that's going to change. I suspect we're going to see something similar in the automotive space, certainly in the medium term. And by that, I mean 10-15 years. That's my take.”
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Recent history has proven that the Chinese market can shift and adapt rapidly. And Jaguar is on a cautious, years-long path in reintroducing itself there. Who knows where that market, or any of us, will be in 2027 and beyond. As a fan of the brand and its spirit, I hope Jaguar will make it. And that clearly means making it in China.

"NYC Wants To Make You License And Insure Your E-Bike, Sounds Like A Cash Grab",https://www.rideapart.com/news/743521/nyc-e-bike-license-and-insurance/,Do you think the City Council just wants a piece of the action?,12/25/2024 1:25,"If you rely on an e-bike in any way—you ride one, your business employs people who ride them, your takeaways are delivered atop an e-bike—you might be about to get screwed by the NYC Council. The NYC Council has proposed a bill that would require license plates and registration in the city for e-bikes and other electric micromobility vehicles. Although the bill hasn't passed the City Council yet, it very well might, as 30 lawmakers now back the bill. There'll be a hearing to advance the measure next week.
It's unknown how the process of registering the e-bikes with the DMV would go or how much it will cost, but there will certainly be a registration fee. But the financial burden of the new fee is likely to cost restauranteurs more than anyone else.
“Obviously, adding a registration fee is the city posing yet another financial burden on small businesses and workers,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, before adding, “The city already has a long list of requirements for restaurants that directly employ cyclists,” added Rigie. “We don’t need to double up and make things more confusing.”
The reasoning behind the bill is safety or, more specifically, a way to monitor unsafe riding and fine riders for bad behavior.
The bill was introduced by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, who had this to say, “All you have to do is walk down any street in New York City, and especially in Manhattan, to see the problem... I dare say almost every New Yorker has been hit or had a close call. This bill is not going to solve everything, but it will start to address some of it.” But, is this just another cash grab from another city council?
I can't comment on e-bike usage specifically in NYC, but I can tell you what I see in general. I see an economy where people can't afford to buy, run, or maintain cars and e-bikes as a viable economic alternative. Moreover, some businesses are thriving thanks to e-bikes, and there are more jobs as a result. In terms of urban economies, e-bikes have been working wonders for the last few years, making them the perfect target to be slapped with a ""registration fee"".
If you live in NYC and want to submit written testimony against the bill, you can do so here. You can also testify virtually or go in person at the hearing on December 11, 2024.
Let us know in the comments if you think this bill should pass or if it's simply another cash grab.

BYD Could Soon Outsell Ford And Honda,https://insideevs.com/news/743879/byd-outsell-ford-honda-2024/,"The Chinese giant was an unknown entity just a few years ago. Now, it's on course to topple two of the biggest names in the industry.",12/10/2024 10:00,"Everybody knows about BYD even if it doesn’t sell passenger cars in the United States. That’s because it’s one of the world’s largest automakers and at one point it was the largest all-electric car maker, toppling Tesla for a few short and sweet months.
But BYD is only getting started. After making a name for itself in China’s domestic car market as the leading builder of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), the company is coming after some of the biggest names in the industry: Ford and Honda, both widely recognized brands with rich histories behind them.
BYD Atto 3
But history can’t influence global buyers’ decisions, it seems, as BYD is on course to surpass Ford and Honda by the end of this year—if everything goes according to plan.
More On Chinese EV Makers
Last month, the Chinese automaker sold a whopping 506,804 vehicles around the world, according to data filed with Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday quoted by Fortune. But that’s not all—year-to-date, BYD has sold 3.7 million cars, a 40% increase from last year.
If the automaker manages to keep the impressive sales momentum through the end of December, it will most likely surpass its goal of selling four million cars globally. In the meantime, it could also pass Ford and Honda, marking a major shift in the way consumers around the world make their car-buying decisions.
In the first nine months, Ford sold 3.3 million cars globally, while Honda sold 3.1 million cars. If the two companies’ pace continues until the end of the year, we could see Ford closing 2024 with 4.3 million sales and Honda with 4 million units sold. If BYD ramps up sales by 100,000 units in December, its final tally for this year would be around 4.3 million units.
Next year, BYD aims to sell between 5 and 6 million cars, according to a Citi note published after a meeting with the automaker's management.
The Dolphin (left) and Seal (right), two of BYD's most successful models.
We’ll know for sure what the scoreboard will look like sometime in January, but whatever the results, one thing is clear: BYD is here to win. Even without a presence in the passenger vehicle market in the United States, its popularity skyrocketed in just a few short years, boosted by so-called traditional automakers’ inability to adapt to the intricacies of the Chinese car market.
BYD still has some work to do to topple the world’s top players, but if its previous performance is anything to go by, it won’t be long before we see its name at the top of the global automaker list. Volkswagen, for instance, sold 6.5 million vehicles in the first nine months of the year, while Toyota sold 8.3 million vehicles in the first 10 months. Tesla, meanwhile, delivered 1.3 million all-electric cars in the first three quarters–100,000 more than BYD. That said, BYD’s portfolio includes EVs and plug-in hybrids, which is why its overall sales figures are higher than Tesla’s.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla's 2025 Will Be 'A Year Of Product Launches',https://insideevs.com/news/743791/tesla-2025-year-product-launches/,"Plus, the Robotaxi launch is going to be a wild learning curve and Jaguar is increasing the price of its new EV.",12/10/2024 9:30,"The electric vehicle market is headed for a lot of uncertainty next year, but it's also growing ever more competitive. For brands just getting into the EV space, the sky's the limit and consumers are here for it. But for other automakers that have been around a while—looking at you, Tesla—putting some makeup on a seven-year-old car isn't exactly the recipe for success in the long run. And that's why Tesla is reportedly preparing some big product launches for 2025.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Tesla's robotaxi launch, the gas tax, and Jaguar's upcoming EV costing a small fortune. Let's jump in.
Tesla has officially hyped 2025 as a year of product launches—something which should excite investors (as long as they ignore the possibility of Tesla spending some serious cash) and seasoned Tesla-watchers digging for aspirin. And that all starts with multiple new vehicles reportedly planned for launch in 2025.
News of the product launches comes from a Deutsche Bank investor note shared with InsideEVs late Monday. The takeaways from DB outline the firm's talks with Travis Axelrod, Tesla's Head of Investor Relations, at Deutsche Bank's Autonomous Driving Day, including the launch of a mysterious new vehicle dubbed ""Model Q"" and several other key product offerings set to happen during the second half of 2025.
Starting off with Model Q—a name which was penned by Deutsche Bank, not Tesla, by the way—the automaker is planning an EV with a starting price of under $30,000. Just to be clear, that price includes U.S. federal tax incentives, meaning that if those are wiped from the face of the earth during the Trump administration, the vehicle will likely start around $37,499 instead.
The specifics of this model are currently unclear, however, the report from Deutsche Bank mentions this vehicle separately from the Robotaxi (which it calls the CyberCab in the report). Keep in mind that Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that it would be ""silly"" and ""pointless"" to have a $25,000 EV that wasn't a robotaxi, so maybe that extra $5,000 is for pedals and other things meant to put a human behind the wheel. Either way, it seems that Tesla's cheap EV might not be dead in the water as expected.
That vehicle is expected to be launched, or at least debuted, during the first half of 2025. And that's not all folks—the second half of the year will have ""other new vehicles released,"" according to the note. Yes, that's ""vehicles,"" plural.
The second half of 2025 is said to bring a three-row EV riding on a longer wheelbase than the Model Y released today. The idea is to expand Tesla's total addressable market—meaning those folks who want a three-row SUV and won't consider a Tesla since there's simply not one in its lineup today. Could this be Tesla's ""one more thing"" that could drop with the announcement of the refreshed Model Y Juniper? Maybe, however, that particular vehicle is expected to be released in the Chinese auto market and it's not clear if or when it will make its way to other markets.
Deutsche Bank doesn't note what other vehicles might release during the second half of the year, only that Tesla is expected to launch ""other new vehicles"" during that time.
One last note is that Tesla expected to launch all of these vehicles on existing production lines. That means it's possible that Tesla's semi-permanent Tent City could grow even larger as it stands up new additions to its lines in preparation to tool up for these new vehicles. It also means that Gigafactory Mexico's future is looking ever-bleaker, though a tariff-laden future under the incoming Trump administration could change that.
Keep in mind that this could all be Tesla blowing smoke. The company's track record for hitting deadlines and staying with its plans is, let's say, colorful. And as Deutsche Bank points out, if Tesla wants to grow its volume by 30% in 2025 as projected, it needs to execute its operations absolutely flawlessly—which isn't exactly something that Tesla has done in the past. Growth and success are all hinging on things moving swiftly and smoothly for Tesla. Can it do it?
Following Tesla's year of product launches will be the product that has investors really on the hook: the Tesla Robotaxi.
The Robotaxi, or CyberCab as Musk likes to call it, is Tesla's truly passive earner. Pop out a vehicle that costs between $20,000 and $30,000 to manufacture and set it loose on the world to deliver autonomous rides at the press of a button. Tesla believes that it can compete against rivals like Waymo and Cruise just by taking vehicle cost into consideration—that's not even talking about software performance versus Tesla's lack of complex sensors like Lidar in its autonomous vehicle hardware suite. But there's so much more at play here, and that's going to be the real learning curve for Tesla.
Deutsche Bank's note digs into the specifics of the Robotaxi operations and development which could prove to be roadblocks to CyberCab's rapid growth:
Tesla believes it would be reasonable to assume some type of teleoperatorwould be needed at least initially for safety/redundancy purposes.

[...]

Management intends to start off entirely with the company-owned fleet and eventually dynamically adjust supply based on customer demand/traffic patterns.
[...]
As the CyberCab rollout occurs in 2026, the company will need to make investments across its service/cleaning and charging apparatus (e.g., install wireless charging) with TX and CA likely the first states to see a rollout given proximity to manufacturing facilities and headquarters.
The analyst makes a great note regarding Tesla's current infrastructure. The CyberCab is ditching Tesla's NACS port for fully wireless charging. That should make topping off the battery a breeze versus the complex snake arm prototype that Tesla tried building almost a decade ago, however, Tesla's existing charging infrastructure isn't set up to wirelessly charge any vehicle, let alone a fleet of robotaxis. This means that Tesla also needs to update its infrastructure over the next year to overcome this challenge.
And it's not just about charging, either. Tesla's vehicles will have to be checked for cleanliness between rides and, if less than ideal, unsullied for the next rider. This could mean a team of actual people prepping vehicles like revolving doors.
Let's not forget about teleoperators either. As Tesla mentioned to Deutsche Bank, it's not unreasonable to assume that the automaker will need teleoperators to handle remote operations if something goes awry. Think of the Optimus robots at Tesla's We, Robot event, but on wheels and driving at speeds of 45 miles per hour. This isn't unheard of, though. Cruise and Waymo both have teleoperators and need them fairly frequently—but it's just one more tool that Tesla will need to add to its belt before this robotaxi thing can really get started.
Tesla does believe that it has an advantage over both of those competitors, though. As usual, the automaker critiques their so-called Lidar ""crutch""—so much so that Tesla's leadership isn't even viewing any brand as ""true competition"" in the U.S. and Europe from a cost and scale perspective. Tesla instead believes that both Cruise and Waymo are relying on these sensor suites to ""compensate for deficiencies"" in their software.
Mud-slinging won't get Tesla past the tipping point it needs to solve self-driving, though. It's got just two short years before it needs to have its Robotaxis stop slamming into curbs and driving onto sidewalks. Is that enough time to perfect its software and prepare its infrastructure for a whole new breed of cars? We're about to find out.
Jaguar is at a weird point in its life. The British marque has been frustrated with the move to EVs—which is odd considering it was one of the OG pioneers of electrification with the tightly-styled, albeit stagnant, Jaguar I-Pace. So rather than compete with the number of premium EVs out there teetering around the six-figure mark, Jag is going all-out and declaring its intention of re-branding as an ultra-luxury automaker.
That all starts with the recently unveiled Type 00 concept. I know it might look like some designers copied the ergonomics of an air conditioner, but this is Jag's attention-grabbing show of power—its ""new species"" of EV—in a market that is growing in competition. Its price? Well, Jag said that it's not rolling out of bed for anything less than $155,000 (120,000 British Pounds). Actually, scratch that. The price is going up.
Jaguar Land Rover CEO Adrian Mardell recently told Euro News that the true cost of its future EV will actually be closer to $190,000 (150,000 GBP), or around two-and-a-half times the cost of the outgoing I-Pace SUV.
The automaker expects to spend nearly $2 billion transitioning to electrification, and that plan includes taking an entire year off of selling cars in its home market. That means to break even on its massive investment, it somehow needs to sell more than 10,500 units of its ultra-luxury EV—and that's not accounting for the actual profit margin per vehicle.
In case you were wondering how much of a lift this will be, sales of Jaguar-branded cars in America hasn't exactly been great. Jag sold just 509 units of the $72,000 I-Pace in 2023, and 5,258 units of the $57,000 F-Pace (its best-selling model) in 2023.
Now, you have to remember, Jaguar is really aiming to shake up its buyers in this brand transition. It doesn't want Mercedes or BMW buyers anymore. The brand is just way too posh for the likes of them. Instead, it wants the folks who were considering Bentley or Maserati. But those aren't high-volume brands either—Bentley sold just 4,167 cars globally in 2023, and Maserati moved significantly more at around 26,600 units. Still, the point here is that Jaguar's market is quite limited and it will need to move some serious weight to make back its hefty investment. So perhaps a higher price per unit makes sense from that perspective.
The bigger question is if Jaguar can really convince buyers to divest from their current brand and buy whatever the final product of the ""unmistakable"" Type 00 really is. Sure, the concept is an eye-catcher. But so is the Tesla Cybertruck and look what kind of reception those owners are getting right now. If Jaguar doesn't get the buyers that it needs, it could spell disaster for the brand's future.
While Cruise and Waymo are seemingly looking to augment vehicle ownership in the big city, Tesla's move with the Robotaxi seems to be aimed at giving up vehicle ownership entirely. After all, if you manage to get the cost of ridership below that of owning a car, why would you own one?
I say this as someone who largely loves driving and holds the ""you can pry the keys from my cold, dead hands"" mentality toward car ownership, it would take a lot to convince me to give up my own car, even if it meant spending more to keep one in my driveway.
That being said, not everyone shares the same view. Some of you might live in a more urban area that has a better public transit system, or perhaps you rarely drive for another reason. So what would it take for you to give up vehicle ownership? Let me know in the comments.

It’s Getting Cheaper To Charge At Tesla Superchargers,https://insideevs.com/news/743824/tesla-supercharger-cheaper-prices/,EV drivers in the United States and Europe have noticed slight price reductions in the past week.,12/10/2024 4:03,"The Tesla Supercharger network is widely regarded as one of the best DC fast charging networks for electric vehicles in the United States. It’s a stress-free experience almost every time and there are stations almost everywhere.
However, there’s a price to pay for this. More often than not, charging at a Tesla Supercharger is more expensive than using rival charging operators like Electrify America, EVgo or ChargePoint, especially if you’re driving a non-Tesla EV.
Things are changing for the better, though, as charging prices at Tesla Superchargers across the United States and Europe have dropped slightly in the past week. The changes were noticed by @Electric_Maik on X, who posted several graphs showing the differences.
More EV Charging Stories
The price drops were confirmed by Max de Zegher, Tesla’s global Charging boss who was previously the Charging Director for North America.
“Some Supercharger price reductions overall,” de Zegher said. The goal is to lower the charging prices to accelerate EV adoption and to be financially sustainable by investing in the charging network, Tesla’s rep added.
Judging from the graphs embedded below, the price reductions aren’t exactly huge, ranging anywhere from 5 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, which amounts to a drop of around 7% depending on the location. That said, not all Superchargers are cheaper, so keep that in mind when setting off for your next road trip.
Another interesting piece of information revealed by Max de Zegher is that the Tesla Supercharger network delivered a record-setting 12 gigawatt-hours of energy to North American customers on November 30. That’s the Saturday after Thanksgiving when people were most likely traveling back home after the holiday.
We’d like to know what the pricing situation is like where you charge. Have the Supercharger prices gone down? Let us know in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tesla Confirms Sub-$30,000 'Model Q' For 2025: Deutsche Bank Report",https://insideevs.com/news/743793/tesla-model-q-2025-30000/,"It'll launch in the first half of next year, Tesla's head of investor relations told Deutsche Bank. It will be priced at $30,000 including subsidies.",12/9/2024 17:50,"Tesla will launch a sub-$30,000 vehicle after tax credits early next year, according to a report from Deutsche Bank after the firm met with the automaker's Head Of Investor Relations. Analysts at the firm are calling it the ""Model Q,"" though the name is in quotes and unofficial. But there are enticing new details about what this more affordable Tesla model might be, and its cost.
""The new Tesla model (we refer to as ""Model Q"") should launch in 1H25 and will be priced <$30k including subsidies (i.e., $37,499 if US EV tax credit goes away),"" the Deutsche Bank report said.
Tesla itself has not confirmed this news. But InsideEVs has seen the Deutsche Bank investor report on Tesla's plans for 2025, and the firm is claiming that the information comes directly from Travis Axelrod, Tesla's head of IR. The new model will be built on the company's existing product manufacturing lines, saving the company from the difficult and costly process of spinning up a new facility.
Tesla Model 2 Rendering
Tesla projected to Deutsche Bank that the new models would increase volumes by 20-30% over the next year, though profits will likely dip as the company spends big to get new models out the door.
That's right: New models. Not model. Deutsche Bank also says a long-wheelbase three-row Model Y is planned for China, too. That'll be a nice add in what's becoming a much more contested market for the EV giant.
But the so-called ""Model Q"" is a much bigger story. We don't have further details, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly hinted at a more affordable variant of the brand's existing products. Instead of an all-new platform—and all of the bug-testing, money and time that takes—he's suggested that the company can cut costs out of existing products.
New Tesla Model 3 interior
Given how stripped-down the Model 3 and Model Y already are inside, it's unclear what would be cut. The proposed Model Q could use cheaper or smaller batteries, less powerful motors or perhaps an even cheaper interior. Tesla could also cut out the ""Full Self-Driving"" hardware, but the dishonestly named software is so key to the company's current pitch as an AI company that it's hard to imagine it happening.
Either way, Deutsche Bank claims that the company plans to sell it for under $30,000 after the federal tax credit is applied. That means it'll be under $37,500, putting it right in the neighborhood of the $35,000 Chevy Equinox EV. With tax credits, the Equinox can be had for under $28,000, and it accomplishes that in part thanks to a low-power front-wheel-drive variant that's far cheaper than the AWD version.
But the Model Y and Model 3 are already sold as single-motor cars. The base Model 3 starts at $44,130 with destination before credits, while a rear-wheel-drive Model Y goes for $44,990. Cutting costs by another $7,000 will be tough, but the company does have options. The ""Standard Range"" Model 3 and Model Y no longer exist, and cutting the battery size would surely drive down costs. The Model Q could also be smaller, and offer fewer seats. Fewer parts could also decrease production costs.
After unveiling the Cybercab, Elon Musk poured cold water on the idea of an all-new, $25,000 Tesla with a steering wheel. But he left the door open for a cheaper, reworked version of an existing product.
For now, it's unclear. But for the first time, we have what is effectively official confirmation that a sub-$30,000 Tesla will be here soon. While the news isn't coming straight from Tesla, the brand's Head of IR wouldn't be telling Wall Street about a new model if it wasn't serious about bringing it to market.
I just hope Tesla can hit its deadline. But that's not usually a good bet to make.

Quad-Motor M Prototype Drive Left BMW Executives Speechless,https://insideevs.com/news/743751/bmw-m-quad-motor-video/,"BMW is experimenting with using four motors in future M cars, and they’re apparently very exciting to drive.",12/9/2024 13:00,"The Rimac Nevera is probably the most exciting EV to drive, but that’s not only because of its 2,000 horsepower output (it would still be ludicrously quick with half that). It all comes from using a quad-motor setup with advanced torque vectoring that can dramatically vary how the car behaves. Now imagine that same level of power and control but in a much more attainable (and possibly even four-door and wagon) body.
We’ve known for a while that BMW’s Motorsport division was looking to create quad-motor M cars, and the manufacturer has even shared some details and photos. But now this is the first time when BMW has shown the i4 M50-based quad-motor prototype, and it is quite exciting.
BMW M released a video showing the stages of testing and preparation it undertook to organize a drive event for the company’s board members. They are the ones who will ultimately decide if the company goes through with the quad-motor EV project, and they were apparently left speechless after experiencing the test mule.
There is surely a lot more that BMW isn’t showing us. The i4-based prototype is old now, and there are surely more advanced ones in testing right now. In the blurb accompanying the video, BMW notes that “at various secret test sites, the engineers are working flat out to develop the first fully electric high-performance M model.”
The manufacturer explains that “The fact that all four wheels are each driven by their own electric motor opens up completely new possibilities. Within milliseconds, the power and torque of the spontaneously reacting electric motors can be controlled with a precision that is unattainable with conventional drive systems.” This should result in more predictable and fun handling, bringing the driving experience closer to that of a combustion-powered M car.
BMW will keep selling combustion M cars in the future, but the electric models will represent the performance pinnacle with outputs as high as 1,000 horsepower. We know an electric M3 equivalent is in the works, which should debut as a production model in 2027 or 2028.
One of the very first performance EVs had a quad-motor setup, and it was a hoot to drive: the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive unveiled in 2012. Its four motors produced 750 hp combined, which allowed the car to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) from a standstill in 3.9 seconds, but they also bestowed it with great agility.
But that car was launched over 10 years ago. It was very expensive and low-volume and EVs have improved considerably since. There hasn’t been a sporty quad-motor EV since except for the Rimac Nevera and its sister car, the Pininfarina Battista, but those cost in the millions. BMW will offer attainable quad-motor EVs, likely starting a trend that could take over the sporty EV segment since it gives such a competitive edge.

Xiaomi's Tesla Model Y Fighter Looks Like A Budget Ferrari,https://insideevs.com/news/743754/xiaomi-yu7-crossover-china-ferrari/,"The Xiaomi YU7 is expected to take aim right at the Tesla Model Y, and looks like a Ferrari Purosangue.",12/9/2024 12:00,"It’s MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) day again in China: a day that’s definitely the bane of every tech and car producer who wants to sell in the country. The last step in Chinese market homologation is for the manufacturers themselves to submit photos and technical information to this state entity. Every few weeks or so, the Chinese government makes all this information public, whether the product or car has been officially revealed or announced. It sucks for manufacturers, but it’s a great way to see cars weeks before they’re unveiled.
Well, Xiaomi got in front of MIIT’s notoriously bad patent-style photos and released official images of its follow-up SUV mere minutes after MIIT leaked the photos. Xiaomi’s first crossover will be called YU7. It’s pretty dang slick-looking, that’s for sure.
Like the SU7 sedan, the YU7 has the same McLaren-esque front headlamps and single rear heckblende-crossed-with-Dodge’s-racetrack rear tail lamp assembly, but from there the designs diverge a lot. Xiaomi has embraced a decidedly low-slung, cab-rearward shape reminiscent of the Ferrari Purosangue. There are other details that set the cars apart, too. Whereas the SU7 has standard pull-style door handles, the YU7 trades that for hidden ones that will likely retract in and out of the car’s body.
The MIIT said the YU7 will have dual electric motors that are good for 681 horsepower, but there will be a slight bump over the dual-motor SU7 Max’s 664 horsepower. Slower, less powerful variants of the YU7 are likely to launch, but it’s not clear what the power levels of those units will be. Similarly, range, price, and battery size have also not been announced for the YU7. We do know that it will launch in June or July of 2025 and will be made in the same factory as the SU7 sedan. Some have speculated that the YU7 will follow suit as the SU7 and start directly equivalent to their Tesla competition. This means that when released, the YU7 could start at around $34,000, which is what a Tesla Model Y costs in China.
Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan has been a mega-hit inside of China. It has only been on the market since December 2023, yet Xiaomi has managed to hit its manufacturing target of 100,000 cars in a year more than a month ahead of schedule. It’s a well-reviewed car inside and outside of China, for good reason. When I got some seat time with the SU7 in Beijing this year, I found the SU7 to generally be impressive with respect to its design and perception of quality. The car is seamlessly integrated into Xiaomi’s other smart home products.
If Xiaomi’s YU7 has the same success as the SU7, and it likely will, then this is bad news for a lot of EV brands, both domestic Chinese and foreign rivals. Of course, the aging Tesla Model Y will face a huge challenge, but other brands might not have the brand recognition or value proposition that Xiaomi will undoubtedly offer on the YU7. The Chinese EV market is tough.
Other brands should batten down the hatches because there’s going to be a bloodbath next summer.

The Lucid Gravity Has Landed. Here's Why It Needs To Be A Hit,https://insideevs.com/news/743711/lucid-gravity-korea-battery-cm/,"Plus, South Korea is getting nervous about the U.S. battery boom under Trump, and Rivian's stock price is suddenly thriving.",12/9/2024 10:00,"I'll tell anyone who will listen that the Lucid Air is, in my humble estimation, pretty much the best electric vehicle you can buy in America today. The only problem is that it's an expensive electric luxury sedan tasked with keeping a promising startup afloat at a time when the market is moving away from all of those things. Some help is finally on the way in the form of the Lucid Gravity SUV, but it too arrives at a moment of profound uncertainty.
Can the family-friendly Gravity move the needle for Lucid Motors in 2025 and beyond? We'll look at that on today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and tech news. Also on tap today: South Korea has been cooking up a battery boom in the U.S., but now it's getting nervous about its prospects under the incoming Trump administration, and Rivian's stock price seems poised to end 2025 on a high note. Let's dig in.
2025 Lucid Gravity
Production of the Lucid Gravity officially kicked off last week at the startup's Casa Grande, Arizona factory, making good on a promise to do so before 2024 drew to a close. Lucid Motors' CEO Peter Rawlinson marked the occasion with these social media posts showing the first car driving off the assembly line:
It's hard to overstate just how much Lucid needs this car—and needs it to be a success. The California-based EV startup, now majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has done about all it probably can for now with the Air sedan and its starting-at-$70,000 price tag. Now it needs more mainstream models that can appeal to a wider audience, which will hopefully pay the bills until it can get more affordable mass-volume EVs on the road. If you think of the Lucid Air as a stand-in for the Tesla Model S, then the Gravity is the Model X until Lucid's ""Project Midsize"" can effectively become its Model Y.
Except I'd wager that the Model X was never quite the hit Tesla wanted it to be, and Lucid has no room for error at this point in its rise. Here's the latest from Automotive News on its financial situation:
Lucid needs the Gravity to be a hit, analysts said. The EV maker reported a third-quarter net loss of $950 million. That was wider than its second-quarter net loss of $790 million and its first-quarter net loss of $681 million. Lucid is majority owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The company said in its third-quarter earnings report that it had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.
Lucid’s stock price was down by about 50 percent from the start of the year to its closing price Dec. 5.
And then there's the question of price. The three-row Gravity will commence sales with the fairly loaded Grand Touring trim, and that will mean starting at $96,550 out of the gate. More affordable versions are expected to roll out but not until late 2025, and it's unclear if customer deliveries will start next year or in the remaining weeks of this one. Whenever that starts happening, we'll be looking closely at whether Gravity sales can propel Lucid to a more stable financial footing and prove to be a winner with buyers.
On its own, the Gravity seems to be a very impressive SUV; I've only sat in a few examples at auto shows so far but it's quite the stunner. The Grand Touring will pack an outstanding 440 miles of range as well. We'll have more on InsideEVs this week about what to expect from Lucid's next act.
GM Ultium platform with Samsung SDI prismatic batteries
Recent unpleasantness aside, America has every reason in the world to want to keep South Korea as a good friend. It's a crucial trading partner, a like-minded ally in a region increasingly dominated by China and a huge technology investor in this country as well. South Korea's battery expertise and industry are probably second overall to China's (albeit a very distant second, unfortunately) so the U.S. does need its help to catch up there.
Yet the copious battery plant investments in the U.S. from companies like LG, SK On, Samsung and various suppliers are starting to look a little uncertain if the incoming Trump administration does in fact revoke the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax breaks and other subsidies. Here's Bloomberg to explain:
Some Korean companies have slowed or hit the pause button on any ongoing construction of some plants because they’re concerned about reduced demand for EVs and what Trump would do during a second term in the White House, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Posco Future M, which makes cathodes for General Motors Co., said in a filing in September that it is delaying the completion of its plant in Quebec due to “local conditions.”
Although companies haven’t taken any action yet, many are “anxious” about to what degree Trump would slash government incentives for the EV market, said Kenny Kim, chief executive officer at SNE Research, a Seoul-based research firm that focuses on Korean battery makers.
Ending hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax credits and other incentives would threaten tens of thousands of US jobs and undo years of work shifting the global EV supply chain away from China. It could also hit the earnings of Korean firms, key US partners in the effort to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers, at a time when they’re already suffering from weaker demand for EVs and falling battery prices.
And then there's the problem with China. Trump's calculus there could be quite different from Biden's, including allowing more of that country's battery plants to invest here as part of some kind of broader trade deal. This would be devastating to such an important U.S. ally:
Korean companies also worry Trump might allow Chinese battery companies to enter the US. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd, or CATL, said it will consider building a US plant if Trump opens the door, Reuters reported last month.
The IRA has so far blocked investments from China, asking carmakers to gradually reduce sourcing critical battery minerals from “foreign entities of concern.”
“China’s entry to the US would be a disaster for Korea,” said Park Chulwan, a professor in the car engineering department at Seojeong University. “Chinese battery firms would offer much lower prices.”
We're in for a very interesting year ahead.
2025 Rivian R1S
But hey, it's not all doom and gloom on the EV front. If you're a fan of Rivian, or have money in the company, things are looking up with its stock price. RIVN has gained quite a bit over the past month amid its investment from Volkswagen, declining sales of electric competitors, a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan and a healthier overall balance sheet. From The Motley Fool:
Rivian's R1T is one of just a few electric pickup truck offerings. Tesla has entered the market with its unique Cybertruck, but the R1T's biggest competition is arguably Ford's F-150 Lightning. And it's news about the Ford EV that may have had Rivian stock jumping by nearly 10% Friday morning. At 1:55 p.m. ET, Rivian shares still held on to a gain of 4.5%. The move has helped Rivian stock log an increase of more than 20% in the last month.
Last month, Rivian told investors it expects to deliver between 50,500 and 52,000 EVs this year. That would only slightly surpass 2023 deliveries. But the company also recently provided encouraging news related to its future capital position. And it is preparing to start production of its next-generation R2 platform next year as well.
That has bolstered the stock recently, and yesterday it got another boost when Ford released its November vehicle sales update. That's because sales of Ford's F-150 Lightning plunged by 17% last month year over year.
Still, Rivian is a long ways off from the launch of the R2. We'll see how it can keep this momentum going in the meantime.

Would You Ride This Weird Solar-Powered Electric Scooter?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743297/otherlab-lightfoot-solar-powered-escooter/,Maybe if it was the only way to get around after the end of the world.,12/25/2024 1:25,"We’ve seen some pretty crazy e-mobility gadgets and gizmos over the years—everything from ultra-high powered e-bikes to electric scooters that look like they belong in a sci-fi movie. But the weirdest and most attention-grabbing of them all just has to be this electric scooter that’s powered by good old-fashioned sun juice.
It’s called Lightfoot, the brainchild of Otherlab, a mobility startup with a knack for all sorts of weird and wonderful inventions. They describe it as a sun-powered cargo scooter perfect for short trips. Think of it as a cross between a bicycle and an e-scooter—easy to use, undeniably practical, and pretty charming.
With a top speed of 20 miles per hour, it’s not going to win any drag races. But it’s got retro vibes inspired by classics like Vespa scooters and even the VW bus, at least according to Otherlab. The company markets it as a fun, do-it-all micromobility device.
But personally? I think looks like the kind of thing you’d rely on if the world was ending and gas pumps—and maybe even power outlets—were a thing of the past.
Picture this: the world has fallen victim to a massive solar storm or some apocalyptic event where the power grid is rendered useless. What’s left? The sun, of course. And with Lightfoot capable of making up to 20% of its power from the sun’s rays, it just might be your ticket to survival. That is, assuming you’re not fighting off zombies, of course.
Here’s what’s under the two massive solar panels that double as the two-wheeler's bodywork: a 48-volt, 1.1 kWh battery feeding two 750-watt motors that crank out 90 Nm (67 pound-feet) of torque. It can handle pretty much any hill, making it perfect for navigating a desolate wasteland—or just your local neighborhood with some steep climbs. It’s got a range of 37 miles per charge, so you won’t be left stranded.
On cloudy days, or when you need to go out at night, you won’t need to worry, either. And that’s because the Lightfoot isn't powered solely by the sun. The scooter is equipped with an onboard 600W charger that can juice it up to 80 percent in 90 minutes from a standard 110-volt socket.
With all that being said, we’re not in a post-apocalyptic world just yet, but the Lightfoot is definitely not your average e-scooter. In a sea of sleek, modern designs, this retro, steampunk oddball sticks out—and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, sometimes being different is what makes all the difference.

How To Maximize Your Electric Car's Range In Cold Winter Weather,https://insideevs.com/news/650826/maximize-ev-range-in-winter/,"Electric cars are known for losing efficiency in the winter. However, there are many ways to recuperate these losses.",12/9/2024 8:44,"Electric cars boast excellent efficiency, performance, and versatility, especially when compared to their ICE counterparts. However, EVs are notorious for getting hit with substantial range losses in cold weather. These efficiency blows generate some concern with prospective owners in northern climates. But, there are ways to nullify some cold weather losses and maintain a respectable energy consumption figure.
YESSS Electrical recently compiled a list of the best ways to increase winter range. Without further adieu, here are the best ways to improve your EV's overall usability in the winter.
In the dead of winter, preconditioning your battery prior to plugging in can mean much faster DC fast charging times. Since Li-ion batteries like to be relatively warm to rapidly charge or discharge, preconditioning the battery pack before charging gets your EV's battery ready for a speedy charging session.
Some EVs, like Tesla products, have this feature built into the UI, so the battery will automatically warm up before arriving at the station. This feature isn't available in every EV, but if yours is equipped, it'll mean that your car can reach its maximum charge rate much faster.
Leaving your EV sitting out in the cold, especially unplugged, must be avoided at all costs if you want to maximize range. Doing this is commonly referred to as ""cold-soaking,"" and the disadvantages are omnipresent. Besides taking a considerable efficiency loss when driving, DC charge rates will be reduced, and power could be limited too. If you can't park your car inside, try to leave it plugged in so you can at least warm the car with shore power before driving.
The best way to maximize your charge is to use shore power to heat up your ride directly. Instead of waiting until driving to begin heating the cabin, doing so while charging is the best way to conserve your battery's energy. The best time to do this is around 15 minutes before you leave.
Some EVs allow you to set scheduled departure times, allowing the car to activate the cabin heater automatically. Plus, once the cabin is sufficiently warmed, you can tick down the fan speed while driving to avoid using excess energy.
With electric cars (and plug-in hybrids, for that matter), keeping your car's tires within manufacturer specs is ideal for getting the best range. Since electric powertrains are so efficient, unnecessary friction resulting from improperly inflated tires will eat into your car's range.
Tesla says that a 6-degree Celsius (10-degree Fahrenheit) drop results in a loss of 1 PSI. This means that once the weather gets cold, checking your pressure is vital to maintain the intended specifications.
In the winter, the cold temperatures will reduce your EV's overall efficiency. Keeping this in mind, it's essential to drive especially nicely to account for the losses. This means that instead of driving at 75 mph on the freeway, it might help to tick down your speed to 70 mph.
Cold weather also might adversely affect your vehicle's regen abilities, so anticipating stops is equally important. Overall, if you plan on going on a winter road trip, it's important to consider ways like these to boost your efficiency.
Whether or not your EV has a heat pump, it'll still make a difference to utilize the seat heater over the heating system in cold conditions. Especially if you preheat the cabin while charging, running the cabin heater may be unnecessary. In this case, utilizing the seat heater could be a supplemental addition for comfort without the expense of using the entire cabin climate system.

Winter Highway Range Test Compares Three New Electric Luxury SUVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743632/macan-q6-polestar3-winter-range/,"The Audi Q6 E-Tron, Porsche Macan EV and Polestar 3 are priced to compete with one another, but which one uses fewer electrons?",12/9/2024 6:36,"Cold temperatures make EVs use more electricity, which can reduce their range by as much as 50% in some cases. Even the newest models, like the Audi Q6 E-Tron, Porsche Macan EV and Polestar 3, which feature the latest advancements in battery chemistry and thermal management, are at their least efficient in winter. If you also drive them at highway speeds, the range takes an even bigger hit.
Kris Rifa from Norway brought these three posh new electric crossovers together for a group highway winter range test. All three vehicles were driven at a constant 75 mph (120 km/h) on a 120-mile (194 km) route, and their average efficiency was monitored throughout the trip.
The test was done in Norway with temperatures as low as 23°F (-5°C), which made all three EVs a lot less efficient than advertised. The temperature inside the vehicles was set to 70°F (21°C), and they were exclusively driven in their most efficient mode. The Macan EV didn’t have a range-boosting mode so it was driven in normal.
Of the trio, the Polestar 3 (which was the largest of the trio with the longest wheelbase) was rated as being the most luxurious, quiet and comfortable for highway driving, while the Audi was considerably noisier than the other two EVs. The Polestar also had the largest battery pack of the test (107 kilowatt-hours usable versus 94.9 kWh in the mechanically related Porsche and Audi).
At the end of the test, which involved going up and down the same piece of highway, the Polestar looked like it was capable of delivering the longest range. They didn’t drain the three vehicles’ batteries all the way down and instead calculated the theoretical maximum range by looking at the usable battery pack and efficiency numbers.
The Polestar 3 long-range dual-motor used in the test had an average electricity consumption of 2.15 miles/kWh (28.8 kWh/100 km), which gave it a theoretical range of 225 miles (360 km) or around 57% of its claimed WLTP range of 394 miles (634 km). This variant has a more conservative EPA range of 315 miles (507 km).
Next came the Audi Q6 E-Tron Quattro, which was the most efficient of the three cars tested, averaging 2.42 miles/kWh (25.7 kWh/100 km), and it almost matched the Polestar for theoretical range with 223.9 miles (358 km). That’s 64% of its WLTP range of 344 miles (554 km) and even closer to its 307 miles (494 km) EPA rating.
Even though the Porsche Macan is built on the same PPA platform as the Q6 E-Tron, the Macan 4 used in this test was less efficient than the Audi (likely because of its larger wheels). It averaged 2.28 miles/kWh (27.2 kWh/100km), which only gave it a theoretical range of 211.5 miles (338 km) or around 63% of its WLTP range. The EPA rates the Macan 4 at 308 miles, one mile more than the Q6 E-Tron with the same configuration.
Kris also released a video showing a more in-depth side-by-side comparison of the three vehicles and he also charges them after the range test without preconditioning their batteries with interesting results. What struck me while watching these two videos was just how different the Audi and the Porsche are even though they are mechanically very similar just how tasteful the Polestar's interior looks.

Here’s What A Zero Star EV Crash Test Looks Like,https://insideevs.com/news/743705/zero-star-ev-crash-test/,"Lacking basic safety equipment like seatbelt pre-tensioners and load limiters, the Neta V is becoming famous for all the wrong reasons.",12/9/2024 6:32,"New cars are supposed to be much safer than their predecessors. With cutting-edge development and manufacturing techniques, you’re more likely to walk away from a car crash today than you were a decade ago. Sure, the car might be totaled, but that’s just metal, it can be replaced–your life can’t.
That’s the idea, at least. But not all cars are created equal. Enter the Neta V, a Chinese-made relatively affordable electric car that’s also sold in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand. It’s a front-wheel drive subcompact crossover with a theoretical range of up to 249 miles and basic amenities.
Priced between the equivalent of about $18,000 and $22,000, depending on the market, it’s billed as a “Stylish and Intelligent SUV for Young.” It’s also one of the least safe new cars on sale in the world today.
More EV Safety
After being crash tested by the New Car Assessment Program for Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP), the Neta V received a total safety score of zero stars out of five. Similar performances–or rather, disappointing results–were scored by the venerable Renault Zoe EV, as well as another Chinese-made EV, the JAC E10x.
According to ASEAN NCAP, the Neta V got zero points for the frontal offset crash test, where the driver dummy had “poor protection on the head, neck, chest and lower leg.” The Motorcycle Safety score was also zero. For what it’s worth, the EV got some points for adult occupant protection, child occupant protection and safety assist systems for a grand total of 28.55 points out of 100 possible.
After the frontal offset crash test, where the car moves at 40 miles per hour before slamming into a barrier, the A-pillar and steering wheel were displaced from their original position. ASEAN NCAP noted that the EV has a “weak body structure” and “compromised restraint system” that greatly endangers occupant safety.
The Neta V comes as standard with just two front airbags, a seatbelt reminder for the driver, ABS and stability control. There are no advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), no seatbelt retractor pre-tensioners and no seatbelt load limiters.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis Promises Half-Price Lithium-Sulfur EV Batteries ‘By 2030’,https://insideevs.com/news/743674/stellantis-cheaper-lithium-sulfur-ev-batteries-2030/,"The auto giant is joining forces with Zeta Energy to bring cheaper, lighter and faster-charging EV batteries to market by the end of the decade.",12/9/2024 3:36,"Solid-state batteries are not the only technology that promises increased range, lower manufacturing costs and lower weight. It’s also not the only technology that’s “just around the corner” for tomorrow’s electric vehicles.
Lithium-sulfur batteries carry many of the same promises as solid-state cells. They’ve been around for decades and are known among scientists for their great energy density, but a huge problem has been keeping them from going mainstream: they have a tendency to degrade quite quickly, making them unsuitable for electric cars that need to provide consistent driving ranges for years and year.
Here’s where Stellantis and its new partner, Zeta Energy, come into play. The two companies announced they’re working on a new generation of lithium-sulfur batteries that have the potential to provide the same usable energy as today’s liquid-based lithium-ion batteries but at half the price. They’re also poised to offer 50% more driving range and 50% faster charging sessions, which could make EV ownership a breeze.
More Battery Stuff
Development is already underway and the agreement includes both pre-production and planning for future scale production by 2030.
“Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,” said Ned Curic, Chief Engineering and Technology Officer at Stellantis. “Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis’ commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.”
Another huge benefit of lithium-sulfur cells is they don’t require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel, which are mainly sourced from outside the United States and Europe. Instead, they’re produced using waste materials, unrefined sulfur and methane. Furthermore, existent battery facilities can be used to manufacture the cells with materials sourced exclusively from domestic supply chains in Europe or North America.
This isn’t the only battery-related project brewing at Stellantis. The auto giant is also working on solid-state batteries with Factorial, and the first Dodge Charger EV pilot fleet with liquid-less cells is slated to hit the streets by 2026.",Iulian Dnistran
Rivian Is Last In Consumer Reports' Reliability List.

BMW too only finished in the middle of the reliability surveys, while Chevrolet—the top non-luxury brand in satisfaction—was even lower when it came to reliability. (If you want a car that ranks high in both, get a Lexus.)
Owners ranked their Rivians high for comfort, speed, drivability and ease of use. They may also have been won over by the cars' specs. While their large size and brick-like shape can hurt their electric efficiency, Rivian's EVs offer between 260 to 400 miles of range or more and boast some of the most advanced software features available in the U.S. EV market, including continual over-the-air updates.
2025 Rivian R1S
But as we reported earlier this week, because they represent a new type of technology that's less ironed out than the purely internal combustion vehicles made over the last century, EVs and hybrids do seem to have more issues than their conventional counterparts. Thankfully, CR told InsideEVs in an email, that's changing quickly. ""On average, EVs from the past three model years have had 42% more problems than gas-only cars, according to our exclusive survey data. That might sound like a lot, but the figure represents a significant improvement over our previous year’s survey results when EVs had 79% more problems than gas-only cars.""
Rivian's issues were not uncommon to some new EVs: problems with charging systems and electric motors, frustrations with in-cabin technology like the central touchscreen, climate system headaches and more. Yet some of Rivian's quality problems also speak to the nature of being a startup that's new to making cars: paint and trim issues, noises and leaks, hardware issues and more. ""All of that confirms what our survey data has told us for years,"" CR said. ""Tried-and-true designs tend to be more reliable, and consumers would be wise to wait a few years before purchasing a vehicle that’s been designed—or redesigned—from scratch."" (CR lacked sufficient owner data for other newcomers like Polestar and Lucid.)
2025 Rivian R1
The publication certainly isn't wrong there and another EV startup is a good example. For years, Tesla also ranked at the top of owner satisfaction surveys but the bottom of reliability and quality reports. Yet while it still struggles with new model launches, Tesla's overall build quality has gotten much better over the years; cars like the Model 3 and Model Y scored ""average"" in CR reliability reports. The brand as a whole still ranks toward the bottom of CR's rankings, however, but above traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Jeep.
The takeaway here? People love what their Rivians can do for them, but like many startups, the company has a ways to go to improve its overall build quality and how seamless its user experience can be. Hopefully Rivian can do this as it continues to ramp up its Normal, Illinois plant and expands into an all-new one in Georgia.
Do you own a Rivian? What's your experience been with it, good or bad? Let us know in the comments.

"Tesla FSD Tester: V13.2 Is 'Unbelievable, Incredible' But Still Has Bugs",https://insideevs.com/news/743617/tesla-fsd-v13-impresses-reviewer/,"FSD still has a long way to go before it makes something like a fully autonomous robotaxi real, but the progress is easy to spot.",12/8/2024 10:00,"Tesla has incrementally improved its Full Self-Driving suite over the years, but some new versions have proved better. FSD version 13.2 is one of those versions that marks a more significant leap with its newly added features and general improvements. The biggest news is its ability to move the car out of a parking spot and search for parking at or around its destination.
Version 13.2 has only been rolled out to early-access members of the FSD program, and it's been getting rave reviews. Although testers also praised FSD V12 as a big step forward, V13.2 seems to be a huge leap in comparison. Don’t get too excited, though, because as promising as the new version is, the road ahead until FSD achieves true unsupervised autonomous driving is still long.
Before V13 began being pushed to users, Elon Musk said this new version was “trending to be ~500% better,” hinting that it was a major upgrade over V12. Now, we have to wait and see how it performs once it reaches all those who are part of the FSD program. Gauging how good it is will basically boil down to how many critical disengagements they observe over a set distance and if there are noticeably fewer of them than before.
One video that we previously covered showed that while FSD still has a few bugs to iron out, especially when it comes to finding parking once it’s completed a set route, this is FSD’s best showing so far—driving from point to point is smoother and more confidence-inspiring than before. AI Drivr called it “unbelievable,” “incredible” and “mind-blowing” several times during the almost 40-minute-long drive that they posted a few days ago.
Situations like the right turn followed immediately by a left turn shown at the start of the video would not have been handled as smoothly as V13.2 did. Even though the car had to take a lot into account to perform the maneuver, especially considering how heavy the traffic was—which required extra incisiveness—it did it about as well as a human driver.
AI Drivr also engaged FSD while their Model Y was parked beside a Supercharger. It was really cool to see the car not setting off immediately as it checked its surroundings and waited for a gap in traffic. Being in the leftmost charging stall right next to a curb, the car could have easily scratched its wheels when it made its left turn, but it detected that and pulled to the right before making the left turn.
What’s even cooler about that particular instance was that the car changed its route through the parking lot on the fly. While it initially suggested that it would go right after coming out of the parking spot, it actually first made a left and then turned right, giving a glimpse at its neural network-powered decision-making in action on the fly.
It also slowed down enough for speed bumps, which wasn’t always the case with V12, or older iterations. The FSD tester concluded that V13.2 “is freakishly good. By far the biggest step change improvement from any version that has EVER come out. It still has some small weird bugs (refer to video) and also executes some pretty aggressive maneuvers at times (even on ’Standard’ profile) that I think would be a disengagement for the majority of people, but I absolutely love it.”

The EU Is Pushing For Stricter E-Scooter Safety Standards,https://www.rideapart.com/news/742989/eu-scooter-safety-standards-recommended/,"E-scooters have been around for a while now, so why is the EU only acting now?",12/25/2024 1:25,"For many people around the world, electric scooters and other small e-mobility devices have changed their lives. Moving around the city has never been this easy. Simply charge up your little scoot, throw on your going-out clothes and maybe a backpack, and be on your merry way. No more queueing up at a bus stop or dealing with apps like Uber or Lyft.
But as is always the case when it comes to all things mobility, a balance between safety and convenience always has to be struck.Up until now, rules and regulations surrounding the use of e-scooters have been inconsistent and confusing at best. This is where the ETSC, or the European Transport Safety Council steps in, as it now calls for the development of mandatory requirements for all e-scooters sold in the European Union.It’s about damn time, isn’t it?It all seems pretty reasonable, really, and it’s surprising that the EU is adopting these measures only now, especially given that so many e-scooter-based ride-sharing platforms have been banned across Europe due to safety concerns.
E-scooters are recommended to have a top speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
So, what are the technical requirements? Well, for starters, all e-scooters should include a speed limiter set at 20 kilometers per hour (around 12.4 miles per hour). Minimum braking and maximum acceleration parameters will also be set. So yeah, no more “super e-scooters” capable of hitting speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour.
But apart from mandating technical requirements surrounding scooters, the ETSC also recommends regulating folks who can actually ride them. For starters, the council recommends a minimum age of 16 for e-scooter riders. Plus, riders will also be required to wear a helmet every time they hop aboard an e-scooter. Naturally, individuals who have consumed alcohol or are under the influence of drugs, will not be allowed to ride.
All these regulations make sense, right? And there are numbers to back them all up. The ETSC highlights that there have been 119 reported road deaths in 2022, all of which involve “motorized micro-mobility devices,” of which the vast majority are electric scooters. And the fact that between half and two-thirds of the reported deaths involved riders who were intoxicated makes this even more grim.
So yeah, play stupid games, win stupid prizes, I guess.
But things might actually be much worse than they seem. The ETSC reports that many crashes and injuries involving e-scooters involve only the rider, and no one else. As such, it’s more than likely that the number of e-scooter fatalities is actually much higher, it’s just that there are lots of unreported cases as the police may not necessarily have been called to the scene.

"Non-Tesla EV Roadtrips 'Sucked' Last Year. Now, They're ‘Dramatically’ Better",https://insideevs.com/news/743502/non-tesla-ev-road-trip-ccs-or-supercharger/,Is having access to the Tesla Supercharger network really such a big deal? This YouTuber set out to find out.,12/7/2024 10:00,"The list of non-Tesla electric cars that can access the Tesla Supercharger network in the United States and Canada is growing. Fast. Overnight, owners of EVs like the Rivian R1T, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Chevrolet Blazer EV suddenly received access to over 17,000 fast chargers that were previously exclusive to Tesla owners.
That’s on top of what’s already available from the myriad of smaller public charging operators like EVgo, Electrify America, ChargePoint and more, whose charging stalls more often than not come with CCS cables instead of Tesla’s NACS connector.
In total, owners of EVs that can top-up at both Tesla Superchargers and CCS stalls from other operators have over 37,000 ports at their disposal in the United States, according to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center. The Tesla Supercharger network has over 28,000 ports, but roughly 10,000 of those are still exclusive to Tesla EVs.
More Stuff Like This
In other words, there’s a lot of choice. So much so, that Robert Dunn from the Aging Wheels YouTube asked if having access to the Tesla Supercharger network is really such a big deal now. So he set out to see what the charging situation was like on a 400-mile trip from Saint Louis, Missouri to Chattanooga. Tennessee.
Last year, he did the experiment using a Polestar 2 and a rented Tesla Model 3. In the Tesla, he only used Superchargers and the experience was flawless. In the Polestar, he only used CCS chargers and he had nothing but issues.
This year, he repeated the experiment with the same Polestar 2 and a Kia EV6. The Polestar now has access to the Supercharger network and that’s what was used to top-up the batteries, while the Kia was only recharged at CCS fast chargers.
Dunn tried almost every charger on the 400-mile route, albeit for short periods of time, just to see if the stalls worked and how fast they were. The short answer is that things have improved “dramatically” since last year. Old CCS chargers were either upgraded or replaced, and more of them have been installed along the route.
The long answer is in the video embedded above.
Some CCS chargers were a bit of a pain in the neck to activate, and there’s still the need for multiple smartphone apps to use all of them, but the good part is that, at least on this route, things are much better. So better in fact, that you might not even need to use Superchargers in a non-Tesla EV during a road trip, but if you need them, they’re there.
More choice means less charger anxiety and fewer worries.",Iulian Dnistran
Could Mass EV Adoption Save Motorcycles In Vietnam's Major Cities?,https://www.rideapart.com/features/743279/vietnam-ev-motorcycles-pollution-2030/,"By 2030, big changes are coming to the nation's riding habits, one way or another.",12/25/2024 1:25,"If you pay any attention to those periodic lists of the top cities in the world with the worst air pollution, chances are excellent that you've seen Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, on the list more than once.And of course, if you either live there or have ever visited, you probably weren't surprised. More likely, you were just happy to confirm your sneaking suspicion that it's not great for any living creatures that like to, you know, breathe.
As you may or may not be aware, Vietnam is also a nation where two-wheeled transportation is massively popular. There are cars, buses, and trucks on public roads, too, but it's hard to understate the sheer volume of motorbikes you'll see on the road (and the sidewalk), especially if you visit any major city. I've been there; I've seen it in person. The flitting and zooming of untold numbers of small-displacement motorbikes in Hanoi puts even Bangkok to shame.
Put another way, Statista noted that over 65 million motorcycles were registered in the country as of 2020. Just four years later, Agence France-Presse (AFP) estimated the number at closer to 77 million. And the majority of these motorbikes are small-displacement ICE machines.
Of course, if you live or work in a major city like Hanoi, you have a vested interest in making your air quality better. So, even though so many everyday people rely on bikes as their main means of transportation, that's why more than one effort to restrict or even ban motorbikes from certain congested areas has arisen over the years.
In June 2023, the city of Hanoi's People's Committee officially approved a motorcycle restriction program for 12 major districts of the city. If enacted as planned, it would result in a total ban on motorcycles in those districts by 2030. Ouch.
As we stand on the precipice of 2025, that's only five years away. That's likely why both the government and Vietnam's homegrown EV industry are pushing so hard to get riders to adopt EV motorbikes en masse. So far, they have yet to catch on in big numbers, for a number of reasons you've probably already seen raised in other markets as well. While the bikes on sale can be charged at home, charging-related fires are a motivating fear.
Misinformation about a fire in Hanoi in 2023 that killed 56 people reportedly resulted in other apartment buildings putting the kibosh on EV charging altogether. An investigation by police later revealed that EV charging wasn't the cause of that fire, but by the time the truth came to light, the damage to public confidence was already done.
Hanoi Plans Motorcycle Ban
There are also the usual concerns about lengthy charging times, as well as up-front costs to purchase a whole new motorbike and concerns about the high cost of future battery replacement once your original battery is no longer usable.
OEMs are addressing these issues in different ways. When I had the chance to ride several of Vinfast's electric scooters a couple of years ago, the company touted a program where riders could purchase the scooter outright, and then pay a low subscription fee for the battery.
And while I'm usually against anything that resembles ""software-as-a-service"" or ""battery-as-a-service"" or (shudder) ""motorcycle-as-a-service,"" this idea actually made sense to me.
Why? Because EV batteries are, in a single word, expensive.
Under this plan, Vinfast would own the battery, and once its charge capacity dipped below a certain point spelled out in the agreement that you'd sign, you'd be able to simply return it to the company in exchange for a new one. Assuming the company kept its word and honored that agreement, it seemed like the kind of thing that could do a lot to allay fears of suddenly having an EV motorbike-shaped paperweight parked out front.
That was two years ago. And although Vinfast's EV cars have received a slew of negative reviews here in the States since their release, their scooters (which we don't so far get) still seem to have this battery subscription model available in their home country in 2024. And the costs of ownership are exactly the same as they were when I first rode them, according to the Vinfast website. What else can you say that about in 2024?
But what if, for any number of valid reasons, you don't want to charge your EV motorbike at home? That's where another Vietnamese EV motorbike maker called Selex is aiming its offerings. Since so many riders use motorbikes as delivery vehicles, it's aiming its swappable battery-equipped Selex Camel firmly at those riders. And it's been busy setting up battery swapping stations in major cities, so that riders can simply pull up, swap batteries, and be on their way with minimal time lost.
The road to EV motorbike adoption is all uphill at this point. But if enough people adopted them in Hanoi and beyond, could that convince the city to reconsider enacting its pending motorcycle ban? It seems like the most agreeable solution for the greatest number of riders, honestly, so here's hoping it does.

Record Hybrid Sales Helped Boost 'Green' Car Sales In Q3,https://insideevs.com/news/743562/record-hybrid-sales-boost-electrified/,"EV sales also grew compared to last quarter, but their market share shrank slightly.",12/6/2024 17:14,"Although Americans bought more new electric vehicles in the third quarter of 2024 than in the previous quarter, EVs had a lower share of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) market in Q3. Their share dropped from 7.4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3. Still, sales and market share are both up over Q3 2023.
The overall share of electrified vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids and EVs) increased ilast quarter, helped by the surge in popularity of non-plug-in hybrids, which made up 10.8% of the entire U.S. LDV market. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says this is a new record.
Tesla still holds nearly half of the market (48.8%), followed by General Motors, Hyundai and Ford. The EIA also quotes information from Wards Intelligence, which says 78.9% of all EVs bought in the U.S. in Q3 were made in North America, 7.3% came from South Korea, and 5.3% were German-made.
EIA sales
This huge share of American-made EVs is a direct result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which changed the requirements for EVs to qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit. Before, most EVs sold in the U.S. qualified for the full credit. But the requirements were tightened for 2024, making the list of eligible EVs much shorter (and it could get even shorter). They now have to be made in the U.S., with battery components and minerals sourced only from certain places—they can’t come from China, for instance. Of course, all of these restrictions do not apply to vehicles that are leased due to a loophole in the legislation.
Most EVs purchased in Q3 (70.7%) were luxury models, which is still a lot, but the EIA says it’s the lowest level recorded since Q2 2017. That's because the data considers Tesla a luxury manufacturer, and the company still accounts for around half of all EVs sold. Plus, there's an acute lack of affordable EVs in the U.S., so the average price of a new EV before incentives in Q3 was $56,351, or 16% higher than the national average.
If we just look at sales numbers, more EVs were delivered in the U.S. this year than in 2023. Over 346,000 EVs were sold through the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 5% over 2023. EVs accounted for 8.9% of all new cars sold, an increase from 7.8% last year.
Ford is in fourth place for the number of EVs sold this year in America, but it could be picking up the pace after a record-breaking November when sales amounted to 11,000 units (21% up year-over-year). It was actually second behind Tesla last month, although one good month alone wasn’t enough to move it into the top three.
Here's More About EV Sales
Honda also had strong sales toward the end of the year, selling more than 6,800 Prologues in November, marking a 66% rise over October. The GM-built Prologue sold over 25,000 units from January through November, placing it among the country’s top five best-selling EVs.
Some automakers seem to have caught some extra sales wind as the year draws to a close. It will be interesting to see the end-of-year data, given that this was widely regarded as a year when EV sales cooled, mainly affected by high prices and the stricter federal tax credit rules. With a new president who is less friendly toward EVs and foreign imports than his predecessor, 2025 will also be one to watch out for on the EV scene.",Andrei Nedelea
This Tiny Electric Pickup Has A Not-So-Tiny Price Tag,https://insideevs.com/news/743532/telo-mt1-pricing-announced/,"The pint-sized Telo EV starts at $41,520 and can reach almost $50,000 in dual-motor long-range guise.",12/6/2024 14:00,"There aren’t enough small electric pickups in America, but California-based Telo wants to change that. Its adorable MT1 measures just 152 inches in total length, or about the same size as a subcompact car, but it promises serious performance and range for such a small package, which is why it’s not cheap.
Telo just launched a configurator for its pickup, starting at $41,520. For that, you get it with a single 300-horsepower motor that powers the rear wheels. Its standard battery pack provides a claimed 260 miles of range. Upgrade to the long-range pack with 106 kilowatt-hours for $3,980 to increase the range to 350 miles.
If you want a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration, that pushes the starting price to $46,019, but it increases the combined power output to 500 hp. This variant accelerates to 60 mph (96 km/h) from a standstill in 4 seconds, and its top speed is 125 mph (201 km/h).
Fast charging can add 210 miles of range in 20 minutes in vehicles equipped with the large battery. The manufacturer hasn’t shared any additional charging details yet other than the fact that it will come with a standard NACS port.
Even though the MT1 has the footprint of a Mini Cooper SE, it has a crew cab capable of seating five, and its 60-inch bed is longer than that of a Rivian R1T, and it matches a Toyota Tacoma. It also has a removable midgate that extends the bed into the cab.
With the midgate out, you can add a third row of seats, which you can leave out and open to the elements, or you can close off the bed area, essentially turning the MT1 into a small van. The bed also has a lockable tonneau cover, so you can use it like the trunk of a normal car.
With a payload capacity of 1,600 pounds and the ability to tow up to 6,600 pounds, the MT1 shouldn’t have a problem performing as a small work truck. Its layout, somewhere between a traditional truck with a long hood and a cab-forward design, helps with its compactness, maneuverability in tight places and forward visibility.
Telo says it has over 3,700 reservations for the MT1, and you can pre-order yours with a $152 deposit. The order book is, therefore, not officially open yet, and the company says it may still adjust the pricing. Production is planned to start next year, with the first 500 units being hand-built. If it enters production as planned, it will be the smallest new pickup on the market and it will compete with trucks like the larger Ford Maverick hybrid, which is considerably cheaper.

Tesla Robotaxi Will Have 50% Fewer Parts Than Model 3,https://insideevs.com/news/743506/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-half-parts/,"That's one way to get the price below $30,000.",12/6/2024 13:00,"Tesla's Robotaxi concept is all about doing more with less. Whether that be parts, humans behind the wheel, or dollars spent on the car itself—the goal is to strip down the car as much as possible to drive down the cost of production.
Tesla has gotten very good at this, as it revealed at the first stop on a public showing tour of the Robotaxi at its flagship showroom at Santana Row in San Jose, California. During a discussion with the principal engineer of the Robotaxi project, it was revealed that engineers have managed to cut the number of parts in the Cybercab prototype down to just half of what's found in the production version of the Tesla Model 3 today.
""Two seats unlocks a lot of opportunity aerodynamically,"" said Eric, Tesla's lead engineer on the Robotaxi project. ""It also means we cut the part count of Cybercab down by a substantial margin. We're going to be delivering a car that has roughly half the parts of Model 3 today.""
The most obvious cost-cutting method is ditching that pesky steering wheel and pedals. Who needs those in a car that's supposed to drive itself, anyway? And while we're at it, let's just remove the entire rear seat assembly (and the two doors for the rear passengers). But there are also smaller changes, like only featuring three physical switches: two on the center console—the purpose of which has been argued to be either for the windows or doors—and one for the dome light.
Another example is the roof, which you'll notice is metal rather than glass. Folks on Twitter who were at the event say that while the metal roof may be cheaper and easier to unpack in Tesla's new ""unboxing"" production method, a Tesla engineer reportedly revealed that it proved to be quieter as well.
And perhaps one of the most behind-the-scenes ways that Tesla saved on parts count is the vehicle structure. According to a user on X who attended the event, the Robotaxi reportedly has just 80 parts in the body structure compared to the current Model Y's 200. Couple that with the car only supporting wireless charging and you'll quickly start to see how all of these tiny corner-cuts add up.
""This product is meant to be of extreme efficiency and we work really hard to deliver that. The efficiency isn't just on energy consumption-based, it's on the concept of cleaning,"" Tesla's engineer continued. ""It's also on the concept of reliability and service as well.""
The mantra behind Tesla's cybercab isn't the same as Colin Chapman's old adage ""simplify, then add lightness”—it's ""simplify for the sake of simplifying.""
Think of all the potential benefits of fewer parts: lower production cost, ease of repair, and greater reliability. Tesla is really flexing its production and engineering know-how with the Robotaxi project; a subtle brag and explanation of how Tesla projects that it can price the car under $30,000 without racing the rest of the world to the bottom. Now let's see them apply that same logic to solving panel gaps and alignment issues on existing new cars.
Of course, all this is for naught if Tesla can't solve self-driving. While its latest FSD v13 release is said to bring some major advancements, it still isn't perfect. If it wants to keep its ambitious Robotaxi release timeline of 2026, the automaker needs to fix a lot of edge-case scenarios very quickly. And that's something it's been trying to do since CEO Elon Musk first promised a fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive in 2016.

The VinFast VF6 Heads To Europe. It Could Undercut Chinese EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743519/vinfast-vf6-european-sales-announcement/,"Vinfast sees the VF6 as an important car to ""democratize EVs"" by making them smaller and more affordable.",12/6/2024 12:00,"Y’know, kudos to VinFast. Despite having one of the worst-reviewed cars in recent memory, which led to the Vietnamese startup having some of the slowest-selling models on the market, it hasn’t given up on its electric vehicle plans. The VF8 has gone through some improvements, which supposedly has made it tolerable to use. Its once missing-in-action VF9 three-row crossover is finally making its way to U.S. dealerships.
Similarly, VinFast just announced that its Chevy Bolt-sized VinFast VF6 is headed to Europe. This product announcement is a little more important than just yet another weird brand selling another small EV in Europe. VinFast wants this car to democratize EVs, and it thinks the VF6 could be a tool to get Europeans behind the wheel of reasonably priced EVs.
VInfast VF6 Europe
We really don’t know too much about the VF6 just yet, though. It was initially shown off as a preproduction concept about three years ago, but it looks like VinFast has stayed fairly close to that model. And yes, the VF6 is a real car; it’s been on Vietnamese roads for the past few months, rolling around in the hands of Vietnamese customers.
There are already a handful of Vietnamese-language videos and articles reviewing the VF6, but no media has really got their hands on the car outside of Vietnam.
Mechanically, the VF6 will be powered by a 201-horsepower motor powering the front wheels. The VF6’s 59.6 kWh LFP battery is good for 254 miles of range, based on the WLTP cycle. The car’s guts seem semi sophisticated though, since it uses a fully independent multi-link rear suspension rather than a semi-independent torsion beam commonly found on other cheap small EVs.
It's interesting to note that in the press release the brand sent over, VinFast harped on EV affordability. It quoted Boston Consulting Group, saying that ""the democratization of EVs depends on their ability to build an affordable B-segment for the European market.” It also said that 27% of all European cars are in this B-segment (subcompact), yet the electric offerings there are slim.
Currently, the VF6 is already open for reservations in France, Germany and The Netherlands, starting at just shy of $36,000 (33,900€). It wouldn’t be the cheapest EV in the segment, though. Cars like the Leapmotor T03 or Dacia Spring undercut the VF6 by a huge margin, but they’re much smaller cars with a lot less power and range. The new Ford Puma Gen-E is the same size class as VinFast’s VF6, and it is only slightly more expensive. But its 233-mile range means it can’t go as far. Could VinFast have a right-priced, right-sized hit on its hands here?
Vinfast VF6 at the 2022 Paris Motor Show
Maybe so. The VinFast VF6 could end up being a stealth hit in Europe for one reason: it is Vietnamese. Therefore, it’s not subject to double-digit anti-Chinese tariffs the EU has leveled against imported electric vehicles from China. Similarly, I think the VF6 could also be a surprise hit here in America. The VF6 (and VF7) genuinely appear to be better-executed products than the VF8. These products would be cheap, which should mean that buyers would be more willing to overlook a product’s shortcomings since it wouldn’t cost too much to buy.
I remain cautiously optimistic. If VinFast can keep its quality in check, and deliver a satisfying driving experience,  then the brand may have a future after all.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping up the future of driving and clean transportation.
Also on our radar today: As Google's robotaxi service Waymo plans to expand to two new cities, the cars are witnessing more instances of vandalism. What is provoking these attacks? Plus, Volkswagen workers are embarking on a prolonged strike as the automaker prepares for historic plant closures in Europe.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk walked into Capitol Hill yesterday wearing a black suit and a blue tie, with his four-year-old son X Æ A-12 perched on his shoulders. As he walked into the session, reporters swarmed around him and asked questions about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk didn't respond but reacted with a disapproving side-eye.
After meeting with government officials, though, he did respond. He reiterated that the government should ""get rid of all credits."" Musk has taken on a new role as head of DOGE, an internet meme-turned-advisory body in the incoming Trump administration that will propose ways to reduce annual federal spending and streamline regulations for autonomous vehicles.
But right now, Tesla needs the credits to meet its sales goals for the year, Automotive News reports. You can lease a Tesla Model 3 or Model Y for relatively cheap. Tesla is even offering 0% financing for up to 60 months on orders placed by December 15 and those delivered by December 30. There's even a $0 downpayment financing option available—with the point-of-sale federal tax credit serving as the downpayment for qualifying buyers.
It signals that Tesla needs the federal tax credits as much as any other automaker. Musk said in October that the automaker would beat last year's 1.8 million global deliveries. After a rough couple of quarters in the start of 2024, that doesn't seem to be the case. Now, Tesla is banking on holiday lease deals and offers to get closer to that figure.
Here's more from Automotive News:
Tesla’s leasing push comes after CEO Elon Musk said in October that the automaker would beat last year’s 1.8 million global deliveries. Through the first three quarters this year, global sales fell 2.3 percent, Tesla said. In the U.S., registration data showed Tesla down 7.3 percent in the same period.
Tesla’s monthly lease penetration has fluctuated over the last two years, but the trend has been toward sharply higher rates, S&P Global Mobility said.
In January 2023, Tesla’s U.S. lease penetration was 8 percent but rose to 20 percent in December last year, the data showed. This year, Tesla’s highest lease penetration was in April at 31 percent before falling to 22 percent in July and 15 percent in September, the most recent month available, S&P Global Mobility said.
It's not just the consumer credits that help Tesla. The automaker also hugely relies on some of the Biden administration's other EV policies, like the regulatory credit scheme and even funding for EV charging. So far this year, Tesla has earned over $2.1 billion selling regulatory credits to automakers that haven't reached their emissions targets. Over 40% of Tesla's profits this year came from regulatory credit sales.
Now that other automakers are also benefitting from some of these policies, Musk wants them gone altogether? I'm no arbiter of such matters, but that doesn't sound fair.
Google parent company Alphabet's robotaxi service Waymo is operational in four U.S. cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin. These are self-driving Jaguar I-Pace electric crossovers that ferry passengers around town.
Waymo is now planning to expand to Atlanta and Miami as well. But it has to figure out how to deal with vandalism first. Social media is filled with videos of angry mobs smashing Waymos in San Francisco, lighting them up on fire and breaking their windshields. But why are people angry?
Here's an answer to that from Bloomberg:
In some sense, smashing a Waymo’s window is the latest instance in a long tradition of attacking new technology — in the style of textile-machine-smashing Luddites. In a more recent analog, protesters upset about gentrification in San Francisco in 2013 and 2014 staged elaborate stunts to blockade Google employee shuttle buses. They danced in front of them in clown suits, broke a window and in one case apparently vomited on a Yahoo bus.
Some of the rage against self-driving machines may have an obvious cause. Autonomous cars have created annoyances — endless midnight honking — and been involved in serious crashes. They also symbolize a very real threat of job displacement. And Waymos have been dealing with vandalism for years: During early testing in Arizona in 2018, people damaged the cars with knives and rocks.
Waymos are equipped with expensive lidars and a suite of cameras and sensors that help the vehicles navigate urban settings. According to Waymo's former CEO, each vehicle costs between $130,000 and $150,000. For companies aiming to mass deploy robotaxis, including Tesla and General Motors' Cruise, it looks like they may have to first figure out how to build public trust and confidence.
In case of miscreants—like some in the videos linked above seem to be—there will have to be a system in place to prevent them from harming these cars. Because that's not just a threat to the cars, but it could also be dangerous for the passengers riding in them.
Volkswagen workers in Germany will go on an extended strike next week. The German automaker is planning historic plant closures in Europe along with mass layoffs as it aims to navigate the high costs of electrification and fierce foreign competition.
The nation's largest IG Metall union representing Volkswagen workers said strikes will be in effect at nine different locations starting Monday.
""It borders on mockery when Oliver Blume stands in front of the workforce and wishes them a Merry Christmas, while at the same time, the VW board would prefer to put letters of termination under the Christmas tree for the employees,"" IG Metall negotiator Thorsten Groeger said as per a Reuters report.
The strike will coincide with the next round of discussions between the Volkswagen Group management and labor representatives as they hope to manage costs while also protecting the manufacturing jobs, which are critical to Germany's economy, especially in the auto sector.
Tesla benefitted from billions in federal funding to sustain and grow its EV and charging businesses. Now, its competitors are also taking advantage of the Biden administration's consumer and manufacturing incentives to accelerate EV adoption. Musk himself supports industry-wide electrification. “Invest in electric vehicles,"" he said in 2015. ""You won't regret it.""
Is it fair that he wants the subsidies gone after benefitting from them for years? And does playing fair even matter anymore? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Six EV SUVs Were Driven Until They Died. The Winner Was Clear,https://insideevs.com/news/743442/ev-range-test-carwow-suv/,"Mat Watson of CarWow pushed crossovers from Porsche, Polestar, Ford, Tesla, Audi and Kia to their limits.",12/6/2024 10:00,"We here at InsideEVs live for electric vehicle range tests, whether they’re our own evaluations or ones done by other intrepid outlets. And we know you, dear reader, love this stuff as much as we do.
In the real world, practically nobody will actually run their EV down to a 0% state of charge. You’d have to be looking for trouble to do that. But it’s fascinating to learn which models actually live up to their advertised range estimates—and which can drive the farthest when push comes to shove.
Mat Watson, of the CarWow YouTube channel, pushed six electric SUVs to their limits in a recent video, and the results are fascinating. He and his team drove the EVs across the United Kingdom until they wouldn’t go another inch. It’s so rare to pit several cars against one another under identical circumstances—the same weather, same route, same day—making this test a real treat.
Here are the contenders CarWow tested:
Let’s get something out of the way upfront. CarWow is a British channel, so all the vehicles are European-spec. And all the range estimates quoted are according to Europe’s testing standards, which are more generous than the EPA figures we’re used to in the States.
Still, we think this test is enlightening for American buyers, since most of the vehicles are available in the U.S. The Ford Explorer EV—based on the same Volkswagen platform as that brand’s ID.4—is the only one that isn’t. (America's Explorer is bigger and gas-powered.)
The European-market Ford Explorer EV.
For the range test, the CarWow team charged each SUV up to 100% and set off. They drove at the posted speed limit with the climate control set to 68 degrees, only slowing down to maximize range once the vehicle’s state of charge reached an alarmingly low level. So, basically, they tried to act like a normal driver probably would.
For all the details and a deeper dive on each vehicle, check out CarWow’s 50-minute video. Or keep reading for the results and our take on them. First, check out the final numbers, along with each vehicle's battery size and range as provided by CarWow. CarWow says it tested the longest-range version of each car, which suggests they're all the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive variants. So it's a level playing field on that front.
It’s not a shocker that no vehicle matched its range rating, since the test was done at highway speeds and that sucks more energy than city driving. Plus, few cars will ever hit their WLTP figures because that cycle is so generous. The Polestar 4—a strange Chinese crossover with no rear window—blew away the competition in terms of absolute miles driven and the percentage of its range rating it achieved. A whopping 333 miles is an excellent result, as is delivering 90% of its WLTP range.
The Porsche Macan came in second, driving nearly as far. And the two top spots make perfect sense, given that the Polestar and Porsche pack the largest battery packs at 94 kilowatt-hours and 95 kWh, respectively. Those are some beefy batteries.
Despite being the oldest and arguably stalest of the bunch, the Model Y held its own quite nicely, traveling nearly 300 miles and claiming third. That’s despite having the smallest battery pack at 75 kWh. So, just because Tesla hasn’t updated the Model Y since it came out, don’t count it out; Elon Musk’s company still makes some highly competitive and efficient cars.
2024 Porsche Macan EV.
Interestingly enough, the Ford Explorer matched the Model Y almost exactly in range and tied it in efficiency. Plus, it looks pretty darn cool. (Hey, Ford, maybe you should bring that thing to America? Think about it.)
Speaking of, what these range tests often underscore is just how absolutely crucial EV efficiency is. Big range numbers are great. But you know what’s even better? Lots of range from a modest battery pack. That’ll save you money on upfront cost, reduce energy costs over the long term and reduce your carbon footprint too.
This SUV test also highlights how much more efficient sedans are, thanks to their lower weights and slipperier shapes. CarWow did a similar test with six sedans earlier this year, and the results were way better pretty much across the board.
Tesla Model 3 Performance.
The Tesla Model 3, equipped with a 75-kWh pack, went 352 miles and notched an efficiency of 4.7 mi/kWh. The Mercedes-Benz EQE traveled a bladder-busting 357 miles. Of course, this may have had to do with the weather or road conditions on that particular day, but the body style surely has something to do with it too.
What cars do you want us to range-test in the future? Any other tests you want to see? Let us know in the comments below.

Ola’s Swappable Batteries Are The Future Of Urban Mobility,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743058/ola-electric-scooters-swappable-batteries/,"Practically speaking, this is the best path forward for two-wheeled electric urban mobility.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of experiencing what the future of urban mobility could look like while testing Can-Am's new Pulse and Origin. As fun as these bikes were, I'm not sure how I'd get on living with one, considering their conventional charging systems. Like most people who live in a city, I reside in an apartment, and charging outlets are limited.
So, although urban environments are the places where electric motorcycles with limited ranges make the most sense, for many people, they're completely unfeasible because they have nowhere to charge them.
Enter Ola Electric's new electric scooter range with swappable batteries that you can recharge inside your apartment. The all-new range consists of the Gig and the Gig+.
The base model Gig has drum brakes and is driven by a 250-watt electric motor, making it exempt from registration requirements in certain parts of the world. Unfortunately, this means it only has a top speed of around 15 mph, meaning this is realistically only an alternative for those using electric kick scooters. But there's one key difference—Range.
The single, swappable 1.5 kWh battery pack in the Gig gives it a 69-mile range, while none of the regular electric kick scooters will achieve anything close to that.
The Gig+ also stops with drum brakes but is for those who want to travel further and faster. Its 1.5 kW hub motor gives it a top speed of 28 mph, and it features a dual-battery setup. Ola claims that the Gig+ has a 50-mile range when using a single battery pack or a 97-mile range with the dual battery setup.
This isn't the first time we've seen electric motorcycles with swappable batteries, but it was an exciting concept when it was first introduced, and now that we see it catching on, it's hard to see affordable electric two-wheeled urban mobility going any other way. But there's still an issue, at least with these models.
If these scooters are to make waves in major cities across Europe and the US, they'll need to have considerably faster top speeds. As of now, Ola Electric models aren't available in the US, but here's hoping that they'll arrive soon with higher speeds.
Deliveries of the Gig and Gig+ will begin in India in April 2025.

‘Game Changer’: Honda Solid-State EVs With 620 Miles Of Range Coming This Decade,https://insideevs.com/news/743468/honda-solid-state-ev-620-miles/,"Honda claims its future EVs will even go as far as 776 miles on a full charge after 2040. There is one big issue, though.",12/6/2024 4:08,"Honda is kicking its solid-state battery efforts into high gear. The Japanese automaker claims the first electric vehicles fitted with its latest-gen packs would be capable of driving up to 620 miles on a full charge by the end of this decade. That's roughly double the range of today's mass-market EVs.
Besides making range anxiety a non-issue, the new solid-state batteries developed by Honda will be 50% smaller, 35% lighter and 25% cheaper to manufacture than current liquid-based lithium-ion cells. The solid electrolyte cells also promise to be much safer than what is readily available on the market today, as well as accept much higher charging speeds.
After 2040, the goals are even more ambitious. That range figure will be pushed even further to 776 miles, while the size, weight and cost will be even smaller.
More Solid-State Battery Stories
The carmaker’s executives laid all of this out during a briefing late last month in Japan. The presentation came a week after Honda announced it built a pilot production facility where it will try to figure out how to make solid-state batteries sustainably and at a mass scale. Test production will begin next month.
It all sounds excellent, and it’s undeniable that progress will be made, but Honda execs didn’t hold back on significant roadblocks that still lie ahead. The biggest issue is that the prototype battery cells the automaker is experimenting with are tiny and can’t be used in any vehicle–100 times too small, in fact.
“That’s why we have created the pilot line to identify and deal with any issues in terms of size and mass production as soon as possible,” said Takeshi Ueda, chief engineer of innovative research excellence at Honda R&D. “We have to make our prototype battery 100 times bigger. We are working on how to bring them to the mass production phase.”
Other issues are related to the production process. The ceramic separators can crack and dendrites can form in the putty-like electrolyte which can lead to a short-circuit. There’s also a climate control problem–the humidity in the facility has to be low, which usually means huge equipment that needs massive amounts of energy.
But Honda seems confident it can surpass these hurdles. For pressing the electrolyte in an even and ultracompact layer, it chose a roll-pressing technique that it says achieves thin films at fast speeds. The electrolyte slurry will be made using a continuous mixing method, which is allegedly three times faster than the batch process mixing used for conventional lithium-ion cells. To keep the humidity low, Honda chose to encapsulate each production process in its own climate-controlled area, which should help keep energy costs down because there’s no need to warm or cool a vast volume of air in a single room.
“Our all-solid-state battery will be a game changer in this EV era,” said Keiji Otsu, president of Honda R&D Co.
Honda is just one of the big players trying to turn the solid-state battery dream into reality. Toyota, Nissan, Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen all work toward the same goal, either on their own or through partnerships with third-party companies.",Iulian Dnistran
The Nissan Ariya Needs An Extra Plastic Piece To Use Tesla Superchargers (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/743323/nissan-ariya-nacs-adapter-plastic-piece/,It comes in the adapter box and stays in the charge port forever.,12/6/2024 2:04,"Updated with statements from Nissan.
Nissan Ariya EV owners in the United States will get access to roughly 17,800 Tesla Supercharger DC fast chargers next Tuesday. That’s a pretty big deal, and it comes as an addition to the Electrify America, the Shell Recharge branded network, ChargePoint and EVgo networks that Nissan Ariya owners in the U.S. already had access to via MyNISSAN smartphone app.
The Japanese electric crossover is just the latest to join the growing list of EVs that can use Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is widely considered one of the best in the business–if not the best.
However, what sets Nissan apart from all the other automakers that have inked deals with Tesla for Supercharger access is the design of the Ariya’s charge port. Because of the negative space between the two DC pins at the bottom of the port, Ariya owners will need to install a black piece of plastic before using an NACS to CCS adapter.
More EV Charging Stories
The T-shaped plastic bit is included in the $235 adapter box sold by Nissan, as noticed by The Verge, and owners can install it by hand and forget about it. In a statement sent to InsideEVs, Nissan said the ""adapter kit enables activation of the locking mechanism on a Tesla Supercharger to CCS port during a charging session. The plug adapter does not affect the overall functionality of the port, nor does it interfere with charging at a CCS station.""
Here’s what the Nissan Ariya’s CCS port looks like. Notice the hollow space between the two DC pins at the bottom. Next to it is the NACS to CCS adapter sold by Nissan.
The U.S.-spec Nissan Ariya has the charging port on the front-right.

And here’s what the CCS ports of the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning look like. Notice how the DC pins are separated by a solid piece of plastic.

Ford F-150 Lightning charge port
You can see how the whole thing works in Nissan’s explainer video below.
The adapter sold by Nissan looks identical to the one offered by Rivian, Ford and General Motors, but the extra plastic piece is only included in the Nissan box. Interestingly, the Ariya sold in the United Kingdom and Australia has a different design of the CCS port–it’s CCS2 instead of CCS1, but the DC pins at the bottom don’t have a hollow space between them, just a solid piece of plastic. On these right-hand drive units, the charge port is also on the left side of the vehicle, whereas U.S.-spec models have the port on the right.
The Japanese automaker added that the Ariya's CCS1 port ""was designed with a void in this area due to a different manufacturing process. However, Nissan took the additional step to modify the charge port to ensure that current Ariya customers have access to the Tesla Supercharger network.""
It’s intriguing, to say the least. What’s your take on this?",Iulian Dnistran
Battery-Swapping Nio Has Big Plans. Maybe Even For America,https://insideevs.com/news/743422/nio-usa-launch-interview/,"China's Nio plans on entering 25 more markets by the end of 2025, and it’s considering partnerships too. What about the U.S.?",12/5/2024 14:55,"Political pundits may denounce the presence of Chinese electric vehicles on American roads, but the fact is that they’ve already kind of been here, quietly running in the background for more than a little while now. I’m talking more substantially than say, Ford’s CEO driving a Xiaomi SU7 around the Chicagoland area, or the handful of Mexican tourists driving around South Texas their Baojuns that have been rebadged as Chevrolet products.
No, these brands have been in the U.S. in an official capacity, with offices and employees. BYD has a Pasadena, California office; it’s the place where you’ve likely seen your favorite YouTubers and TikTokers pawing through a handful of its China-only models it’s imported over for business duties. The Chinese giant has quietly moved metal in the U.S. before, like a fleet-only version of its e6 EV crossover. It’s been building and selling electric buses in the U.S. for more than a decade now. Given how much of the globe’s tech comes out of the United States, it’s kind of a no-brainer that tech-heavy Chinese EV brands would have some sort of presence here, especially in Silicon Valley.
That includes Nio, who was the subject of my most recent trip to China. The brand has had a San Jose office since at least 2015 with an on-again, off-again plan to actually sell cars in the United States.
2025 Nio ET9
When you look at Nio’s lineup in China and Europe, it seems like a no-brainer. They feel like the kinds of electric cars we’d want to buy.  Nio’s product line has more than doubled from three different models in 2018 to eight in 2024 (including a new more modestly-priced mainstream sub-brand called Onvo), with plans to launch an even cheaper mainstream brand by the end of this year.
Nio Power Swap Station
As of right now, Nio and Onvo have a range of crossovers and sedans meant to attract buyers of both mainstream and luxury EV buyers. And its signature battery-swapping technology seems like a surefire way to ease the range and charging anxiety that keeps many people from going electric.
These moves seem to have paid off. The company has grown, from about 8,000 units moved in its first year of 2018, to 190,000 units and counting for 2024. Why not grow into America next?
2023 Nio EL6 exterior front three-quarter view driving
But a world of EV development and huge geopolitical shifts have happened since Nio first opened that California office Sure, the U.S. market is arguably more ready than ever for another EV player, and Nio’s product line could be just what we’re looking for. But that’s all underscored by the fact that U.S.-China relations are at an all-time low, and just might get worse. Given the recent antagonism and shifting tide against China, are they even considering a U.S. launch anymore?
Despite it all, the answer is a definite maybe. Nio hasn’t quite counted the United States off its to-do list, but they were very clear: it probably won’t be for a while.
Like other Chinese EV manufacturers, Nio’s desire for growth, both inside and outside of China, is crucial to its survival. Thus, the brand has taken steps to grow its numbers in part by introducing new models.
But, it’s got to keep growing. Nio says that it will continue to push through Europe and other parts of Asia. “Nio will firmly explore the global markets, aiming to enter 25 countries and regions by the end of 2025, meet local user needs in different markets with its three brands and price segments, and adopt a global market strategy tailored to local conditions,” a Nio representative said in an email when asked about the brand’s future expansion plans. Ambitious, but expansion isn’t easy. Neither are the geopolitics that must be navigated or the questions surrounding sales, service, marketing and more.
Curiously, Nio also said that “[Nio] will continue to steadily implement its globalization strategy, work with partners to help facilitate technological innovation in the global smart electric vehicle industry, and provide innovative technologies, products, and services to users in more countries and regions.” The standout word in that sentence is partners.
Nio ET9 (2025)
Let’s look at its most recent market that it’s entered: Azerbaijan. Instead of entering that market itself feet first, it partnered with a distributor called Green Car to manage its sales, service, battery swap stations, and customer lounge centers, called Nio Houses. This steps around its original direct-to-consumer sales model, allowing a third party to run and manage things The partnership with Green Car is considered the start of Nio’s new strategy of entering international markets.
Nio isn’t the only brand that’s looked to outside partners to expand outside of China. Famously, Leapmotor has partnered with Stellantis as a method of entering European markets easier. The EU has recently floated the idea of a sort of reverse joint-venture relationship, where Chinese automakers partner with European ones to circumvent any import tariffs associated with Chinese EV imports.
So, what does that mean for us? Could Nio be pointing toward moving towards a partnership to enter the U.S.? Nio’s representatives sent over this statement: “The United States is one of the largest car markets in the world, and major automotive manufacturers have a strong presence there. NIO has established the team in the U.S. since the beginning of the company and has been evaluating the optimal time and strategy for its entry to the U.S. market.”
It’s not clear what form a U.S. Nio launch would take, but these are interesting statements from an interesting company, during a very interesting time in both the EV revolution and the U.S.-China relationship.

Chevrolet Equinox EV: How Much Does It Cost To Charge It?,https://insideevs.com/news/743378/chevy-equinox-ev-charging-costs/,"It costs less than half as much to ""fuel"" per mile compared to the gas-powered Equinox.",12/5/2024 13:00,"Chevrolet hit a home run with the Equinox EV, providing perhaps the ultimate range per dollar value on the EV market. The FWD version offers a substantial 319 miles of EV range. With the new LT trim hitting dealers, the Equinox EV FWD starts at just $33,600 — before the potential federal tax credit.
Another crucial part of the Equinox EV value equation is the fuel savings from not paying for gas. Calculating that is trickier than rattling off an EPA number. How much does it cost to charge a Chevrolet Equinox EV? The short answer is that it depends on how, where, and when you charge.
More Charging Costs
There’s one basic way to fill up a combustion car: insert a nozzle from a fuel pump. The cost is more or less the same, with some variation between stations. There are many ways to charge the battery on a Chevrolet Equinox EV, with some methods proving markedly more expensive than others. But we can use some broad numbers to get a rough baseline of how much it costs to charge an Equinox EV.
The Chevrolet Equinox EV packs 85 kWh of usable battery capacity. The national average household electricity rate is currently 16.83 cents/kWh. Charging from empty to 100 percent would cost $14.31 at that rate. A more typical 10-80% charge would cost about $10.01.
Home electricity rates vary between states. Rates vary further within states; more densely populated areas tend to have cheaper electricity. Charging an Equinox EV at home on a Level 2 charger should be the most affordable option wherever an owner resides.
How affordable charging at home is depends heavily on location. In Louisiana, with an average rate of 11.93 cents/kWh, a 10-80% charge for an Equinox EV would cost $7.10. In Connecticut, with an average rate of 33.01 cents/kWh, the same 10-80% charge would cost $19.64. Local utility companies may offer reduced metered rates for off-peak EV charging.
For many buyers, a Chevrolet Equinox EV may be their first EV. So, it’s worth noting that the installation cost for a Level 2 home charger can erode some of the savings. A popular charger like the Chargepoint Home Flex can cost more than $500. Installation by a professional electrician can cost thousands of dollars.
The Chevrolet Equinox EV is capable of 150 kW fast charging. A Level 3 DC fast charger will be the quickest, most convenient way to charge while on the road. But in most cases, it will also be a lot more expensive than charging at home — potentially more than twice the going rate for electricity during peak hours.
The Equinox EV can charge at Tesla Superchargers with a $225 adapter. Motortrend provides a rough estimate of 25-50 cents/kWh. At that rate, an Equinox EV owner would expect to pay between $14.87 and $29.75 for a full 10-80% charge. Tesla can also charge up to $1.00 per minute in idling and congestion fees.
That rate should be similar to other DC fast chargers. My closest fast charging option, an EVgo charger, averages a little above 50 cents/kWh with taxes and fees during peak daytime charging.
The Equinox EV is built on GM’s dedicated EV platform. So, there is not a true like-for-like analog in the combustion realm. But for a rough measure, we can use the the Chevy Equinox combustion crossover. According to the EPA, the Chevy Equinox FWD earns 28 mpg combined. It requires 3.6 gallons of fuel to travel 100 miles. The EPA estimates the Equinox EV FWD needs 31 kWh to travel 100 miles.
As of this writing, the national average price for a gallon of gas is $3.04. At that rate, driving an Equinox FWD 100 miles costs $10.94. At the national household electricity rate of 16.38 cents/kWh, it would cost $5.21 to drive an Equinox EV — less than half as much. But that price could jump to between $7.75 and $15.50 if charging an Equinox EV via DC fast charging, approaching or even exceeding the cost of gasoline.",Ty Duffy
"EV Dirt Bike Brand Niu Won't Make You Endure A Dealership, Thank God",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742944/niu-electric-dirt-bike-xqi3-direct-to-consumer-dealership/,"Good, because haggling is my least favorite thing to do.",12/25/2024 1:25,"I really loved my time with NIU's XQi3. In fact, my kids were pretty saddened when it was time for the street-legal electric dirt bike to go back to the company. I'm pretty sure one actually cried while saying, ""No more wheelies!""
But despite the favorable review I gave it, as well as the testimonial my children relayed, I found one aspect of NIU's world domination plan to be suspect: the EVs were sold through existing dealerships, not directly to consumers.
Now, I get the reasoning behind doing it that way, as dealerships get foot traffic and the lower-than-average selling price of the XQi3s likely would attract potential customer eyeballs and cash. But dealerships, even powersport dealerships who've been slightly better in terms of adapting to the EV way of the future, aren't always the best place to sell EVs. Likewise, I and countless others have never had what I'd call a ""good"" dealership experience. Doesn't matter if it's me buying a car, truck, or powersport thing, there's always an air of ""I'm gonna somehow screw you"" coming from the salesperson in front of me.
And most folks agree with that sentiment, as a 2016 study found that 87% of consumers particularly dislike the dealership experience.
That's why when NIU stated the company would start selling its offerings directly to consumers, as well as keep its traditional dealership partners, I was pretty stoked about its future.
According to the company, customers can now purchase an XQi3 through the NIU Moto Sales Platform (NMSP) across the US, allowing them to ""shop, finance and finalize their XQi3 purchase entirely online."" From there, the NMSP does all the tax, title, and registering (for those wishing to make their bikes street-legal), as well as offering up financing options, too. Niu states that ""Once purchased, the dirt bikes are shipped directly to customers or to a nearby dealer for final assembly and delivery.""
So there's still a dealership network available to you for maintenance and repair, you just don't have to use them to purchase your motorcycle.
""The launch of the NIU Moto Sales Platform is a milestone not only for our company but for the EV industry as a whole,"" said Ben McGill, Niu's head of North America Operations, adding, ""E-commerce has transformed countless industries, and we believe it’s time for motor vehicles to embrace this innovation. Our platform ensures that no matter where you live, you can be part of the EV revolution—even if local retailers and dealers haven’t yet adapted to this shift.""
For those who do like to haggle, NIU isn't giving up on its dealerships, though. The brand states that its growing dealership network, which now totals over 100, including its two flagship stores in San Diego and Miami, will ""[empower] dealers to expand their customer base while providing seamless access to NIU’s cutting-edge products.""
As for the bike in question, NIU recently slashed both of the prices for the XQi3 Wild and Street by $1,000, each commanding an incredibly reasonable $3,999. NIU also did an OTA update that apparently upgrades the bikes' performance pretty drastically, though I've yet to test it out—you've got my number, NIU. But overall, it's good news from NIU and good news for folks who loathe going to the dealership.

Ford EV Sales Reach New Monthly Record In November,https://insideevs.com/news/743395/ford-ev-sales-set-a-new-monthly-record/,Ford sold a record number of Mustang Mach-Es and F-150 Lightnings in November.,12/5/2024 12:00,"Ford sold a record number of electric vehicles in the third quarter. Now, it's carrying that momentum in the final quarter and is on track to finish the year strong for its EVs and hybrids.
The automaker's electrified vehicle sales, which includes hybrids, EVs and PHEVs, totaled 257,693 units in the first 11 months of this year. November EV sales stood at 10,821 units, a 21% increase compared to last November, thanks to relatively strong demand for the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit.
Customers drove 5,983 electric Mustangs home, marking its best-ever monthly sales, which also happens to be 39% more than the same period last year. Nearly 45,000 units of the Mustang Mach-E have been sold so far this year in the U.S. It only trails the Tesla Model Y, making it the second best-selling electric SUV in the first 11 months of 2024.
The Mach-E was introduced as a 2021 model year car. Despite being around for so long, it continues to bring home results for Ford.
For 2025, the electric crossover is an even better deal. The 2025 Mustang Mach-E will be among the cheapest crossovers on the market with a starting price of $36,495 before destination. It now gets new features like a heat pump for better battery efficiency and range in the winter and automatic lane changes on the latest BlueCruise version.
The E-Transit van has also been racking up record sales numbers. Ford said its sales volumes are already up four times this year compared to last year and it's America's best-selling electric van. So far this year, Ford has sold 11,584 E-Transits, whereas November sales reached 1,240 units.
While the F-150 Lightning may have conceded its best-selling electric truck crown to the Tesla Cybertruck in the third quarter, it continues to do well by its own measure. Ford sold a record 3,643 F-150 Lightnings in November, a 1.7% increase over last year. Through November, Ford sold 28,313 units of the electric truck, up 39% compared to the same period last year.
However, the sales figures of the fully electric models pale compared to the hybrids. The Maverick and F-150 hybrids continue to be volume sellers and profit drivers for the brand. The automaker has sold a whopping 133,983 hybrid trucks so far this year; that includes 67,666 F-150 hybrids and 66,272 Maverick hybrids.
All said competition is truly heating up in the EV space. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 now comes with a factory-fitted NACS port for seamless access to Tesla Superchargers. The Honda Prologue is quickly becoming one of America's favorite EVs and General Motors now offers the largest EV portfolio of all brands, with the Chevy Equinox EV spearheading that offensive.
Even though uncertainty looms over the discontinuation of the federal EV tax credits under the incoming Trump administration, one thing is clear: 2025 will bring consumers more choices and better EVs than ever before.

The EV Industry Is Gearing Up To Fight Donald Trump,https://insideevs.com/news/743292/trump-us-ev-industry-fight/,"Plus, Waymo's ridership has gone way, way up, and things are going very, very bad for GM in China.",12/5/2024 10:44,"The auto industry is at a weird place right now: after years of pushing back against tougher regulations driving electric vehicles, the car business in America has finally leaned in, only for the incoming presidential administration to potentially pull EV tax credits away. But the industry needs that money flowing to fund this transition, and now it's starting to fight back.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about the auto industry's plea to keep the EV tax credits, Waymo's way-up ridership, and GM's grim outlook for China. Let's jump in.
President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration has been clear about how they stand on EV subsidies: get rid of 'em. That means ditching the $7,500 tax credit, production credits for critical factories, and any federal mandates, existing or not. Never fear, though, because the industry believes that the EV revolution is here to stay whether or not these subsidies disappear—the question is just how effectively, efficiently, and quickly the market is penetrated by battery-powered cars.
That being said, the industry isn't going down without a fight. Automakers, battery manufacturers, and key component suppliers are gearing up to ensure that the transition continues at full steam, or at least as closely as it can given the circumstances.
If you recall, one of Trump's campaign promises was to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act on his first day in office, as well as cut any rules that force automakers to meet an electrified sales goal of two-thirds of their fleet by 2032. Since the election, Trump hasn't spoken publicly on this promise.
Recently, The Information asked the Trump campaign about the status of his plans: are those items still on the chopping block? According to a campaign spokesperson, the incoming president will “Support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars and electric vehicles""—which reads as an inconclusive nothing-burger that has industry lobbying groups like the Alliance for Automotive Innovation a bit riled up.
Shortly after the election, the Alliance's president and CEO, John Bozella, wrote to Trump, urging him to ""preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code"" as they relate to ""next-generation automotive technologies, including EVs."" And that kind of lobbying is about all the industry can do right about now, especially when the first day of the Trump presidency—when those cuts were promised—is coming up very quickly.
The Alliance has since hosted a conference in Washington D.C. In attendance were auto, battery, and mining executives who passively pleaded to retain the existing credit. In fact, the National Mining Association even stressed the need to increase the existing subsidies to include the mining industry, since many of the precious ingredients in an EV battery actually need to be mined and refined in order to be turned into those sweet, sweet batteries.
Industry players also recognized that, despite the credit being in effect, EV adoption has slowed. However, they also noted that the IRA has rapidly fueled domestic investments into manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs—$123 billion since 2018 (including $90 billion in battery factories and $33 billion in EV plants, according to the report from The Information).
So while the U.S. EV adoption rate still currently sits around 10%, it's growing fast. Companies have already made vast investments into growing the EV industry, but that doesn't mean that adoption will happen without continued support and regulation. It's one of the ways that China was able to reach the major threshold of half of its new car sales being electrified (either BEV or hybrid) earlier this year.
And if the U.S. kills EV subsidies, it risks falling even further behind China's EV industry during one of the most critical times in the transition.
Waymo's robotaxis are on quite the roll. After opening up paid rides to the general public just 90 days ago, the Alphabet-backed company more than doubled its number of passengers (also called ""ridership"") in California.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Waymo hit just a hair under a half-million passengers in August, up from 204,000 passengers in May 2024 and 292,000 in June. This means Waymo managed an uptick of a whopping 295,000 passengers since May—quite the feat for the driverless ride-hailing service. Those passengers managed to log a total of 312,000 paid rides, which is more than double the number achieved at the end of Q2 (May).
So why the sudden uptick? Well, that's hard to say. Even Waymo can't attribute the reasoning to one single event. However, the company's recent expansion into Los Angeles almost certainly helped pad the numbers. And to sprinkle some more success into the mix, Waymo has also been steadily increasing the number of vehicles on the road in California and other markets like Phoenix.
Some quick napkin math from data collected by the California Public Utilities Commission shows that Waymo had around 479 vehicles in service in August, which means that each car serviced around 651 rides per month. For those keeping up, that's about one ride every 55 or so minutes. Not too shabby.
Riders are also increasingly interested in driverless cars. Some people want to try them out for sheer curiosity—I mean, it's kind of cool to be in a car and have nobody behind the wheel, right? Other folks say that Waymo's rides are typically cost-competitive when compared with ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, though not always. However, some people are willing to pay a premium just to not have to make small talk with a stranger who just happens to be chauffeuring them around. The inner introvert in me loves that for them. Plus, there's no tipping a robot (yet.)
Of course, the ride has come with some bumps. Just like ridership is up, so are crashes. Waymo reported 55 collisions during Q3, which might not seem like much, but that's also double the number of crashes that occurred in Q2 (27), which doubled the number in Q1 (13). This figure appears to be very linear with the number of rides and total miles traveled.
Also, Waymo is coming to Miami next, CNBC reports. Florida Man is going autonomous, folks. Get excited.
Yesterday, we covered General Motors' $5 billion gut punch in China. Now, the whole Western auto industry is wondering if it still has a future in the world's biggest car market. Bloomberg explains exactly what's at risk:
Once a linchpin of GM’s global strategy, the company’s China business is in free fall. The automaker hasn’t given many details of its plans but the partners are looking at difficult options that will shrink its presence. The joint venture will likely cull workers and shutter plants, according to people familiar with the matter. GM is looking at axing specific models, turning brands like Buick—once the preferred car of the Chinese emperor in the 1920s—from a household name into a minor player.
Those decisions will have huge implications for GM’s willingness to stay in China beyond 2027, when its [deal with joint venture partner] SAIC expires. The company said it has no plans to leave and that the planned cutbacks will do the trick, but it will have to assess how long it can tough it out amid price wars.
GM is struggling to compete on price with domestic models subsidized by the Chinese government and could eventually leave the venture if losses persist, people familiar with the matter said. And if SAIC is no longer getting cutting-edge technology or a brand bump from working with a well-known American manufacturer, it may have a reason to walk away, the people said.
Affordable brands like BYD, Nio, and newcomer Xiaomi have begun flooding the local market. These aren't just cheap cars or clones of well-known American brands. No, they're actually extremely attractive EVs that stand on their own merits. Not only are they cheap, but they're packed full of tech and have enough range where buying anything offered by U.S. or European automakers seems silly at best.
Mike Dunne, a former GM exec and expert on the car market in China, says that the country is done with global carmakers. The country has collectively made up its mind and is flocking toward the home teams—even EV powerhouses like Tesla are feeling the heat.
“We’ve seen a collapse of market share and profits all at once and the established carmakers are powerless to stop it,"" Dunne said.
You can see why American automakers are sweating over the potential influx of affordable Chinese EVs in North America. And if tariffs aren't enough to protect domestic automakers from the tech prowess that overseas EVs appear to have, there's going to be trouble in Detroit.
China's car market is arguably the most competitive in the world and GM is feeling the same squeeze that just about every foreign automaker in China is feeling right now. There are more than 100 competing brands, many of which are staying nimble and innovative so they stand a chance at standing out in the crowded EV market. If GM wants to compete, it needs to rethink its strategy.
And this $5 billion reset could help it do that—well, combined with other efforts that it's trying to tackle stateside like tailor-fitting a new breed of batteries to its brand. But if GM doesn't succeed, or geopolitical tensions make selling its cars a burden, the General's future in China could be at risk.
You know, I found it interesting that some folks expect to pay more for a ride in a Waymo or other autonomous vehicle.
The entire idea of a driverless car is to make the long-term operating costs cheaper. When you don't have someone behind the wheel, you (ideally) reduce risk and have a robot essentially working for you 24x7 with no need for rest, sick days, or benefits. It's a capitalist market's dream. Sure, there are more upfront costs, but long term, there are projected cost reductions. Wouldn't you expect the ride to be cheaper?
Then again, others are happy to pay more to not have to deal with a better and more predictable experience. Whether it be Uber, Lyft, or a local taxi company, you never really know what you're walking into.
So now it's your turn: would you be willing to pay a premium to ride in an AV? Why or why not? Let me know in the comments.

EV Reliability Improved In 2024. It Still Lags Behind Hybrids And ICE,https://insideevs.com/news/743394/consumer-reports-reliability-survey-evs/,"Plug-in hybrids still fare the worst when it comes to reliability, although they too are improving.",12/5/2024 10:21,"Good news for anyone considering going electric: the latest Consumer Reports reliability survey shows that EVs made in the last three model years are improving compared to older models. CR compared data about vehicles with all levels of electrification and found that hybrids are more reliable than pure combustion cars, which are better than electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
This CR survey gathered data from around 300,000 2022 through 2024 model-year vehicles and says it got more responses than ever from hybrid and plug-in hybrid owners, showing these models’ growing popularity.
PHEVs still fared badly against combustion cars with 70% more problems than cars with no form of electrification. It’s still a massive improvement over last year when PHEVs had 146% more problems than ICE, but they are still more problematic.
EVs also improved to 42% more problems than ICE from 79% a year ago. CR still says non-plug-in hybrids are about as reliable as pure combustion cars, but it no longer gives a percentage.
Last year it rated hybrid reliability as being 26% better than ICE. This year it just says “many hybrids stand out as the most reliable vehicles you can buy, and our survey data shows that hybrids, as a category, are as reliable as non-hybrid gas cars.” CR also notes that not all hybrids are reliable, pointing to the Ford F-150 hybrid and Volkswagen ID.4 as being among the least reliable in the survey.
But while EV reliability went up, it’s still dragged down by several cars built by inexperienced startup companies. CR’s data points to the fact that the Lucid Air may be the least reliable sedan, but it’s insufficient for a clear picture. It does have enough data for Rivian, though, and it came in last for general brand reliability.
The most reliable EV was the BMW i4, but most EVs (including the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y) showed average reliability while the Model S and Model X rated below average. The Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV are also having issues, with CR noting that “many owners also complained about the EV battery, electrical accessories, climate system, and in-car electronics.”
More On EV Reliability
Some cars, like the BMW iX, Audi Q8 E-Tron and Kia EV6, even lost their CR recommendations due to reliability concerns. Production of the Audi will stop sooner than initially planned, and you probably won’t be able to buy one new after the middle of next year.
Even though CR says plug-in hybrids are generally more problematic, it does recommend the Volvo XC60 PHEV and the Toyota RAV4 Prime. The latter is, in fact, the most reliable vehicle in this year’s survey. The Mazda CX-90 PHEV may still need a few bugs ironed out, as it was rated the least reliable three-row SUV.
Steven Elek, who runs the auto data program at CR, explains that for EVs, it’s not just drivetrain, battery and charging problems that are lowering the score. He says “EVs are often a test bed for new technology, so there are more electrical accessory and in-car electronics issues as well.” This seems like an unstoppable trend that is slowly turning automakers into tech companies whose interest seems to be shifting toward producing the best ""smartphone on wheels.""",Andrei Nedelea
Rivian's Fancy New Charging Outposts Will Be Open To All EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743379/rivian-adventure-network-joshua-tree/,"The new Rivian Adventure Network sites will work with CCS and NACS EVs, and they're powered by 100% renewable energy too.",12/5/2024 9:00,"Charging your electric vehicle at home is great and all, but have you ever tried doing it at a closed car dealership at 10 p.m. when it's raining outside and you're basically out of luck if you need to use the bathroom? Yeah, I'm not a fan of that experience either.
The good news is that Rivian is the latest company to unveil some very common-sense updates to the charging experience, and the first example of this opens to the public today. Even better, more Rivian Charging Outposts like this are coming soon and they'll be open to all EVs.
Today, the EV startup announced the launch of its new Joshua Tree Charging Outpost in California. You may recognize the vibe here: the first Charging Outpost opened earlier this year at a converted gas station near Yosemite National Park. Unlike, say, the off-highway strip mall you've been frequenting for your fast-charging needs, the Rivian site boasts an on-site library, a trail mix bar, a lounge to relax in and, best of all, 24-hour restrooms.
The same approach is coming to Joshua Tree now but this one's even more of an upgrade because it's the first such site that will be open to all EVs and not just Rivian's R1S and R1T.
Rivian Adventure Network, Joshua Tree
""Using a new charger design to accommodate any compatible EV in North America, these sites are an important milestone in support of electrifying the entire transportation sector,"" Rivian officials said in a news release. ""Strategically located to encourage more people to drive electric on their next adventure, these chargers will deliver rapid charging up to 900 volts and feature CCS connectors with support for North American Charging Standard (NACS)-equipped vehicles with an automaker-approved adapter.""
A future hardware update will also allow these stations to support EVs with a native NACS plug, like the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 and eventually Rivian's own R2 and R3 models. As an added bonus, these charging stations will support ""tap-to-pay"" displays so you can charge up without having to install the Rivian app. They'll also be powered by 100% renewable energy, the company said, countering a frequent criticism that EVs get their energy from fossil-fuel sources. That's quickly changing as the grid evolves, but Rivian's getting ahead of it now.
""To achieve widespread electrification, you also need a really good charging network,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""Now, we’re excited to bring the Rivian Adventure Network—with its ease of use and exceptional reliability—to other EV drivers around North America, investing in a future where charging on the road will be simple, sustainable, and convenient.""
There's also good news if you, unfortunately, do not live within the vicinity of Joshua Tree. Rivian said that more fast-charging sites are coming online this year—yes, as in the remaining weeks of 2024—in Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York.
Rivian isn't the first company to try and expand the public EV charging experience beyond the fairly dismal experience many drivers currently deal with. While charging at home is the best way to drive electric, for those who cannot or are on road trips, getting juice out in public often means a hodgepodge of smartphone payment apps, inconvenient locations, long lines and nowhere to get snacks or use the facilities.
But this is changing quickly and evolving into a model that's a bit more like a gas station. Ionna, the charging conglomerate funded by several automakers, has a new family of sites coming soon that boasts retail options and restrooms too. The Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging network is offering similar amenities, and while Mercedes owners get certain perks, those sites are open to all EV drivers as well.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",12/25/2024 1:25,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

The milestone-setting dispenser is part of a new charging station that went online recently in Murrieta, California. It’s located off Interstate 215 in Riverside County and has a total of five 350-kilowatt dispensers that can recharge up to 10 EVs at the same time. If just one EV is connected to a stall, it can benefit from its full power potential, but if two EVs share a dispenser, the power will be split between them.
Last year, the two companies announced that their 1,000th DC fast-charging stall went online. It took them a year and four months to double that figure.

GM and EVgo’s collaboration resulted in public DC fast charging stations for electric vehicles in over 390 locations in 45 metropolitan areas across 32 states. Their co-branded stalls can be found near grocery stores, retail complexes and city centers.
That said, there’s still work to be done. The two entities said they’re on their way toward building a total of 2,850 EV fast charging stalls nationwide, including 400 fast chargers at flagship locations across metropolitan markets including in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, New York and Texas. Most of these will have up to 20 stalls, generous lighting, canopies and amenities.
“Our collaboration with EVgo underscores our dedication to providing EV drivers with the best possible experience by expanding reliable fast charging infrastructure across the country,” said Wade Sheffer, Vice President, GM Energy. “We look forward to continuing to offer premium charging experiences for years to come.”
In total, EVgo has over 1,000 EV fast charging stations and over 3,600 ports across the country, according to the Department of Energy, making it one of the largest public fast charging operators in the United States.",Iulian Dnistran
"Nissan EV Drivers Are About To Get Supercharger Access, With A Big Exception",https://insideevs.com/news/743289/nissan-ariya-supercharger-access/,Owners of Nissan's latest long-range EV will have better charging access starting next week. But a larger group is getting left behind.,12/4/2024 17:30,"Nissan Ariya drivers will get access to over 17,000 Tesla Superchargers next week, the automaker announced Tuesday. Unfortunately, the Nissan Leaf and its outdated CHAdeMO plug will be left behind as the automaker transitions to supporting the North American Charging System (NACS) popularized by Tesla.
Ariya will need an adapter to charge at Tesla Superchargers, like all Combined Charging Standard (CCS) cars that can use the network. The adapter costs $235 and is available for order today via a Nissan dealer or Nissanusa.com (don't ask about Nissan.com). The Supercharger network will open up to Ariyas next Tuesday, December 10. There are no plans to open it up to Nissan Leafs.
I recommend getting your order placed quickly, as adapter supply issues have stunted many automakers' Supercharger access rollout. While Ford and Rivian owners have been able to plug into Superchargers since the spring, some are still waiting on adapters. Recalls haven't helped. General Motors EVs got access to America's largest and most reliable network back in September, and its rollout seems to have gone a bit smoother. I had no trouble getting an adapter for my own Blazer EV.
Related Stories
There's reason to be optimistic that Nissan's will go even better. The Ariya just isn't that popular, which means owners will have less competition for supply-limited adapters. Unlike Ford and Rivian, Nissan, like GM, is also charging for its adapters. That'll prevent people from snagging one on a whim, and so I wouldn't expect many delays.
Yet the whole rollout itself was delayed. Tesla fired its Supercharger team back in the spring, and despite rehiring some the shakeup still slowed the rollout. The company produces most of the CCS to NACS adapters offered by other automakers, and GM had to get secondary suppliers to make sure they had enough. GM's rollout was supposed to come in spring, too, but was delayed until full. So was Polestar and Volvo's rollout. Nissan comes next, with Hyundai, Kia, VW, BMW, Mercedes and others still to come.
Many of those owners still don't know when they'll be able to use Tesla Superchargers. But if you're a Nissan Ariya driver, your time has come. Finding reliable charging will get a whole lot easier starting next Tuesday.

Tesla Is Screwing Over Dozens Of App Developers,https://insideevs.com/news/743076/tesla-api-cost-dev-apps/,Tesla is pulling a Twitter as it prepares to charge third-party software developers huge sums of cash.,12/4/2024 17:00,"The cat is out of the bag, folks: Tesla is preparing to begin charging software developers to access the Application Programming Interface for its cars—something used by just about every third-party dev that builds software that integrates with Tesla's vehicles.
We're not just talking hundreds or even thousands of dollars here. Some developers are potentially looking down the barrel of invoices with multi-million dollar figures on the bottom line—and it's going to screw over not just the engineers building the software that many drivers know and love, but also the people who the software every single day.
Before we jump into things, let's talk about what an API actually is. Essentially, it's a software bridge that enables two programs to talk with one another in very specific ways. Think of it like a dinner menu for software: it tells you what you can eat without letting you actually poke around in the kitchen while also telling you how to order the food (think: the names of food items on the menu, and restaurant policies like ""no substitutions"").
In the Tesla world, APIs create a tunnel between the outside world and your car. If you have the keys, you can give them to a third-party app to authorize it to do common and complex vehicle tasks like open your trunk, document your mileage, or perform automated controls like pre-heating your car's battery at a certain time before you leave for work every day.
Tons of third-party apps have been built on Tesla's API. And there's a good reason for it, too. Tesla's native phone app is great for basic functions, but it lacks more advanced controls for power users, or people who want to go above and beyond what the Tesla app allows folks to access. Tessie, one of the most popular, provides insight on battery health and charging cost projections, and up until this week, was one of the only ways to put Tesla controls on your wrist with a wearable.
Tesla's user-facing API has been undocumented for more than a decade—that is, until, Tesla officially released documentation on how to use the API last October. Until then, it was a community effort that began in 2013 and just kind of worked, unofficially.
Last week, Tesla officially unveiled its pay-per-use pricing for its API. These are the costs that developers will need to pay per vehicle to access data and perform actions for vehicles on its app. And, folks, things aren't looking great if you use one of the dozens of third-party Tesla apps out there that will be affected in just a matter of weeks.
""I'll owe Tesla around $60 million per year using current rates,"" wrote James Gragg, the founding developer of the popular Tesla app, Tessie, on Reddit.
Gragg told InsideEVs that Tessie has been planning on adapting to the API changes for more than a year, so it's not something that the dev hasn't planned for. However, the abrupt change and sky-high pricing make it clear the direction that Gragg and many other devs will have to go if they want to keep their apps active in the Tesla ecosystem.
""[W]e'll need to move off of Tesla's web API and to direct car communication [over IP and Bluetooth Low Energy]. Tesla has recently introduced firmware improvements which will allow this. It's not on all cars yet but hopefully will be within the next few months. Since those are low/no-cost methods, hopefully, I can migrate everyone with little to no impact on functionality or price. That's the best-case scenario that I'm shooting for,"" continued Gragg. ""There is a wild amount of effort required, but I'm dead set on making it work.""
Effectively, this means removing the real-time access to date from Tesla's always-connected cloud and instead requiring proximity-based connection to the car. For local IP connection, this means being on the same wireless network, and Bluetooth Low Energy requires that the driver's phone be physically within reach of the vehicle.
Of course, not all apps will go down this road. As Gragg mentioned, the change takes ""a wild amount of effort"" to make it work. However, if the only alternatives are millions of dollars in API fees or a non-functional app, it seems that developers will have a tough choice to make sooner rather than later.
""The new API pricing from Tesla came as a shock to the community. Tesla did announce a transition to a paid model at the end of 2023, but the new pricing model is quite prohibitive. In most cases, it would require developers to pay thousands of dollars per day to Tesla, whereas developers make only a fraction of that amount,"" said Ramin Nasibov, developer of the Stats App for Tesla, in an email to InsideEVs.
""Most third-party developers are individual, independent developers (I am). There are tens of thousands of Tesla car owners who have come to rely on these third-party apps, which provide the users with features that complement the official Tesla app. We really hope that Tesla reconsiders the API pricing model so that we can continue serving our users.""
In case this cash grab sounds familiar, recall that X—or Twitter, as it was once better known as—did the exact same thing once it came under the ownership of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. This effectively erased some of the most popular third-party Twitter apps from the face of the earth that couldn't afford monthly bills in the tens of thousands of dollars because of API requests made to the platform.
Reddit soon followed suit. CEO Steve Huffman said that he was inspired by Musk's strategic move to ratchet up API prices and did the exact same thing to Reddit's API. Unsurprisingly, popular apps like Apollo bit the dust, at least officially.
This has led to the internet lashing back against the platforms because of the change in user experience. For Reddit, moving from the Apollo app to the official Reddit app meant more ads, less functionality, and more power consumption. For Twitter, apps like Tweetbot were killed, which also meant a less pleasurable experience for users who were instead forced to Twitter's—sorry, X's—native app.
With Tesla pulling the same strings as X and Reddit, it's likely that we'll see the exact same thing happen. Sure, there's the risk of paid apps getting kneecapped, but also a much higher hit to the usability of free apps like A Better Route Planner:
""The Tesla data streaming is a technically good solution that enables really good real-time data for users. The pricing for this data method and the way we use it in ABRP would become $4-5 per vehicle and month, which is not possible for us to sustain as a free service to the users,"" Bo Lincoln, founder of the app A Better Route Planner (now owned by Rivian), told InsideEVs. ""Even with ABRP Premium ($5/month), which is what we typically require for paid telemetry solutions, it would not cover our costs.""
Lincoln explained that ABRP would need to drop Tesla connectivity from ABRP's free user-facing mapping service due to the API charges. And even if users purchased a premium subscription, the live data would need to limit the quality and frequency of the data pulled in order to ensure that its API bill is manageable.
From a user perspective, this is kind of frustrating. Tesla opening up its API last year finally acknowledged the innovation that third-party developers can bring to Tesla's already software-rich ecosystem. Hell, it's even been rumored that the automaker has considered an in-car app store. But financially walling off developers from control of cars is a move that owners should be riled up about.
Tesla shows that it's planning to give folks a $10 credit for personal API use. Perhaps some apps can allow users to input their own API key to use the software to offload the cost from the developer and still maintain functionality. But the ease of seamless click-and-go integration appears to be over, at least without a huge uptick in price.

Would You Turn Your Classic Mazda Miata Into An EV With This Kit?,https://insideevs.com/news/743271/mazda-miata-mx5-ev-conversion/,This EV conversion kit will elevate the NA Miata’s performance considerably while still keeping the car light.,12/4/2024 16:00,"Electrogenic is a company specializing in “drop-in” EV conversion for classic cars and it just announced a kit for the first-generation Mazda Miata built between 1989 and 1997. The U.K.-based firm (one of many) also offers kits for the Jaguar E-Type, Land Rover Defender, Rolls-Royce Phantom, DeLorean, classic Mini and Porsche 911.
The plug-and-play kit for the NA Miata features a 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which sits in the engine bay and gives the car a real-world range of 150 miles (241 kilometers). A full charge takes about one hour. Having the battery pack in place of the engine is a great use of space, and it keeps the trunk free to carry some cargo. However, it also helps preserve the car’s weight distribution and handling balance.
The battery pack does make the MX-5 heavier by around 220 pounds (100 kilograms), but that still only means the car weighs about 2,650 pounds (1,200 kg).
With 160 horsepower and 229 pound-feet (310 Nm) of torque from the electric motor, the power-to-weight ratio is improved by 21% over the original, whose engines never made more than 130 horsepower. With the 130 hp 1.8-liter, an NA could accelerate to 60 mph from a standstill in about eight seconds and Electrogenic says its EV swap will drop that by about two seconds. The top speed is 115 mph (185 km/h), about the same as the original.
While some conversions keep the car’s original transmission and still allow you to shift gears, this kit has a single fixed ratio. For Miata enthusiasts, rowing their own is one of the highlights of the driving experience, so taking away the shifter will also take something away. However, the fact that the car is still so light, even as an EV, should ensure that the legendary Miata handling persists.
Having so much more torque than the original in such a light car should provide a different kind of fun. You should be able to slide the tail around more in the EV conversion and thanks to electric motors’ instant torque delivery, you should have a lot of control under your right foot.
Steve Drummond, Electrogenic CEO, said about the kit: “We’ve long been intrigued by the concept of a light, well-balanced, rear-wheel-drive electrified modern-classic, one that truly delivers when it comes to the old-school thrill of driving. It seems we weren’t alone, as we’ve received a great deal of interest in the idea of an MX-5 conversion over the years. It’s exciting to finally reveal our creation to the world and give MX-5 fans the chance to electrify one of the most popular sports cars in history.”
To answer the question in the title, you probably don’t want to turn your classic Miata into an EV. However, if that’s the only way you’ll still be allowed to drive one in the future, well, an electric Miata is better than no Miata at all, especially since Mazda is still unclear on the formula an electrified Miata should have.

Effortless 'Plug And Charge' Is Coming For All EVs Soon,https://insideevs.com/news/743273/effortless-plug-and-charge-protocol-for-evs/,A universal electric vehicle charging protocol will make the EV ownership experience a whole lot easier.,12/4/2024 15:30,"Charging a non-Tesla electric car isn't as straightforward as it should be. There are half a dozen charging apps on my phone to authenticate and initiate charging at different stations. Even then, I have to often contort to awkward angles at charging stations, over dangling cables, to glance at poorly lit screens on the dispensers to check the charging status. If you drive an EV you've likely had a similar experience. It's a real pain sometimes.
But the charging experience could soon improve with a new nationwide framework in the U.S. that aims to establish a simple ""plug and charge"" method for all electric cars, regardless of the brand. If it goes into effect, charging could be as simple as pumping gas; just pull up and plug-in.
Currently, automakers and charging companies use their own authentication systems. Principally, it's all the same: when you plug in an EV, there's a ""handshake"" between the car and the charger; a process where the two communicate to ensure a safe connection before charging begins.
But this doesn't always work seamlessly and EV owners have to navigate a number of steps before the actual charging begins. Now that's set to change.
The Society Of Automotive Engineers along with a consortium of carmakers and charging companies and the U.S. Government's Joint Office of Energy and Transportation announced a common framework on Wednesday to enable drivers to plug in and charge at all public charging stations, without having to download apps or fiddle with payment systems.
SAE will establish what's called ""Certificate Trust List Requirements,"" which is basically a rulebook for automakers, charging companies and equipment suppliers who will have to meet certain technical and safety standards for plug and charge. Suppliers who meet these standards can apply to be approved for deployment of plug and charge to their networks.
“Today’s announcement focuses the industry on interoperability and security,” said Sarah Hipel, Chief Technology Officer of Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. Several major charging companies and automakers, including Tesla, Electrify America, ChargePoint, General Motors, Ford and Toyota are already part of this consortium and more are expected to join in the coming months and years.
If it's rolled out as promised, EV drivers will simply have to pull up to charging stations, plug-in and walk away. The network would handle the whole ""handshake"" and process payments seamlessly. This would reduce the time spent at charging stations and also ease some of the charging anxiety that's slowing down the mass adoption of EVs.
“We are rapidly approaching a future where every EV driver can just plug in, charge up, and go; the network will talk to your car and process the payment seamlessly,"" said Gabe Klein, Executive Director of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. ""This is a fundamental step in architecture toward enabling bidirectional charging and true vehicle-to-grid integration, the holy grail for energy and transportation.”
Testing of this universal protocol begins in 2025 and availability for the public could take longer than that. Either ways, it's a positive step forward that could make the EV ownership experience a whole lot easier in the next couple of years.

The Pope's New Ride Is This Electric G-Class,https://insideevs.com/news/743265/mercedes-electric-popemobile/,Mercedes just gave the Pope a new set of all-electric wheels.,12/4/2024 15:00,"Mercedes has unveiled the latest version of the Pope's open-air transportation, lovingly called the ""Popemobile."" The 2024 edition has gone electric, with a cut-roof design based on the awfully named ""G 580 with EQ technology."" Or, as everyone else calls it, the electric G.
Mercedes has a long history of furnishing His Holy Father's whips. Because the Pope's duties involve a lot of crowdwork, the Bishop of Rome has long traveled in an open-air car that allows him to greet, bless and interact with worshippers. Though a plexiglass-enclosed version was later used, people mistakenly assume that was a bulletproof setup for the Pope's protection. They're half right. According to plaques next to it at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany, the enclosed Popemobile was designed to protect the Pope. Not from gunmen, though, but from wind and rain.
The new edition has a removable top that covers the front and top of the Pope's seat from the elements. But the sides and rear appear to be open-air, a nice sign of the Pope's openness to his followers. Pope Francis will sit in a large white plush chair, which should allow him to do some 360-degree hand-waving. As per tradition, the seat and the vehicle are a brilliant shade of white.
The all-electric powertrain will help, too, as the first all-electric Mercedes Popemobile is sure to be quieter than any internal-combustion G. (Note that Fisker, of all companies, beat Mercedes to the punch on offering an electric Popemobile ""design."") It also allows him to travel emissions free, a good perk when you represent a Church that aims to protect the Earth and its people. Mercedes says the powertrain has been specially configured for the low-speed driving the Pope does, but offers no more details on powertrain changes. I'll assume, then, that the Pope's driver has access to 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque, more than you need when your main passenger is in an unrestrained swivel chair, outside and, notably, 87. No wonder Mercedes tuned it for more low-speed operation.
The G 580 also comes with a 116-kWh battery. Considering the low speeds, I expect the Pope's hand will get tired long before his car does. And with a 10-80% charge time of just 32 minutes, the electric Popemobile should be capable of a quick turnaround.
Here's it without the rain cover.
Clearly, this is a great use case for an EV, and it's awesome to see the Pope going electric. It's a small win in a world that faces many challenges on its road toward a more climate-friendly transportation sector, but it's good to have His Holiness on our side. Plus, when they see the Pope riding in silent all-electric comfort, maybe some of his followers will get a bit more excited about the electric future.",Mack Hogan
The Chinese EV Market Is Now Unbeatable,https://insideevs.com/news/743253/chinese-ev-market-is-now-unbeatable/,"New subsidies, dizzying variety for consumers and sluggish demand for EVs in other parts of the world is helping China further its lead.",12/4/2024 14:00,"Over the past decade, Chinese automakers have staged a stunning rise in the auto industry, establishing a clear lead over the U.S. and Europe in democratizing electric vehicles. Now the latest sales data suggests that the country is so far ahead in electrification that a miracle would be needed for others to catch up or come even remotely close.
Data from the China Passenger Car Association, posted on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, indicates that China's EV market accounted for a whopping 76% of global EV sales in October. That figure represents new energy vehicles (NEVs), as they're called in China, which include both fully electric models and plug-in hybrids.
Of the 14.1 million NEVs sold globally between January and October, 69% were in China, as per the CPCA. The U.S. accounted for less than 10% of this, with about 1.28 million EVs and PHEVs sold during the same period. Automakers in Europe sold about 2.32 million units in the first eight months of the year, but that growth is now slowing down as legacy brands in the continent struggle to sell EVs.
When you break down 'NEVs' into EVs and PHEVs, things also look good. From January to October, China's share of fully electric global sales stood at 63.2%. The share of PHEVs reached 78%. Simply put, much of the EV mass adoption is driven by China and Norway, with the former having a far greater statistical significance.
However, not all of this is great news. There have been concerns about EV production overcapacity in China spilling over to the rest of the world, especially the Global South, where Chinese EVs are now increasingly popular. Plus, the European Union has imposed a tariff of up to 45.3% on Chinese cars, while the U.S. and Canada both have a 100% tariff on Chinese EV imports, in addition to a proposed ban on Chinese-origin software in future EVs.
These protectionist measures may help the U.S. and Europe keep its homegrown car factories humming, but the numbers indicate that China's domestic market continues to expand regardless. China doubled its EV subsidy in July. EV buyers who replace their gas cars can now get a subsidy of 20,000 yuan ($2,770), double the 10,000 yuan announced earlier this year.
Plus, the competition in the Chinese EV market is far more cutthroat. Automakers like BYD, SAIC and Xpeng, as well as newcomers like Xiaomi, are battling to gain a higher share of the market. Analysts estimate that less than 20 of the 137 EV brands in China will be profitable by the end of the decade.
Now the incoming Trump administration has threatened to repeal the EV incentives for consumers and possibly even manufacturers, likely allowing China to expand its lead further.

"Genesis Will First Add Hybrids To Its Lineup, Then Range Extenders",https://insideevs.com/news/743249/genesis-range-extenders-coming-2027/,The company is backtracking on its previously announced plan to only introduce electric vehicles after 2025.,12/4/2024 13:00,"Genesis isn’t going ahead with its plan to only introduce electric cars after 2025 (and go EV-only after 2030), and it’s going to add hybrid powertrains for most combustion-powered models in its lineup starting next year. Once that’s done, the next step won’t be full EVs (of which it already offers several) but range extenders instead, which the manufacturer expects will be really popular in America.
When Hyundai’s CEO Jaehoon Chang spoke during the automaker’s CEO Investor Day event earlier this year, he said extended-range EVs (EREVs) are seen as “the same as EVs by North American environmental standards.” American regulators do indeed see EREVs as being closer to a pure EV than a hybrid, even though that’s basically what they are.
Range extenders, like the upcoming Ram 1500 Ramcharger or the Mazda MX-30 R-EV, have a smaller battery pack compared to an EV. This allows manufacturers to sell them cheaper since they have fewer (expensive) lithium-ion battery cells. You can look at a range extender as one step above a plug-in hybrid, usually offering more range than a PHEV, but not quite an EV.
Earlier this year, the Korean Car Blog published a report stating that Genesis was going to start building a range-extender GV70 in late 2026 and begin selling it in the U.S. in 2027. The hybrid version of the GV70 will come first, likely next year, followed by the EREV, making the GV70 (pictured) the first Genesis model to offer combustion, hybrid, range extender and full electric powertrains.
The GV70 for the U.S. market is currently being built at the Hyundai manufacturing facility in Alabama, but the range extender will reportedly roll off the assembly line at the manufacturer’s Georgia plant, which currently builds the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9.
Hyundai previously announced that the Georgia facility would also produce hybrids, but it seems now that the manufacturer was likely referring to range extenders.
More On Range Extenders
We don’t know the specifics of the GV70 EREV, but Hyundai has already shared some more general details. We know that even though EREV versions will have a smaller battery, they will have more combined range than pure EVs by including a full tank of fuel. Hyundai says its EREVs will go up to 560 miles (900 km), and it also wants to sell them in China.
The manufacturer wants to sell 40% hybrids globally by 2028, or about 1.33 million vehicles. Offering vehicles with varying levels of electrification (from none to full) is a smart approach by Hyundai that broadens the appeal of its vehicles, and even though it will be first implemented for its Genesis luxury brand, it will likely also be used for Hyundai and Kia too.
More manufacturers will follow and partly shift to range extenders, with the market for pure EVs not looking quite as strong as projections were suggesting a few years ago. Porsche has announced that it wants to add gasoline back into the mix going forward, while Mercedes-Benz reportedly ended its research project into extended-range EVs, although it too has backtracked on its EV plans—the new CLA, which will be available as a hybrid or EV shows Mercedes' midterm strategy.",Andrei Nedelea
Lucid Could Use Two-Speed Transmissions In Future EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/743104/lucid-two-speed-electric-vehicle-patent/,The American automaker is interested in two-speed transmissions that allow electric motors to operate in ideal ranges at different speeds.,12/25/2024 1:25,"Although Lucid already makes the world's most efficient electric cars, it's keen to extend its lead. One area other automakers like Porsche have explored to boost their EVs' range is the use of two-speed transmissions. Lucid has yet to do so, but now it looks like it might apply the technology in its own unique way.
If you don't know how Lucid's drive unit works, you should read up on it. The system is ingenious and, as it turns out, flexible. The electric motor's speed is reduced from tens of thousands of RPM down to wheel speeds by two separate planetary gearsets on either end of the casing. This allows the motor and gearboxes to be coaxial, reducing the drive unit's size and mass. Planetary gearboxes can also be used as transmissions by braking separate parts of the mechanism, and that's what Lucid is doing here.
A patent applied for back in 2023 and recently granted to the automaker describes part of this system, although the precise design seems somewhat obscured. Several patents reference different aspects of what is likely a new drive unit configuration, so the exact nature of it all isn't entirely clear just by reading this one document.
What we can nail down, though, is that the system uses one or more planetary sets on either side of a coaxial drive unit to achieve its two speeds. A system of one-way clutches enables these two ratios. How much of a difference in efficiency can this make? Automakers and suppliers have claimed gains in the region of five percent, although it's going to depend on how and where you drive.
Lucid might be shooting higher than that with this unique design. In recent interviews, the automaker's chief executive, Peter Rawlinson, has claimed the company wants to achieve six miles per kilowatt-hour. For reference, the most efficient Lucid Air can currently achieve about five miles per kilowatt-hour. Do the math on a car with a 100kWh battery; it's a big difference not only in pure range, but also the rate at which charging gets you miles back in the battery. Any charging speed is effectively multiplied by the drivetrain's efficiency.
We know Lucid's SUV, the Gravity, is coming soon. Another mid-size car is coming after that. It's plausible that this new drivetrain tech could be applied to any vehicle in the automaker's lineup, though. An updated Air sedan could see a two-speed transmission get added to at least one axle, although that's pure speculation. Until the automaker pipes up, we won't know its plans for this tech.

The Honda Prologue Is Becoming America’s Sweetheart EV,https://insideevs.com/news/743220/honda-prologue-sales-november-2024/,Honda sold more Prologue EVs in November than Volvo sold EX40s and C40s in the first 11 months of this year.,12/4/2024 11:00,"The Honda Prologue is proving to be this year’s underdog. A badge-engineered Chevrolet Blazer EV with the added benefit of Apple CarPlay, the Prologue is Honda’s only electric offering in the United States. Its future was uncertain, especially considering the not-so-rosy state of General Motors’ Ultium efforts at the beginning of the year.
But what started as a big bag of uncertainties eventually became a resounding success. The Prologue is a hit and it proves Honda is capable of stepping up its electrification game with everything it entails–good lease deals, readily available inventory and an expansive service network.
Honda sold 6,823 Prologue EVs last month alone and 25,132 units from January through November. To put things into perspective, Honda sold more Prologue EVs in a single month than Volvo’s two-EV portfolio managed in 11 months. Year-to-date, the Volvo EX40 and C40 amassed 4,819 sales in the United States and just 493 sales in November. (Yes, it’s bad for Volvo here.)
More Stuff Like This
By comparison, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, which is very similar to the Honda Prologue (they’re even built in the same factory in Mexico), sold 7,998 units in the three months of the previous quarter. Similarly, the Cadillac Lyriq scored 7,224 sales in Q3, while the smaller Chevrolet Equinox EV saw 9,772 sales in the previous quarter.
General Motors doesn’t offer monthly sales figures for its cars, so it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, but from what we have available, it’s clear that Honda is doing something better than GM even though the cars are very similar. The Prologue also did better than the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Toyota bZ4X and Nissan Ariya in October.
At the end of the day, the answer to selling more EVs might be very simple: give people a solid choice with a decent range, decent looks and decent specs. No gimmicks, just something that ticks enough boxes to convince people they’re not making a mistake.
In the case of the Prologue, it offers Apple CarPlay, something that GM decided against in its latest EVs, up to 296 miles of range and a maximum DC charging speed of 150 kilowatts. It doesn’t excel in any way, but it’s just enough for a lot of people.",Iulian Dnistran
Why General Motors Just Took A $5 Billion Hit In China,https://insideevs.com/news/743209/gm-china-5-billion-cm/,"Also on today's Critical Materials roundup: how Stellantis' ex-CEO made ""enemies with everybody.""",12/4/2024 9:54,"For much of this year, we've been covering the rise of the Chinese auto industry as primarily a problem for the European auto industry. Every car company has lost sales in their biggest market as the local competition got better and better, but Volkswagen and others have to do battle with BYD, MG and the rest on their own turf. Tariffs here in the U.S. have kept that problem away from our shores. But car companies are global operators, and if you want an example of how intense this challenge is, look no further than General Motors.
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and technology news. Also on our agenda today: how Stellantis' CEO got fed up and quit after basically making enemies with everyone, and Hyundai gets ready for an Android Automotive shift.
Beijing Auto Show Buick
China was like a giant money-printer for GM for more than a decade. When the country's modern economic boom really started kicking off in force, a newly empowered generation of buyers fell in love with cars from the American automaker, Buick in particular. For a while, it seemed like GM could see almost endless growth in the world's biggest car market, aided (and for a while, legally mandated) by a range of joint ventures with local automakers.
That was then. Now, Chinese drivers want Chinese cars, in large part because their electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid technology far surpasses what the rest of the world can do. GM sales have been plummeting in China for years and the entire operation now needs restructuring. The cost of that is more than $5 billion. Automotive News explains:
GM said in a Dec. 4 regulatory filing that it will take noncash charges of $2.7 billion for the restructuring and $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion to account for the diminished value of its equity in the 50-50 joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp. The charges will affect GM’s net income primarily in the fourth quarter and will be reported as one-time special items.
GM said in the filing that its board of directors’ audit committee determined Dec. 2 that the impairment was necessary “based on a determination that a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JVs is other than temporary in light of the finalization of a new business forecast and certain restructuring actions that SGM is finalizing that are expected to be taken to address market challenges and competitive conditions.”
GM has lost money in China for three consecutive quarters, with its sales in the country falling 18 percent in the first nine months of the year to 1.2 million vehicles. SAIC-GM, which builds Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac vehicles, is one of two joint ventures for the automaker in China.
I don't think I need to explain how much $5 billion is a lot of money, but just in case, let's put that write-down into perspective a bit. GM's global net income before taxes in 2023 was $12.4 billion. Its profits in Q3 of this year before taxes was $4.1 billion. It is projecting pre-tax annual profits of between $14 billion and $15 billion for 2024.
So this loss was basically like wiping out a quarter of profits, not just revenue, and then some, or more than a third of its profits from 2023. There's no other way to put this: ouch.
As I mentioned, GM is hardly alone in its China problems. Volkswagen had success there for decades and it's got similar troubles now. Nissan is basically throwing in the towel in China and even mighty Toyota is getting hammered there. Even Tesla has intense competition in China after kickstarting the modern EV market, and while it's held the line better than most, it can't fend off that much heat forever.
As that story notes, GM CEO Mary Barra in October promised ""a significant reduction in dealer inventory and modest improvements in sales and share"" for China, which is a nice way of saying everybody just needs to lower their expectations from now on. And that portends bad omens for GM's future bottom line.
Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO
As I noted in Monday's Critical Materials, nobody seems sad to see Stellantis' Carlos Tavares abruptly quit his CEO role well ahead of his scheduled 2026 retirement. But that's pretty much the problem in a nutshell.
Reuters has a great deep-dive into what led Tavares to quit, and the biggest factor was reportedly his disputes with the Stellantis board and his total lack of allies in the auto sector. By the end, the board didn't agree with his strategies, and the dealers, suppliers, unions and even customers were fed up with him as well.
If you've ever been in any kind of professional leadership role, you know that playing the politician can be an important part of what you do. And when you don't have any friends left, it's time to go. From that story:
On Sunday, Senior Independent Director Henri de Castries said in a statement that differing views emerged in recent weeks among the CEO, major shareholders and the board.
In November, however, Tavares' brash style led to a ""totally untenable"" relationship with the board, whose members represent major shareholders Exor, the Peugeot family and the French government, the other source said. When board members started asking more specific questions about the executive's strategies, the person said, ""Tavares' reaction was: 'You do not interfere with my job—that is not your business.'""
Board members, irritated, continued pressing Tavares, the source said. They were unsettled by what they viewed as the CEO's relentless but narrow focus on cost-cutting, which had caused supply disruptions and angered dealers. Those problems had been overlooked in previous years, when Stellantis was hitting double-digit profit margins.
Now those and other issues were causing angst across the sprawling company, as Tavares tangled with dealers, unions, suppliers and governments - and now board members
""You cannot make enemies with everybody,"" the person said.
Tavares was renowned in the industry for his cost-cutting skills but not so much for his people skills. Now, Stellantis—which includes 14 brands that operate globally—faces a very uncertain future at a time when it should have had a viable plan years ago.
Speaking of automakers with a plan: you can't deny that Hyundai Motor Group is doing pretty well at the moment. Its EVs are popping off and it's executing hard on hybrids too at a time when GM, for example, is scrambling to figure out where it put the ""How to engineer a Chevy Volt"" manual. But as a Kia EV6 owner myself, I'd say that Hyundai's overall software game isn't where it needs to be yet. Over-the-air updates, navigation and integrated apps just aren't as world-class as the powertrains are.
But there's light at the end of the tunnel and it comes from Google. Hyundai's upcoming cars, starting with the next-generation Ioniq 5 (not the 2025 one with NACS, but whatever's next) will be the first to use Android Automotive. That's the system used by GM, Volvo and a few others, and it comes with full Google integration for Google Maps and other services; I'm a big fan of this system and think it's among the best out there now.
Hyundai dropped that tidbit in its Investor Day event in October but it didn't get a ton of traction until Korean Car Blog pointed it out the other day:
The next-generation IONIQ 5 (known internally as NE2) will operate on an Android-based operating system, introducing a larger and more advanced center screen to host Google Maps. This move underscores Hyundai’s dedication to delivering state-of-the-art technology to its customers.
Google Maps offers exceptional features, including precise navigation, real-time traffic updates, and a vast database of searchable locations. Hyundai’s decision to integrate this platform aligns with its goal of providing drivers with a more seamless and efficient driving experience.
The rollout of mass-produced vehicles is scheduled for 2026. Initial sales will target the U.S., with production at Hyundai’s Meta Plant in America, before expanding to other regions.
I hope this spreads across the board. An update to my car is unlikely, but if I could use Google Maps all of the time instead of the EV6's native navigation, I'd be over the moon.
Ioniq 9 Apple CarPlay
Let's turn away from Tavares (who, after making $39 million a year, is probably gonna chill on a yacht for the rest of his life) and China woes to talk tech. We're almost done with 2024 and a ton of new EVs hit the market this year. Which company is doing software the best, and is that influencing your purchasing decisions at all?
Also: the answer is ""Apple and Google,"" right?

This Guy Made A High-Capacity E-Bike Battery Out Of OId Vape Pens,https://www.rideapart.com/news/742372/homemade-ebike-battery-disposable-vape-pens/,It’ll make you rethink what should and shouldn’t be thrown in the dumpster.,12/25/2024 1:25,"We humans are an inherently wasteful species, and nowhere is this more evident than today. Everything from single-use plastics to disposable electronics are a living testament to this. The sad reality is that a lot of us simply don’t care about how our actions affect the planet, not just for now, but for future generations, too.
We don’t really need to look at the bigger picture, either. The smallest things we do can have a profound effect on the world around us. Take, for example, vapes. I’m sure a lot of you own and use a vape on a regular basis. You see, e-waste is a thing, and the e-waste brought about by disposable vapes seems more than enough to outdo any supposed good they bring to the table.
This was brought to light in an incredibly eye-opening way by UK-based YouTuber and Electrical Engineer Chris Doel when he gathered hundreds of discarded vapes at a music festival and transformed them into something very valuable, something people would pay hundreds of dollars for.
More often than not, the most expensive component in any small electric mobility device is its battery. Spare lithium-ion batteries for e-bikes can set you back hundreds of dollars. But as Chris Doel demonstrates, a look inside reveals that most if not all lithium-ion e-bike batteries are made of the same stuff found inside disposable vapes.
Of course, the logical thing to do here was to put his electrical engineering skills to the test and create his very own e-bike battery out of the discarded vapes. And this is exactly what he did. You can check out the video, and all the creative thinking that went into building the homemade e-bike battery by clicking here.
Chris quickly went to work dismantling every vape and plucking out its battery. He then made use of 3D-printed battery modules to hold the individual cells, and began wiring them together in series, essentially transforming the individual battery cells into one gigantic 48-volt battery.
The technical side of this is very, well, technical, but Chris does a really good job of making it easy to swallow for non-electrically minded folks. But the biggest point here is that he was essentially able to make a high-capacity, high-performance e-bike battery out of literal garbage. All he had to purchase was the 3D-printed modules and battery case, as well as the battery management system—a fraction of what he would’ve otherwise spent if he had bought a brand-new battery.
Talk about turning trash into treasure.
After building his homemade battery, he quickly slapped it onto his e-bike, and managed to cover 33 kilometers all without any pedaling whatsoever. Not bad, and actually at par with a lot of the more affordable ready-made e-bikes on the market today. If he were to use it on pedal assist mode, there’s a good chance he could’ve gone twice the distance, too.
Now, the point of this whole project was clearly to prove a point. There’s so much more to the stuff we treat as garbage, to the point that the whole system is severely flawed. Vape manufacturers intentionally stuff rechargeable batteries into their products without allowing users to charge them, and instead dispose of them while still having a lot of service life left in them.
The batteries used in Chris’ homemade battery pack are rated for around 300 recharge cycles, but the Vape manufacturers that use them only allow you to use them for one.
It took around 130 vapes for Chris to build this e-bike battery for next to nothing. And he explains that around 260 million disposable vapes are thrown away every single year in the UK alone. That translates to around 2,000,000 e-bike batteries, if Chris’ formula were to be followed. So yeah, there’s no shortage of raw materials for making batteries. It’s all just being used for the wrong stuff.
And it isn’t just the batteries that are wasted here, either. Chris points out that a lot of the vape cases are actually made of aluminum, and can be collected and sent over for recycling. Instead, people are leaving them discarded on the floor of clubs, bars, and music festivals. Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if you could actually make a whole bicycle frame out of all the vapes Chris managed to collect.
So yeah, it’s crazy to see how some companies have the audacity to be so wasteful. But that’s largely because they know they can make a buck off of consumers who wouldn’t think twice about throwing away something that’s still very much useful.
So at the end of the day, it’s on us to change the way things work. I’m not saying that you should go out there and aim for a zero-waste lifestyle. This simply isn’t possible for a lot of us. But being more mindful and deliberate, and doing our research on the stuff we buy, will certainly go a long way.

Americans Just Aren't Buying Volvo EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743198/volvo-ev-sales-us-november-2024/,"Without the entry-level EX30 on dealer lots, the Swedish automaker sold shockingly few EVs in the U.S. last month.",12/4/2024 8:14,"Volvo is struggling to sell all-electric cars in the United States. While its EV game has seen solid gains in Europe, China and everywhere else, the story is completely different stateside. As in, it’s very bad. And a lack of new models that are powering Volvo's electric success elsewhere is to blame.
In November, Volvo sold just 493 fully electric cars in the U.S. No typos, you read that correctly. To make matters worse, that's down 41% compared to last November when 840 EVs were sold stateside, but the final blow comes when comparing year-to-date sales.
In the first 11 months of 2024, Volvo sold 4,819 EVs, down a whopping 63% from last year’s 12,923 units. To put things in perspective, Honda has sold 25,000 Prologue EVs since the beginning of the year, and that car isn’t even Honda’s own creation—instead, it’s based on General Motors’ Ultium platform and is assembled alongside other GM EVs in Mexico.
More Volvo Stuff
Back in October, Volvo said that “the car market in the company’s main regions of Europe, China and the U.S. is increasingly under pressure which affects demand.” But General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Kia are doing quite well, so surely there must be other factors at play here.
One reason I can think of is the current EV portfolio offered to American customers. The EX40 and EC40 (formerly known as the XC40 Recharge and C40 Rechage) are the only EVs on sale right now in the U.S., and they’re both $50,000+ cars. We're generally fans of them here at InsideEVs, but in terms of specs they're rather dated compared to more modern examples.
The real problem in the U.S. is the lack of the entry-level EX30. That car should've been on sale earlier this year but because it's made in China, it got spiked by Biden administration tariffs—leaving Volvo without this huge electric growth driver it has in Europe and other regions.
After Volvo worked out pricing, the EX30 is finally on its way to the U.S., with deliveries set to begin before the year ends. In Europe, it proved to be a hit, but because the first version to ship to the U.S. will be the mid-tier, dual-motor, its starting price is $46,195 (including destination).
The Volvo EX30 will arrive at U.S. dealerships by the year's end.
That’s a pretty penny for a car that’s about the same size as a Hyundai Kona, so it will be interesting to see if the subcompact crossover will turn the tide for Volvo stateside. Granted, the Kona doesn't have 422 horsepower, but in such a small car, that sounds like overkill.
And then there's the much more luxurious EX90 SUV. Originally positioned as an electric successor the XC90 that helped reset Volvo for the modern era (which is now returning as a hybrid), American supplies of the EX90 are off to a slow start. A search of Cars.com reveals fewer than 300 are for sale nationwide as of this writing and our early tests indicated it doesn't feel quite ""finished"" in terms of software and features, so Volvo Cars USA won't be able to count on that as a growth-driver for a while.
Also, it’s not all bad news for Volvo. In Europe, sales of its all-electric lineup went up 50% in November and 86% year-on-year. Overall, including combustion vehicles, global sales went up 5% last month and year-to-date, the Swedish automaker sold 9% more cars than in 2023.
Globally, EV sales are also doing well, with a 40% increase in November and a 59% increase year-over-year–it’s just the United States where the brand is suffering on the EV front.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Lease Prices Drop Amid Looming Demand Issues,https://insideevs.com/news/743151/tesla-cybertruck-lease-price-decrease/,"It’s still not cheap, but at least it’s moving in the right direction.",12/4/2024 3:47,"The Tesla Cybertruck is now cheaper to lease. That said, it’s still not exactly what I’d call “cheap.”
Arguably the most controversial vehicle on sale today in the United States, the Cybertruck is listed on the automaker's website with a starting lease price of $899 per month for the entry-level All-Wheel Drive version, while the tri-motor Cyberbeast is $100 more.
That’s a $100 decrease compared to the initial pricing, but don’t let the numbers fool you because the story is a little more complicated. First, the new prices are valid with a $7,500 down payment, a 30,000-mile limit and a 36-month term.
Second, several taxes need to be paid in order to get the EV into your hands, including a $695 acquisition fee. Then, there’s a $395 disposition fee when returning the vehicle. So, let’s do some simple math. With $7,500 down, a 36-month agreement and a 10,000-mile annual limit, we get an effective monthly payment of $1,137. If you want to buy the truck at the end of the lease agreement, there's an additional fee of up to $350.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Want to drive 15,000 miles per year? Sure, you can do that, but it will cost you $1,175 per month. There’s also a 24-month lease option which comes down to $1,347 per month. Cheap, it is not, but neither is the Rivian R1T, which costs $1,061 per month for 36 months and 30,000 miles if you go for the dual-motor version with the Large battery pack.
In the case of the Cybetruck, it looks like Tesla is doing everything it can to boost sales. The angular pickup had a great sales start this year, becoming the best-selling pickup in the United States along the way, but that might not hold for long. This week, assembly workers at the Austin factory where the Cybertruck is made have been told to stay home until Friday. Previously, the reservation backlog seemed to have been exhausted after less than a year, despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk claiming the Cybertruck amassed “millions” of reservations.
According to data from Cox Automotive, roughly fewer than 30,000 Cybertruck were sold and registered in the United States in the first nine months. That’s a solid performance from a newcomer and one that beat both the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T. That said, we’ll see what will happen during the fourth quarter.",Iulian Dnistran
Why Hyundai Is Sticking With CarPlay 'Right Now',https://insideevs.com/news/743097/hyundai-apple-carplay-gm/,The brand is open to better alternatives to CarPlay in the future. But right now it wants to give people options.,12/3/2024 14:00,"If you’ve been turned off by General Motors’ now-infamous decision to eliminate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from its electric cars, here’s some good news for you: Hyundai’s got your back.
The South Korean brand is sticking with the popular phone-mirroring applications, a Hyundai executive told InsideEVs recently. For now, at least.
“Right now, we’re still maintaining Android Auto and Carplay,” Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy at Hyundai, said in an interview. “It’s a little bit like EV charging. As we’re moving, give people all the options.”
The Hyundai Ioniq 9.
Boyle is referring to Hyundai’s decision to adopt Tesla’s charging port design and give its customers access to around 17,000 Tesla Supercharger plugs. (That’s something most of the auto industry has done too, I might add, but Hyundai has been particularly speedy about it.) She says during this time of profound change in the auto industry—from familiar gas cars to software-heavy, battery-powered vehicles—it’s key to give consumers options and not try to force them into a technology they’re not ready for.
For Hyundai, that means beefing up its cars’ user interfaces while also delivering the CarPlay and Android Auto people know and love. It also means offering combustion models, hybrids and plug-in hybrids alongside fully electric cars. “Eventually, we’ll all be fully EV,” Boyle said. “But it’s going to take some time, and you don’t want your business to fail in between. So you need to have a strategy that can adapt.”
Unsatisfied with the relatively low-margin business of selling cars, automakers have been trying to act more like tech companies. They’ve got big plans to rake in billions off of software services like games, subscriptions and entertainment features. That’s pushed carmakers to invest more in sleek digital interfaces and it’s led some—like GM—to shun the influence of Apple and Google from their software ecosystems.
GM has caught a lot of flack for its move, since so many Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC drivers like the convenience of using their phone's operating system and have a bad association with historically clunky automotive software. Others, like Tesla and startup Rivian, have never offered CarPlay either.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Hyundai hasn’t gone that far, but it is working on its tech. In the just-unveiled Ioniq 9 three-row SUV, the brand debuted “features on demand,” a platform that lets owners buy upgrades for their vehicle on the go. It’s starting out with special lighting options and custom themes for the SUV’s displays.
Whether automaker software and phone-mirroring features coexist in the future or not, Boyle thinks the auto industry will eventually converge on some kind of standard. Knowing what Hyundai has in the pipeline, she says there may be better alternatives to CarPlay and Android Auto “that people are not even imagining now.” That “might be the future,” she said.
Still, getting people to change their ways would be a battle. “People are so tied to everything,” Boyle said. “So we’re going to give it some time to play out.”

"Honda's First Electric Scooters For India Are Coming Soon, You Guys",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742510/honda-activa-qc1-ev-scooters/,One of them is even bringing the swappable Honda Mobile Power Pack e: to the party in select cities!,12/25/2024 1:25,"If you've been reading RideApart for a minute, you may be aware that I've been following Honda's Mobile Power Pack e: developments with interest for the past few years.
So far, we've seen it appear in scooters in Japan, Europe, and Indonesia, in construction equipment, in cool concepts for electric generators that can power your home, and even powering tourist boats. Will you need more than one HMPP e: for some of these applications? Sure, but the modularity and purposely wide range of use cases is kind of the entire point of this system.
If you've been wondering when Honda would finally bring the HMPP e: to India, the wait is over at last. Order for the newest member of the Honda Activa family, the Activa e: (you totally saw that name coming, right?) will officially open in India on January 1, 2025.
For those unfamiliar, the combustion version of the Honda Activa has been extremely popular for a long time, so developing an EV version that utilizes the new HMPP e: was kind of a no-brainer. Of course, if you're going to have swappable batteries, you also need swappable battery stations that riders can access and use out in the wild.
So far, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India has established Honda Power Pack Exchanger swap stations in Bengaluru and Delhi, with additional plans to roll out in Mumbai soon. The Activa e: uses two HMPP e: packs, which each provide 1.5 kWh and offer a claimed 102 kilometers (about 63.3 miles) on a single charge. For city riding, something like this is ideal. This is where EV motorbikes absolutely thrive.
At the same time, Honda India is also introducing a non-swappable EV scooter, the QC 1. Both scoots get cool modern features like full LED lighting, ride modes, and big digital displays on their dashboards (a whopping 7-inch TFT display on the Activa e: and a smaller 5-inch LCD on the QC1). The Activa e: can also offer phone connectivity via the optional Honda Roadsync Duo app, allowing for turn-by-turn navigation, phone and music access, and more.
Pricing information hasn't been announced yet, but deliveries are expected to begin in February 2025. Additionally, HMSI says it's hoping to produce around 100,000 of both of these electric scooters (combined, not individually) from its plants in India per year. Will the demand be there? That remains to be seen, but Honda India's most recent moves seem to indicate that it knows what it's doing.

EVs And Hybrids Helped Hyundai And Kia Reach Record Sales Last Month,https://insideevs.com/news/743077/hyundai-kia-record-sales-november-ev-phev/,"The Kia EV9 is already selling better than the EV6. At Hyundai, EV sales went up a whopping 77% from last year.",12/3/2024 11:00,"It’s safe to say that both Hyundai and Kia are doing pretty well on the all-electric and electrified vehicle front. The two Korean automakers posted best-ever November sales numbers in the United States, thanks in part to their battery-powered model lineup.
Hyundai’s total sales, including combustion, hybrid and electric models, went up 8% last month. However, it’s on the electrified front where the numbers are truly staggering: EVs went up 77% year-over-year, hybrid sales grew by 104% and all electrified model sales (EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids) increased by 92%.
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV went up an impressive 110% year-over-year in November. Sales of the Santa Fe hybrid jumped 64% while the Tucson plug-in hybrid went up 23%. In total, Hyundai Motor America sold 76,008 cars in November–out of these, 4,989 were Ioniq 5s and 1,121 were Ioniq 6s.
More Good News
Meanwhile, Kia sold 70,107 units last month. That’s a 20% increase over November 2023 and the first-ever November to surpass the 70,000-unit mark stateside. A big part of this success is attributed to the SUV lineup’s sales performance, as well as the significant gains recorded by the automaker’s electrified vehicle lineup.
“Hyundai delivered an exceptional sales month, driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor America. “Customers continue to be attracted to Hyundai’s diverse vehicle lineup which can meet a variety of customer needs. We also saw significant interest and excitement for the worldwide debut of the U.S.-built IONIQ 9 and we can’t wait to bring it to market next year.”
The all-electric EV6 saw sales climb 46% year-over-year, while the Sportage models (combustion, hybrid and plug-in hybrid) went up 28%. The EV9 electric three-row family sold 2,155 units last month, slightly better than the EV6’s 1,887 units. In total, Kia sold 20,066 EV9s and 19,604 EV6s in the first 11 months in the United States.
The Ioniq 5 was Hyundai's best-selling EV in November.
At Kia, the EV9 surpassed the EV6 to become its best-selling EV in November.
“Kia is clearly a brand on the move with world-class ICE and electrified vehicles that far exceed consumer expectations that have helped us achieve back-to-back monthly sales records in Q4,” said Eric Watson, vice president, sales operations, Kia America. “The Telluride has had an immeasurable impact on Kia since launching in 2019, and to reach all-time best monthly sales in 2024 speaks to its enduring appeal. And with five all-new and significantly redesigned vehicles recently unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show, we have no plans of slowing down.”
With an increasing portfolio of electric vehicles, including the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and sporty Kia EV9 GT, the two Korean automakers are on their way to a very good year in sales. However, looking at the numbers posted so far, it’s clear that there is still a long way to go until pure EVs catch up to their combustion and hybrid counterparts. At Hyundai, the combined year-to-date sales of the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 amount to 50,860 units–just 6.7% of the total 758,304 vehicles sold. It’s worth mentioning that the sales of the Kona EV are not reported separately from the rest of the versions, but it’s unlikely it would make a big dent in the big picture.
At Kia, the story is similar: the individual sales of the Niro EV are not reported separately, but the EV6 and EV9 managed to sell 39,670 units combined in the first 11 months–just 5.5% of the total volume of 723,185 cars sold to date.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tesla Won't Sell You A V2L Adapter, But These Companies Will",https://insideevs.com/news/742948/tesla-model-v2l-power-adapter/,"Tesla couldn't be bothered by adding V2L to its cars, so companies are taking it into their own hands.",12/3/2024 10:00,"Tesla, once a pioneer in the EV space, is falling behind. Now, sure, the EV maker's cars still boast cutting-edge tech and a promise to become robotaxis, but there are some glaring omissions from the hot-tech list that other automakers have begun to make standard features in their battery-powered cars. One of those happens to be bidirectional Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) power sharing.
Despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk calling V2L ""extremely inconvenient,"" Telsa said the feature would come to its EVs in 2025. But rather than wait for Tesla to make good on its promise, third-party companies are taking it into their own hands. Tesla's V2L era is (prematurely) here.
Vortipower is the newest company specializing in Tesla-V2L to start making waves on social media. Its product, which gives 3.5 kilowatts of juice in the form of two 15-amp 120-volt outlets, promises to make the process of V2L super simple for owners—just plug in and go. That's enough power to run a refrigerator, space heater, an air conditioner, or some lights if the power in your home were to go out. The device will continue to sip power until the car reaches 20% remaining in its high-voltage pack and then cut off the electricity to any connected device to avoid discharging the battery too far.
Now, here's the gripe—this product is expensive. At the $1,499 list price, it towers above the $99 adapters offered by Lectron for the Hyundai's E-GMP vehicles. Fortunately, there are more affordable options. Chinese accessory manufacturer WeiDian sells a similar product called the Power 2 for under $350 in its domestic market. Then there's A2Z EV (the company that makes the controversial Supercharger extension cables) that sells a V2L adapter with just one outlet for a more reasonable $130.
Vortipower claims that it has verified that its V2L adapter works with ""all Tesla models currently available on the market,"" including older variants of those models. While it doesn't hold a UL certification, it also says that the way it saps power from the car's high-voltage battery is safe and won't adversely affect the pack's health.
However, that's not to say that Tesla won't have problems with you running one of these adapters. See, the automaker has a bit of a conflict of interest in order—which could be one of the reasons that it hasn't enabled power sharing in the majority of its cars just yet. Enter: the Powerwall.
One of Tesla's revenue generation schemes is its whole-home battery backup, the Powerwall. By enabling cars to share power, even something as simple as V2L, it's hard to ignore that this takes away from the value of its $10,000 battery backup system and could undercut demand. The conflict becomes even more apparent when peeking at Tesla's limited vehicle warranty, which explicitly prohibits using the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, or Model X ""as a stationary power source"" and voids the warranty.
Vortipower says that it can't guarantee its product doesn't void Tesla's warranty either:
""While we cannot guarantee that Tesla’s warranty will remain unaffected, we’ve designed the PowerShare device to operate safely within Tesla’s protocols,"" wrote Vortipower. ""Our product is engineered to avoid causing harm to the vehicle’s battery or systems when used as intended.""
Meanwhile, owners are stuck waiting. Tesla insisted that it would bring bi-directional charging to all models in 2025, though it was in the middle of retooling its power electronics when it made that promise in 2023. Whether Tesla meant all legacy models or just new vehicles is an unknown—Tesla is known for enabling new features via a simple software update—but if the feature is reliant on a power electronics hardware upgrade, then it may not be so simple.
It seems that the functionality is already there, at least for basic 3.5-kW V2L needs. If nothing else, products like Vortipower highlight just how accessible the power is, even if the means of tapping into it aren't officially sanctioned. However, with Tesla threatening the vehicle's warranty, one use of the charger could make a simple warranty claim an uphill battle with the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act. Is it worth it to beat Tesla to the punch? Maybe. But I'll let you decide.

Elon Musk Will Not Get A $100 Billion Pay Package For Christmas,https://insideevs.com/news/742984/judge-reject-musk-pay-package/,"Plus, Stellantis gets a $7.5 billion loan for building batteries, and GM backs out of its nearly-completed battery plant.",12/3/2024 9:51,"Remember Elon Musk's $56 billion payday? I know what you're thinking: not this news again. But, yes, this news again—Musk's multi-billion-dollar pay package is once again a topic of debate. More than five months after it fell off the news cycle, things aren't looking great for ol' Elon despite the value of his would-be pay package nearly doubling since Summer. Too bad he can't touch it.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Musk's newly-rejected $56 billion pay package (yes, again), Stellantis gets a $7.5 billion EV loan, and General Motors cashes out of a nearly-completed battery plant. Let's jump in.
On Monday, the Delaware judge presiding over perhaps the largest single display of corporate opulence in history decided that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not entitled to a pay package now valued at $101.4 billion after post-election share price jumps, the New York Times reports. For the record, that's up rom $56 billion previously. This might seem like something you've heard before, but the Monday ruling of Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick is upholding the court's previous verdict denouncing the pay package despite majority shareholder backing in June.
First, the backstory. McCormick's initial rejection of Musk's pay package stems back to 2018 when the compensation package was drafted. According to McCormick, Musk improperly controlled the process used to negotiate the pay package. Furthermore, the judge noted governance irregularities, including that the board was populated with members who were ""beholden"" to the CEO which created a vast conflict of interest.
The board argued that Musk deserved the compensation package given that he managed to hit all of the seemingly insurmountable targets, and thus created immense profits for the company (and investors).
McCormick asked the board to go back to the drawing board and renegotiate the package before properly presenting it to shareholders. Instead, Tesla used a Delaware corporate loophole to call a shareholder vote to ratify the pay package. Things got even more serious when the board created a website and even paid for ads on the CEO's privately-owned social media platform, X, urging shareholders to vote in favor of the package. Shareholders voted and the compensation package passed.
However, Monday's decision by McCormick ratified a formal rejection of the plea to reinstate Musk's pay package.
“Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” said McCormick in her 101-page ruling.
Now, look, it's easy to see why this is such a hotly debated topic. Musk isn't the most popular guy right now, and $100 billion (let alone the initial $56 billion) is a lot of money, even for the world's richest person. Hell, it's almost the entirety of Bill Gates's net worth.
But it's hard to ignore why, from a financial perspective, this is such a big story. It's the single largest executive pay package in history. To put it into perspective, it's 33 times larger than the next-largest executive compensation plan.
As of Monday, Forbes' billionaire list puts Musk's net worth at $336.8 billion, roughly $110.9 billion ahead of the world's next-richest person, Jeff Bezos.
So what's next? It's unclear, but it's extremely likely that the rejection will be challenged by Tesla, Musk, and a team of lawyers. Musk called the decision ""absolute corruption"" and ""totally crazy,"" followed by a slurry of reposts on X showing his displeasure with the judge's ruling.
It's possible that an appeal could be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, though that could push this final outcome out a year or more.
Stellantis, abruptly left without a CEO at the helm over the weekend, may soon join the ranks of Rivian with a multi-billion-dollar loan from the U.S. Department of Energy aimed at furthering the domestic production of EVs.
Uncle Sam is opening up his checkbook and is ready to sign a whopping $7.54 billion payment to a joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI called StarPlus Energy. The large cash infusion is part of the outgoing Biden administration's plan to domesticate EV production all the way down to the battery level. StarPlus' loan will be used to supercharge its battery cell output by bankrolling the venture's planned production sites in Indiana.
Call it the next gold rush, or maybe the EV equivalent of drill, baby, drill—whatever it may be, know that battery production is so hot right now. StarPlus knows this, which is why it's setting up shop at not one, but two planned plants in Indiana where it intends to manufacture enough batteries to power 670,000 vehicles annually.
The first plant, which is already under construction, is slated to open in 2025 while the second is slated for 2027. Separately, Stellantis intends to build another battery factory in Canada with the help of LG Energy Solution.
More and more automakers have been domesticating EV production all the way down to the component level. This Biden-era shift has been influenced by the EV tax credit, which requires production and battery materials to be sourced more domestically. Likely, this protectionist-influenced shift will be aided by the CHIPS act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act (which brought the EV tax credits) and with DoE-issued loans such as what Stellantis and other automakers are conditionally receiving.
We also know that the Biden administration is shoveling out this money as fast as it can before the government changes in January, so expect more news along these lines, potentially.
EV automaker Rivian was recently awarded a $6.6 billion conditional loan by the same office. Musk, who was tasked with heading the ironically-named Department of Government Efficiency under the incoming Trump administration, criticized the DoE's decision to issue Rivian a loan despite Tesla also receiving funds from the DoE in 2010. Musk has not yet commented on the DoE's decision to loan the StarPlus venture roughly 15% more.
While Stellantis is preparing to gear up battery production, GM has worked out that it needs to downsize. The automotive giant has decided that it will unload its stake in the nearly-completed $2.6 billion Lansing, Michigan battery production plant to its production partner, LG Energy Solution (LGES).
GM's pull-out represents a larger cooling for the EV industry which overshot its expectations globally on how rapidly electric car sales would take off. CEO Mary Barra told the world earlier this year that the parent company expected to miss its goal of one million GM-powered EVs hitting the road in 2025 because of the ""market not developing"" as expected. Now GM will offload its stake in the plant just before it is expected to go online.
To put into perspective just how close this plant is to being finished, GM said earlier this year that production was expected to start in early 2025—three years after the plans were revealed to the world. The plant was expected to employ around 1,700 people, though it's not clear if this will change under LGES' control.
GM says that it has around $1 billion tied up in the plant but expects to recoup its investment when the two companies close the deal in March.
The move also comes just after GM says that it plans to ditch its hard-pushed Ultium branding amid a larger shift in electrification strategy. The brand says that the name will be sunset and won't refer to any of its future battery products, only those involved with its LGES joint venture, which, obviously no longer includes its Lansing plant.
Furthermore, GM is convinced that a ""one type fits all"" battery is no longer the path forward. It will instead tailor solutions to fit its vehicles, meaning using a combination of high-nickel, mild-nickel, and Lithium Ion Phosphate (LFP) chemistry across its packs, which could be existing pouch cells or easier-to-assemble prismatic cells. It sounds exhausting, working all of this new tech into a rapidly changing industry. But GM seems to know what it's doing here, so let's trust the process and see where it takes the brand.
GM is up to something. With the automaker slicing Ultium out of its lineup and pulling the plug on one of the most anticipated battery plants that have yet-to-open, it's clear that the brand has had a revelation on the electrification front.
The moves came just months after GM's new battery chief, Kurt Kelty, joined staff as the Vice President of Batteries (fun title). And if that name sounds familiar, it's because Kelty was one of Tesla's longtime battery executives. His task? According to a GM spokesperson speaking with InsideEVs in February, solve more future-facing problems rather than focus on immediate Ultium issues. Think: cost reductions, end-to-end battery development, and more.
It seems like GM is at a pivotal point in its EV timeline and the brand has already made a decision on how it needs to navigate a changing political and unsettled economic climate. But what exactly is GM's secret sauce? And, more importantly, what would you like to see GM do with its all-but-blank battery slate for future vehicles? Let me know in the comments.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Rally Actually Rocks: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/742491/2024-ford-mustang-mach-e-rally-review/,This isn't just another crossover with a badge—the Mach-E Rally is genuinely good on the dirt.,12/25/2024 1:25,"There are so many crossovers out there pretending to be off-roaders. Hell, you can get a toughened-up Nissan Rogue these days (and honestly, it's not half bad). But for the most part, adding grippier wheels and faux running boards to a crossover does not an off-roader make.
Ford at least put some effort into the new Mach-E Rally. It has a 1.0-inch lift, optimized springs, genuine underbody protection, and a pretty nifty body kit to boot. Tack on the Mach-E GT's powerful output and you've got yourself a genuinely fun little off-road EV.
With two electric motors and a 91.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the Mach-E Rally has 480 horsepower and a whopping 700 pound-feet of torque. Alongside the GT, it's the most powerful Mach-E money can buy—hell, it's one of the torquiest EVs on sale anywhere today.
Tick over to the Mach-E’s “Unbridled” powertrain mode to uncork all 700 lb-ft. A huge wave of electrons launch the rally-ready SUV to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds—just a tenth of a second slower than the standard GT—and on to a limited top speed of 128 mph. It's quick as heck. There's even a faux acceleration sound that's pretty convincing at speed (it sounds like a rumbly V-6).
Ford tweaked the suspension specifically for off-road use. But that also means the Mach-E Rally is plenty compliant on pavement, too. Standard MagneRide shocks, slightly softer dampers, and tweaks to the anti-roll bars and bushings give it a more pliable yet still compliant ride.
There's a titch more body roll when you flick this Mach-E hard into a turn compared to other trims in the model range, presumably from the added ride height. But it handles well otherwise. It has ample body control, excellent balance, and a light but responsive steering feel.
There is some tire noise from the chunkier Michelin CrossClimate2 all-seasons, especially at highway speeds. And that massive rally-style wing makes rearward visibility a thing of the past. But who cares, this thing was made for rallying.
Since I'm about 5,000 miles and an ocean away from Col de Turini, a dinky dirt road is the next-best option. Step one is to dig into the touchscreen (mildly annoying) and select the RallySport drive mode, made specifically for the Mach-E Rally. Activating this mode smooths out the throttle response—instead of an instant shove of torque, power arrives in a more linear way. This mode also softens the dampers and relaxes the traction control just enough to allow you to rip off some sweet dirt drifts. If you really want to get wacky, you can disengage traction control entirely.
Even on this tight dirt road with a few tiny corners, the Mach-E Rally is an absolute hoot. Prod the throttle and yank the steering wheel hard to send the back end into a tidy, refined drift. Get up to speed and the softened suspension skips over rocks and powers through ruts like a genuine rally car, while the chunkier rubber claws its way through the dirt.
There's a bit of cladding on the fenders and side sills to protect it from kicked-up rubble, and a film on the doors helps to save the paint. There's even genuine underbody protection in the form of two panels, front and rear.
The one downside is that the Mach-E Rally doesn't have a limited-slip differential. Instead, it uses brake-based torque vectoring, which is less predictable and harder on the rotors. For the 95 percent of owners who won't take this thing to an actual rally stage, it's no big issue. But for the slim majority who might actually aim this car down a logging road in earnest, you'll have to live without that one key feature.
Otherwise, Ford made a genuinely compelling Mach-E rally car. And it still has all the things that make the standard Mach-E such a great electric SUV.
The extended-range battery comes standard on the Rally model, which gives it 265 miles on a single charge. Plugging into a 150-kilowatt DC fast charger refills it in just over 35 minutes, and there's a one-pedal mode for ultra-efficient driving.
The interior feels premium and airy, with high-end materials almost everywhere you look (apart from a chintzy-feeling rotary shift controller). The Rally model adds gloss white accents on the steering wheel and dash, and a unique trapezoidal pattern shared with the exterior. And love it or hate it, you get the same 15.5 vertical touchscreen found on other Mach-Es with functions like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. It even has BlueCruise hands-free highway driving (a $2,100 option with a three-year subscription).
Not to mention the Mach-E Rally just looks cool as hell. The 19-inch rally-inspired white wheels fit the personality of the car perfectly, the custom grille with two integrated fog lights further hammers home the rally theme, and that massive rear wing looks awesome, which Ford says was inspired by the Focus RS. My test car had two slick racing stripes down the middle with that same trapezoidal pattern from the cabin, though unfortunately, an uninspired Glacier Gray paint job. Go for one of the good colors; Grabber Blue, Grabber Yellow, or Eruption Green.
With a starting price of $60,990 and an as-tested price of $65,485, it’s definitely not the cheapest performance crossover out there ($55,890 for the Mach-E GT AWD and the Rally trim is another $6,000 on top of that). But while I was expecting another warmed-over soft-roader, the Mustang Mach-E Rally was genuinely impressive and thoroughly charming.
See, electric SUVs can be fun.

Aptera Needs Your Money To Bring Its Solar EV To The Market–Again,https://insideevs.com/news/743053/aptera-crowdfunding-campaign-again-production/,The American startup needs roughly $60 million to get the first production units off the assembly line.,12/3/2024 8:00,"Aptera, the California-based startup working on a solar-powered three-wheeled electric vehicle, has re-opened its crowdfunding campaign to finish development and start assembling production-ready units. The move comes after the previous campaign ended in May with a rather impressive tally: $135 million raised from 19,000 investors.
But as other startups have learned, sometimes the hard way–cue the Fisker story–making a car from scratch is very expensive. In Aptera’s case, it needs an additional $60 million or so to make its two-seater solar EV a finished product that people can actually buy.
As per Aptera, those interested in investing in the startup can do so with a minimum sum of $1,000. This will buy shares in the startup, with each share priced at $14.80, according to the solar EV maker.
More Aptera Stories
The up-and-coming entity is currently testing its first production-intent prototype that uses a different electric motor compared to previous prototypes. The electric three-wheeler was initially supposed to be powered by a hub motor at the rear but the newest iteration of the mule has an inboard drive unit made by Vitesco Technologies. The change was made because the hub motor wouldn’t have been ready in time for the start of production, Aptera said.
But when is the solar EV going into production? The latest estimate from the startup says that will happen sometime next year, with an initial run of around 7,000 units. That all hinges on whether or not Aptera can convince enough people to give it $60 million, though. So far, it has made a handful of prototypes and a lot of promises.
On paper, the solar-powered three-wheeler sounds like an ideal commuter. With small solar panels covering the entire body, Aptera claims the EV can gain up to 11,000 miles of range per year from harnessing the sun’s energy alone. That’s around 30 miles per day in ideal conditions. If it’s cloudy, raining or snowing, that figure will certainly be lower, but owners can still recharge the batteries as a conventional EV. In total, the Aptera SEV can go up to 400 miles on a full charge, as per the manufacturer.
Estimated pricing is between $25,900 and $48,300 depending on the number of solar panels on the body, battery size and powertrain configuration.",Iulian Dnistran
Ford Puma Gen-E: Mustang Mach-E’s Little Brother With Up To 233 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/742709/ford-puma-gen-e-electric-specs-range-battery/,The electric crossover is smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV.,12/3/2024 4:30,"The well-known Ford Mustang Mach-E electric crossover now has a little brother–in Europe, at least. Meet the new Ford Puma Gen-E, a battery-powered subcompact crossover that’s smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV but somehow has a bigger trunk than some large SUVs.
Measuring 165.9 inches long and 71 inches wide and with a wheelbase of 101.8 inches, the new Puma Gen-E is roughly 4 inches shorter than the Bolt EUV and the smallest electric vehicle in Ford’s European portfolio. The combustion-powered Puma is the automaker’s best-seller in Europe, and with the introduction of the electric version, Ford is hoping it can turn the tide that forced it to idle its flagship EV factory in Cologne due to poor demand for the Explorer EV and Capri.
Set to be built at its factory in Romania, the Ford Puma Gen-E is available with a single battery version–a 43-kilowatt-hour (usable) lithium ion pack with nickel manganese cobalt chemistry. On the four-door crossover, it can deliver a combined WLTP-rated range of up to 233 miles. The maximum DC fast charging speed is 100 kW, and it takes a little over 23 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% state of charge. Ford did not say how much power the on-board AC charger can accept or how long a top-up on a Level 2 charger would take.
Two trim levels will be on offer, but a single powertrain is available–a front-mounted single electric motor making 165 horsepower and 214 pound-feet of torque. It takes eight seconds for the Puma Gen-E to accelerate from a standstill to 62 miles per hour. That’s nearly as fast as the sporty, gas-powered Puma ST which needs 7.4 seconds to reach 62 mph.
Design-wise, the electric Puma is very similar to its dinosaur juice-powered siblings. The biggest difference is the Mustang Mach-E-like front “shield” design. Different alloy wheels and a sporty rear spoiler complete the picture.
Inside, there’s a pair of screens–a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen running Ford’s latest Sync 4 system and a 12.8-inch digital instrument cluster. Both come as standard, as does the wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.
More Stuff Like This
One thing that set the gas-powered Puma apart from its rivals was the clever use of space, particularly in the trunk, where the so-called MegaBox adds 2.8 cubic feet of cargo space under the floor. Well, in the Puma Gen-E, that under-floor storage is even bigger, as the name GigaBox would suggest. In total, the electric Puma has a cargo volume of 20.2 cubic feet, with the GigaBox accounting for 5.1 cubic feet. There’s also a 1.5 cubic feet front trunk that seems more like an afterthought than anything else.
The base model comes with 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, cruise control, a six-speaker audio system, heated door mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, ambient lighting, Amazon Alexa and four-way adjustable front seats. The Premium trim adds a B&O Play sound system with ten speakers, keyless entry, a hands-free tailgate, 18-inch wheels and Dynamic Matrix LED headlights with Glare-Free High Beam. Intelligent adaptive cruise control with stop & go and lane centering, as well as cross-traffic alert and a 360-degree camera system are optional.
The Ford Puma Gen-E will go on sale in Europe in the first part of next year. Pricing has not been announced yet.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Line Workers Told To Stay Home: ‘No Need To Report To Work’,https://insideevs.com/news/743007/tesla-cybertruck-assembly/,It looks like there’s a demand problem for the electric pickup that allegedly had millions of reservations before going on sale.,12/3/2024 3:42,"The Tesla Cybertruck is arguably the most controversial new vehicle on the market–five years after it was initially shown to the public in prototype form. Some love it, others hate it, but one thing is clear: you’ll be noticed on the road if you happen to be inside a Cybertruck.
It’s an attention-grabbing machine, and its sales success has so far been undeniable. It managed to climb to the top of the best-selling electric pickups chart in the second quarter in the United States, surpassing the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning, both of which have been on sale for longer.
But the initial boost seems to be drying out. Yesterday, workers at Tesla’s Austin factory, which assembles the Cybertruck, were told to stay home for the next three days, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. ""On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week (Dec. 3-5), you do not need to report to work,"" the memo said.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Workers were told to report back to work on Friday and that they would still be paid for the three days that they were supposed to work. Tesla doesn’t reply to questions from the media, so there’s no way of confirming if this is related to a demand problem or something else. Some workers would not follow the adjusted schedule and would be notified separately, the memo said.
However, factory workers on the Cybertruck line have occasionally been given other duties instead of building trucks since late October, according to Business Insider. Four workers said they had inconsistent schedules in the past month, either because they were sent home or given additional training exercises or cleaning duties instead of regular duties.
""When I started at Tesla you could expect to get overtime pay, now I feel lucky to get 40 hours,"" one worker on the Cybertruck line said.
Back in April, Tesla shortened the shifts for workers on the Cybertruck production line in Austin, Texas, as per a memo seen by Business Insider. Then, in October, the automaker started deliveries of the non-Foundation Series models–which are at least $20,000 cheaper than the limited-edition models that were the first to ship.
Fast-forward a few weeks and the alleged multi-year backlog of orders appears to have dried out in just a few months, with Tesla inviting reservation holders who pre-ordered as late as 2023 to get their trucks.
In total, fewer than 30,000 Cybertrucks were sold and registered in the United States in the first nine months, according to data from Cox Automotive and Kelley Blue Book. In the first two quarters combined, 11,558 Cybertrucks were sold in the U.S., with the third quarter marking 16,692 registrations. The numbers are on the rise, so it will be very interesting to see what will happen in the last quarter–will the numbers go up or down? By the looks of it, Tesla managed to ramp up production significantly in the previous quarter, but if fewer people want the angular pickup, it makes sense to tone down the assembly line pace to avoid filling delivery centers with inventory.",Iulian Dnistran
Jaguar’s Electric Comeback Is Big And Bold. But Time Is Running Out,https://insideevs.com/news/742967/jaguar-type-00-business/,"The Jaguar Type 00 Concept is a $120,000 bold bet on EV power, but this brand is already on its ninth life. Can it pull off a comeback?",12/2/2024 20:10,"Jaguar’s title sponsorship of Miami Art Week featured its own blank canvas in the Type 00, a concept car the brand hopes will spawn some electric masterpieces beginning in 2026. Its design is remarkably striking, easily the most interesting thing Jaguar has done in years.
But design is one thing; making a business out of it is another, and Jaguar is running out of time.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The Miami venue underscored the brand’s intention to collaborate with artists, who aren’t known for buying roughly $120,000 EVs; but also to market to wealthy coastal types who might. Forget the gray U.K. or a gritty Detroit in January—that’s so 1960s. Forget British punters crying in their Guinness over classic E-Types. They’re ambivalent at best toward EVs, and probably can’t afford these cars anyway. JLR estimates only 10 to 15% of current customers will come along for the ride.
That brings us to the first of Jaguar’s problems and possibly the ninth of its lives: lately, Jaguar hasn’t had many customers at all. The brand sold 8,348 cars in America in 2023, down nearly 80 percent since 2017, and about 64,000 worldwide. Mercedes and BMW each sold about 40 times that many cars in the U.S. Its current lineup, if you can even call it that, is just holdovers from the previous decade like the once-groundbreaking but now irrelevant electric I-Pace.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
As company executives note, that has proven the folly of butting heads with BMW, Benz or even Genesis in the mass-luxury ranks. Blame whatever you like, a dodgy quality reputation, anodyne designs, a revolving door of ownership and strategies. That includes balling and tossing a near-completed electric XJ design, and $634 million with it.
These are valid diagnoses of an ailing brand. But I prefer a swipe with Occam’s Razor: Jaguar is a sedan and sports-car specialist in a world that has turned its back on sedans and sports cars. And Range Rover has the SUV-heritage-thing wrapped up, leaving scraps for its starveling sister.
Jaguar’s good old days are over, and its internal-combustion ways weren’t working. So the brand will shutter its factories, pretend 2025 isn’t a thing, and start fresh in 2026. Type 00 might refer to the revenues Jaguar will generate between now and then.
More seriously, U.S. dealers, their count already reduced to 120, will spend at least 12 months unloading a staggered inventory of leftovers, including the excellent but oft-overlooked F-Pace SUV. You think you’re peeved about Jaguar’s reimagining? I’m sure those long-suffering franchisees love to hear Jaguar tout posh new in-house stores to offer “immersive steps into the world of the Jaguar brand.” This red-hot industry trend, whose failures include a now-shuttered Cadillac House in Manhattan, has shown little to no evidence of boosting sales or brand image.
But at its Gaydon design studios, where I saw the Type 00 prior to the Miami reveal, Jaguar showed a rendering of a future store design: More shelter-magazine fantasy than traditional dealership, complete with a dramatic spiral staircase. Jaguar plans to open the first of these brand showcases in Paris’ “Golden Triangle” luxury-fashion district in the 8th arrondissement.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The question lingers: How many Parisians, Persians or Philadelphians will spend six figures on an electric Jaguar? As Rawdon Glover, managing director, confirmed in an interview, the brand plans to boost average transaction prices from today’s $60,000 to roughly $120,000.
Considering today’s option-stuffed luxury models, that to me suggests base prices closer to $100,000, which I believe Jaguar had better be targeting through ruthlessly disciplined design, supplier deals, and resource sharing. Much higher than that, and the air gets thin and customers are finicky and scarce—especially for an underdog like Jaguar.
Plot an industry sales chart based on prices, and you’ll be struck by how new-car sales tumble off a cliff above $100,000. That surprisingly small niche of buyers tends to head straight to blue-chip ICE perennials, your Porsche 911s, Mercedes G-Classes and S-Classes, a few BMWs. Oh, and Range Rovers.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Normally, if people don’t want your $60,000 cars, shooting for $120,000 sounds like madness. But these aren’t normal times. Like many legacy brands, Jaguar rightly sees its current fossil-fueled path as a dead-end. If you’re going to go down, you might as well go down swinging, with three chances to hit a home run or even a bloop single. The strategy appears simultaneously desperate, smart and necessary. The entire industry, including mainstream GM and Ford, has figured out it’s better to build fewer cars and charge much more for them, rather than go broke chasing volume and market share.
So Jaguar will aim for just 50,000 global sales, a fraction of the roughly 130,000 it sold under Ford’s high-volume auspices in 2002. Glover believes Jaguar can make money at those volumes, and finally carry its weight within JLR.
If Jaguar has a trump card, it’s Gerry McGovern, and his status as likely the industry’s most successful contemporary luxury designer and turnaround artist. McGovern basically hit reset on Land Rover after its own years in the wilderness. When you see people routinely paying $200,000 and more for top Range Rovers; and their sleek convoys on shows like Succession that have become a stereotypical visual shorthand for wealth and power, you can thank McGovern. Now running the entire JLR design show from a tastefully curated office in Gaydon, McGovern won’t be getting his hands dirty with Jaguar clay models, but nothing will reach showrooms without his signoff. And considering McGovern’s track record, I’m not ready to bet against him.
For all that, Jaguar may still be leaping from frying pan to fire.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
I can’t shake a suspicion that Jaguar is trying to locate an imaginary slice of the market where competition doesn’t exist, or will curl up in a ball when faced with Jaguar’s (purportedly) superior designs. When I asked Glover to name the brands or models Jaguar was benchmarking or viewed as rivals, he demurred; saying Jaguar had often spent too much time worrying about the competition and was better off playing its own confident game. Fair enough.
Yet at Gaydon, Glover and other execs took plenty of broad shots at today’s luxury EVs as being generic, cab-forward transportation pods, designed to satisfy wind tunnels rather than discerning eyes. (I’d say “Looking at you, Mercedes,” but I’m not telling them anything they don’t already know.)
In contrast, Jaguar’s distinctive, design-led models would stand out and carry the day. But even recently, Jaguar often boasted the sexiest cars in various segments—the XJ sedan, the F-Type sports car and F-Pace SUV—and a fat lot of good it did them. Jaguar needs to bring the performance, tech, quality, everything, and not just show up at the party with the sharpest suit and prettiest bouquet.
If Jaguar won’t breathe a few Voldemort names, I will: Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lucid to start. All of those brands, I humbly submit, have managed distinctive EV designs of their own. Then there’s Tesla, which will flip you a Model S Plaid for $89,900. The Tesla may not be as swanky as a future Jaguar, but it’s got 1,020 horsepower, will cost roughly $30,000 less.
And there are signs that the uber-wealthy would rather pay for the privilege of internal combustion.
Global sales of the Porsche Taycan, a benchmark luxury EV, have tumbled a whopping 50% in 2024, though the heavily updated 2025 models aren’t out in force yet. Mercedes’ EQS sedan, with base prices ranging from about $105,000 to $129,000, has failed to win over traditional Mercedes ICE customers or conquest new ones. Despite stellar performance and industry-leading range and efficiency, Lucid’s Air has not done what the Model S did for Tesla. If Porsche, Mercedes and Lucid are struggling in the EV stratosphere, what chance does Jaguar have?
Other nagging questions include the brand’s ability to make money with a standalone Jaguar Electric Architecture. Can Jaguar sell enough cars and share enough components with Range Rover to balance the books and justify that investment?
Jaguar is also failing to take a lesson from Lucid’s gravest mistake, which was coming to market with a sedan first and not a higher-volume SUV. Akin to Lucid, Jaguar says its sedan-shaped GT will establish a design language and underscore its electric bona fides. But Americans especially don’t care about high-minded philosophies; they just want SUVs.
To the good: Jaguar may be out of cars for now, but it’s not out of money, engineering and resources. And nearly every EV purveyor, legacy or start-up, is currently struggling to make a go of it. Lucid and Rivian have yet to earn a profit, and are burning through billions of dollars each quarter, with the Saudis and Amazon/Ford as their respective key financial patrons. At Ford, the F-Series is the real sugar daddy, that bankrolls and offsets an EV operation that’s losing billions.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar’s deep-pocketed patron is Tata Group, India’s mightiest conglomerate.  JLR itself posted record revenues of $36.3 billion in the last fiscal year. JLR’s $2.75 billion in profit is its highest since 2015. Wait, actual profits? Lucid’s Peter Rawlinson and Rivian’s RJ Scaringe would pop champagne at the very thought. Sure, Land Rover generates roughly 100 percent of those earnings. But Land Rover has been carrying Jaguar like a sickly kitten since Ford sold both brands to Tata 16 years ago. What’s a few more?
Finally, the Jaguar name still carries more recognition than any start-up. Among laypeople, I hear this all the time: What’s a Rivian? Lucid, you say? But people know Jaguar, for better or worse. Their doctor or neighbor once drove one. A mechanic told them they should never buy one. In this brand-obsessed culture, that three-syllable name—redolent of classic cars, fragrant leather, British royals, the gentrified good life—still has potential value. If this revival fails, I can see the brand being sold to a Chinese automaker just as BMW bought Britain’s foundering Rover Group in 1994, then broke it up and sold the Land Rover portion to Ford in 2000.
Something else is being overlooked. Jaguar appears on track to become the world’s first legacy luxury brand with an all-electric lineup, even as others backpedal from promises. For people who support EVs and the fight against climate change, wasn’t that the idea all along? So let’s go easy on the hot-pink outrage, reserve judgment for now, and maybe hope that this once-glorious brand can thrive again.
Jaguar’s electric transformation does appear to be the ultimate Hail Mary play. But teams draw it up for a reason: Every once in a while, it works.

I’m referring to the, um, “Exuberant” rebranding of this famed-yet-foundering British luxury automaker; complete with expressionless models whose ruched-and-ruffled attire and lunar-pink backdrop seemed equal parts Teletubbies and Dune. “Does Jaguar sell ketamine now?” Colbert quipped, noting the ad’s Infiniti-esque absence of cars.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Well, cue the EDM from Miami, because this brand isn’t through with provoking, or the color pink. Jaguar chose the city’s Art Week to unveil an actual car, the Type 00—a concept design statement that history may record as the inflection point for Jaguar’s EV renaissance. Or an epitaph.
The initial rebranding struck so many observers as Category 5 corporate wankery. But perspective, people: Almost nobody buys, or doesn’t buy, a car based on advertising. If they did, Volkswagen would rule America, and Lexus wouldn’t sell any cars until December. Tesla doesn’t even advertise, unless you consider Musk a walking advertisement. Which is certainly going well.
In the words of Gerry McGovern, JLR’s creative director, “Product is God.” And Jaguar does need a miracle. But it’s a long way between now and 2026 when the first of a planned three-car electric lineup goes on sale. Pouring a glass half-full, that’s bankrolled by Jaguar’s share of $19 billion from owner Tata Motors, in planned EV and autonomous investment in Jaguar and Land Rover over five years. With green capital drying up elsewhere, it’s the kind of money any EV start-up would kill for.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar says the Type 00 name alludes to zero emissions and a fresh start for an 89-year-old brand that once symbolized the best of British design. It’s a brawny two-seat fastback with faint echoes of those golden years, including a swept roofline, a boattail rear and a hood long enough to house a V-12, rather than a petite electric motor. As intended, this coupe appears carved from a single block of granite, albeit one with little room to spare for miniature windows. A freight-train front end recalls Audi’s original single-frame grilles, minus conventional openings.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The look is one part Streamline Moderne, one part armored vehicle. It's like a brutalist take on the Rolls-Royce Spectre, at barely one-quarter the price, minus the Rolls' traditional grille and graceful curvature.  But the exterior also looks unfinished, like a rough design sketch that’s come to life. Dramatic butterfly doors and three brass rails inside—including a 10.5-footer that splits the cabin between floating seats—clearly aren’t meant for production.
Then again, the screens that rise theatrically from the dash appear doable. A new Leaper logo is laser-etched onto brass fender “ingots” that deploy to expose rear-facing cameras. Gorgeous travertine stone inlays might win over buyers all on their own. Too bad the natural stone appears unfeasible: It’s the kind of bravura element that could back up Jaguar’s “Copy Nothing” mantra that traces to founder William Lyons.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The Type 00 does take an opaque page from the Polestar 4: There’s no rear window, rather a “glassless tailgate” and a camera-based rearview mirror. That offputting gimmick—something nobody ever wanted—appears headed to the first production car inspired by this concept, a four-seat, roughly $120,000 GT. You’re not going to make this easy, are you Jaguar?
Under-the-skin details remain scarce for that production model, beyond an 800-volt architecture and what Jaguar claims will deliver 430 miles of range on the EPA testing cycle. Jaguar has said it will be its most powerful road car ever, so we’re expecting output to top 575 horsepower. That GT is to be followed by an SUV in some form because they actually need to make some sales here, plus an electric super sedan that sounds like a more affordable Bentley Flying Spur or Rolls-Royce Ghost.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
To its credit, the Type 00 looks expensive, anchored by 23-inch wheels. But alluring roofline aside, it’s not traditionally “pretty,” lithe or elegant like Jags of old. And its blunt-force proportions and design pretensions will surely spark another round of handwringing from the easily outraged.
That includes the Type 00’s dusky shade of “Miami Pink” that I admired in November at JLR’s Gaydon, U.K. headquarters, during a hush-hush media showing prior to the official reveal. The rosy paint was a highlight for this careless coupe, seemingly designed for modern-day Daisy Buchanans to mow down peasants/pedestrians. In Miami’s Design District, Jaguar paired the pink car with a “London Blue” specimen.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
A literal whiff of fashionista does follow the “Prism,” a kind of magic handbag that tucks into the bodyside, behind a powered door panel. The Prism contains three “totems”—wedges of Alabaster, Travertine and Brass—that slot into the console to summon various moods in ambient lighting, soundscapes or bespoke fragrances. Silly? A bit. But for decades, these kinds of playful flourishes have been par for the concept course.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Screen animations use chiaroscuro, mixing light and shadow to suggest three-dimensional objects. Jaguar’s new “strikethrough” design hallmark traces front and rear ends, and tops a striking peekaboo roof that appears solid at first glance. Think a Venetian blind with gracefully thin slats.
Even if the initial rebranding exercise was the equivalent of two torn hamstrings, Jaguar has captured its biggest mindshare in years. With all eyes on Jaguar, expect some auto writers and armchair critics to continue the gleeful pile-on, and declare the Type 00 more evidence of a brand and electric transformation gone awry.
But concept cars don’t work that way. So many concepts or design elements that were declared “radical” or ridiculed, from those Audi front ends to BMW’s X6 “SUV coupe”, were soon accepted or even beloved by actual buyers. They became commonplace or spawned myriad imitators. Looking back, you wonder what the original fuss was all about.
So if you were expecting a definitive answer as to whether Jaguar can design its way out of trouble, the Type 00 is not it. We’ll all need to wait until this polarizing concept and design language evolves into showroom form. Jaguar plans to reveal that GT late next year and build it in the UK sometime in 2026. Then wealthy EV prospects, not Jaguar’s critics, will have the final say.

"Tesla's FSD Can Finally Park, Though Sometimes It Aims For The Sidewalk",https://insideevs.com/news/742973/tesla-fsd-new-version-improvements/,"Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" system can now back out of and find a parking spot, but it's far from flawless.",12/2/2024 18:06,"We’ve been covering Tesla Full Self-Driving since it was launched in October 2020. In the four years since we’ve seen it both working perfectly and failing, but true full self-driving with no safety driver just seemed distant. The latest version of FSD changes that, though, and it finally makes true driverless cars seem possible.
There have always been big claims made by Elon Musk about FSD and its capabilities, but the rate at which it was progressing made some of these statements seem exaggerated. What made us question FSD was Tesla’s decision to make the system only work on a combination of cameras and neural networks, ditching other types of sensors and radar.
FSD version 13.2 is a big improvement over version 12. It not only makes the autonomous driving better and smoother, but it also adds new features. You can now enable FSD while the car is in Park, and it will reverse out of the parking spot for you and begin its journey to your set destination where it will find a suitable spot to park itself.
Dirty Tesla drove around in his Model Y running FSD V13.2, and it worked well on the driving portion. But at its destination, the vehicle attempted to park on a sidewalk ramp. It looked big enough for a car to fit, in its defense, though it's hard to imagine a human making that mistake. However, that was one of the very few times when the FSD disengaged or the driver had to intervene. Still, it highlights a big problem for automated parking: Knowing where the car will fit is one thing, but knowing where it can legally park is an entirely different issue. It may be a long time before a Tesla can sort out what a loading zone is, what permit parking means, what permits it has and what spots are time-restricted.
It also failed to find a proper parking spot after the sidewalk situation, but its ability to navigate the parking lot is still impressive. It even had to squeeze through a tight gap between a parked car and a building, and it made it look easy. Don’t forget this is a car with no ultrasonic sensors to gauge distance, which only makes its performance more impressive. Though you can see why many automakers do use them.
One of the big changes with V13.2 is that it uses higher-resolution feeds from the exterior cameras, which also run at a higher refresh rate. This allows the AI model that underpins FSD to run faster, helped by the new Cortex supercomputer at Giga Texas, which is five times quicker at computing data compared to the older supercomputer called Dojo.
Another video where Dirty Tesla tests FSD V13.2 highlights just how smooth it is with steering and brake application. Early versions would saw the wheel as they made turns, which didn’t instill confidence. But now it seems to be getting close to matching a human driver’s level of smoothness. Note, however, that early reviews of FSD systems tend to be more positive, as Tesla has been known to prioritize data access to those with friendlier approaches to the system.
Such a big improvement in FSD’s performance makes Tesla’s robotaxi plans seem more plausible. The manufacturer intends to begin production of its Cybercab sometime in 2026 or 2027. I was doubtful when I originally heard that timeline, and I'm still unsure now. But now that FSD has the ability to start and end drives on its own terms—even with notable errors—that future feels closer than ever.

BYD Plans On Going The Distance In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/742961/byd-distance-video-stella-li/,"An exclusive interview with our Italian counterpart revealed that the brand sees tariffs, and a slowing European market as mere temporary setbacks.",12/2/2024 16:00,"BYD’s on everyone's lips now, and that’s a fact. This Chinese automaker once only made poorly-made gas-powered clones of Japanese sedans, pivoted to plug-in vehicles. Now, roughly 15 years later, BYD is one of the largest vehicle brands on the planet. Its plug-in vehicles are a stone’s throw away from catching Tesla in China, but it’s also been making huge inroads in Europe, despite pushback from EU tariffs meant to stifle Chinese brands from undercutting Europe’s own EV efforts.
Still, BYD’s pushing forward, and we’ve got some more information as to just how BYD itself might feel both about China and as it expands outward into other markets.
Stella Li, the Vice President of BYD Global, sat down with our colleague Alessandro Lago, Motorsport Network’s Automotive Editorial Director for Europe. The two had a wide-ranging 30-minute chat the brand’s successes, its headwinds in the global market, where it plans to go next and whether people are ready for electric vehicles.
“If you’re not prepared for long-term investment in Europe, you should never come to Europe. It’s not simple. It’s super challenging. It’s super competitive,” Li said.
Li said she certainly feels that the world is increasingly ready for electrification. Globally, BYD holds 23% of all of the world’s plug-in vehicle market (often called NEV, or New Energy Vehicles), which Li says is double the percentage of its next closest rival. Of course, that’s a stunning achievement, but Li also insists that the popularity of BYD’s models points to a market willingness for EVs and PHEVs. Thus, its successes at home have emboldened harder to push more into Europe.
BYD Seal U
One of those pushes includes BYD’s forthcoming Seal U PHEV crossover. This car, already on sale in China as the BYD Song Plus, is set to come to many European markets, slotting in as a crossover counterpart to the Seal EV sedan. Li says the Seal U will have at least 80 kilometers (50 miles) of full EV range, which she thinks will be a game-changer for Europeans, and be the start of BYD boosting its sales in Europe.
“I think you’ll see a big change in the European market,” Li said. Still, despite BYD making inroads, Li admitted that there aren’t enough dealers and aftersales service centers for the models in continental Europe, and it needs to build more. For example, BYD only has 20 stores in Italy—but it plans on having 105 dealerships in Italy by the end of next year.
Those sound like a lot of stores, especially since in some cases the EV infrastructure and revolution is faltering as of late. Sales can be interpreted as slowing. Legacy brands like Volkswagen, Ford and Fiat have been very open about slow-selling EVs hurting profitability and are the reason for shuttering factories.
Li says this is only temporary. In fact, the lull is pretty natural. “When you’re pushing a new technology, growth is fast growing, but then you’ll pause—[demand] will snap back,” Li said.
She also thinks that confusing messaging from legacy EU brands and government, some of which have reneged on their promises to move 100% electrification, have hurt sales. Add in high energy costs in some EU member states, and there’s a perfect storm for EV sales to lull in Europe despite the potential to market willingness.
BYD is dedicated to Europe, even the EU and China tariff spat will likely be resolved soon, and collaboration will continue. BYD’s European production plans (like its factory soon to open in Hungary) will continue.

"Fisker Ocean Owner Review: $69,012 To $13,500 In One Year",https://insideevs.com/news/742945/fisker-ocean-owner-review-depreciation/,"Fisker owners have to deal with massive financial losses, an unfinished car and plenty of unfulfilled promises.",12/2/2024 15:00,"Edmunds just wrapped up a 10-month test of the Fisker Ocean, and boy was it expensive. The auto buying site purchased the top-trim Ocean for $69,012. After 10 months that included Fisker filing for bankruptcy, the car is now worth $13,500. That hurts.
Watching Edmunds' latest video on the Fisker, it's not hard to see why. The brand's editors describe a litany of issues that they assumed would get better over time. But with Fisker now effectively defunct, there's little hope it'll get any better. With almost no spare parts out there and only a crowdsourced patchwork of support options, it may actually get worse.
That's tough when starting from such a low baseline. From the beginning, the Ocean has struggled to detect its keyfob. Senior Reviews Editor Brian Wong says it frequently fails to recognize an unlock command even after holding the button for 15-20 seconds. The car also occasionally won't detect the key once he gets inside, and it won't start until the issue resolves itself. Staffers couldn't carry a backup key, either, as the Ocean only came with one fob. The company promised that a mobile app was on the way to provide an alternative access method, but it never did. Now, it never will. There are plenty of other software issues that Edmunds editors and buyers alike were expecting to get fixed.
""We were really counting on those updates to sort of fix those things as we went along,"" Wong said.

The car still rolls backwards on hills when you let off the brake, he said. It was supposed to have a hill start function from the get-go. But it never worked. Fisker said an auto-brake-hold function was coming in software version 2.0, but Edmunds' vehicle never got it. Editors also complained of a laggy, low-resolution backup camera. There was enough of a delay that you might not see an object before you hit it, one staffer noted.
It wasn't all bad news, though. The Fisker looks good and rides well, with an exceptional maximum range. In Edmunds' range test, the Ocean delivered 358 miles of range in mixed city/highway conditions. That's fantastic for a mid-size electric SUV. Plus, people loved the California mode, which allows you to drop all of the glass behind the windshield, including the panoramic roof, the small window behind the C pillar and the rear glass. I often see a Fisker Ocean at my local surf break in California mode, with a surfboard sticking out of the back. The advertisement writes itself.
But unfortunately, there's no one left to buy an ad spot. Fisker is bankrupt, leaving its owners in the lurch. Edmunds took an 80% hit on this car, losing $55,512 in less than a year. The company buys these cars to get a true ownership experience. For Fisker owners, there's only one way to describe it: Brutal.

A Tesla Gets Much Better With These Stick-On Stalks,https://insideevs.com/news/742935/tesla-stick-on-stalks/,"Hardly anybody thinks Tesla giving up on indicator and wiper stalks is a good idea, but now there’s an aftermarket fix.",12/2/2024 13:03,"When I drove the refreshed Tesla Model 3, I was impressed with its blend of qualities and the improvements it had over the pre-facelift model. However, not all changes were for the better, and Tesla removing the stalks from behind the steering wheel was cause for some initial frustration.
The revised Model 3 no longer has indicator and wiper stalks behind the steering wheel. The Model S and Model X haven’t had stalks since 2021; the Cybertruck never even had them. All the controls that were previously accessed via the stalks have now been moved to either the steering wheel or the touchscreen. This includes turn signals, lights, wipers and gear selection. (Thankfully, the ultra-popular Model Y keeps them, at least for now.)
The turn signals are two buttons on the left spoke of the steering wheel stacked one on top of the other. Using them takes more thought than it should, especially when you need to indicate when the wheel isn’t centered. Tesla also forces users to put the car in drive or reverse by swiping on the screen, and while this isn’t as annoying as not having an indicator stalk, it’s not great.
One way around this would be to retrofit the stalks from an older Tesla, but they don’t look right (they stick out too much), and you need extensive modifications to make them work. That’s why a solution like the S3XY stalks by Enhance seems ideal for Model 3 owners who miss having stalks and who don’t want to start taking the car apart (and risk voiding the warranty) to get physical stalks to work.
Tesla Stalks Aftermarket
You just stick them on the sides of the steering column, and they communicate wirelessly to a command module that is hooked into the car’s OBD port. If you just want the left or the right stalk, you can just have one or opt for the pair to get additional functions. You can customize what they do and even map shortcuts, choosing from 60 available actions, which differ depending on the model they’re installed on.
The pack containing the two stalks, the wireless command module, and the necessary wiring to make it work cost €409.69 ($429), and the company is currently offering 22% off for a limited time. It will begin shipping kits next year. The ones designed for the Model 3 will be shipped first, starting on Feb. 24, while those for the Model S and X (which are €20 more expensive) will begin shipping in late April.

Stellantis' CEO Is Gone Ahead Of 'A Big Year' With A Huge List Of Problems,https://insideevs.com/news/742900/tavares-stellantis-december-cm/,"Plus, a recent Mercedes fire changes South Korea's EV calculus, and can the Trump administration work with China's automakers?",12/2/2024 10:30,"I think now-former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares was an interesting figure for just how unpopular he was. Sure, very few top executives get to where they are by making friends everywhere they go. But Tavrares was somewhat unique in how much he managed to make everyone mad at him; the employees, the unions, the board members, the suppliers and the customers are all probably thrilled to see him go. That's almost a talent in and of itself.
But Tavares was also the chief architect behind Stellantis, the bizarre conglomerate formed in a merger of Fiat Chrysler with France's Groupe PSA. What that company and its 14 car brands even are without him is an open question, and it comes right ahead of a crucial year on many fronts—including the electric one.
That kicks off the first Critical Materials news roundup of December 2024. We at InsideEVs hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, if you observed it. Also on today's docket: a Mercedes-Benz EV fire forces some big changes in South Korea, and can President-elect Donald Trump ""open up"" China's EV sector?
Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO
It's hard to believe this, but we're not even four full years into the existence of the entity that is Stellantis, the cross-Atlantic holding company that owns Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Opel, Fiat and a bunch of other brands. That's a lot of mouths to feed; I'm not even sure it can be done. But now Tavares, the former CEO of the PSA Group, is completely out even before his planned early 2026 retirement.
Stellantis was formed on the idea that the car industry was facing a profound transformation the only way to survive it is through scale: combining the resources of these many brands to keep costs down and drive investments in the future. And maybe things would have gone differently if COVID-19 hadn't blown up the automotive supply chain and raised car prices, though Tavares' leadership is absolutely guilty of taking that and running with it.
In the end, Tavares' tenure was doomed on two fronts. He was dealing with the European auto crisis on his home turf—falling sales, increased competition from Chinese car brands and waning EV interest as subsidies vanished—and plummeting revenue in the lucrative North American market as people stopped buying these newly ultra-expensive Jeeps and Ram trucks. This side of the Atlantic paid more than half Stellantis' bills but Tavares' team was roundly accused of jacking up prices and starving Jeep and others of new products to fuel a renaissance for certain European brands like Alfa Romeo, which didn't work out, either. Now it's facing existential problems like plant closures, furious dealers and an unclear strategy for what's next. Profits were down nearly 50% this year as 2024 was set to be a kind of total write-off.
The thing is—and don't take this as a defense of Tavares, because I have no interest in constructing one—some positive changes were beginning to take shape. Jeep has a new CEO who's working to make its prices less unhinged and get new models on the road, and Stellantis is starting to show some real promise on the EV front after years of lagging behind. But in the end, it wasn't enough to save Tavares and he probably didn't deserve it anyway.
So now what? For one, there's the matter of succession. But as The Detroit News pointed out, Stellantis has a pretty thin bench these days; it witnessed a huge executive talent drain under Tavares and will be run by a committee in the interim, not an acting CEO. And Stellantis has a huge year ahead: it's supposed to launch the Dodge Charger EV, the electric Jeep Wagoneer S, the Ram 1500 Rev and Ramcharger EREV and more next year. That's just on the North American front; more are coming in Europe too. There are new EVs coming from Fiat, Peugeot, that deal with China's Leapmotor... a lot is going on right now.
From the News:
In North America, where revenue fell 42% in the third quarter and shipments were off 36%, it appears Stellantis has a ""decent plan"" for a turnaround, said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Inc.
""It's a matter of letting it play out,"" she said. ""They were making progress on adjusting pricing. They're making progress on not just making things cheaper, but trying to come up with a way to repackage and develop products that are giving consumers the right value.”
Next year, Stellantis needs to move forward with the several products it's launching — including high-profile EV offerings — and ensure those launches go as smoothly as possible, she said: “It's going to be a big year for them, and they need to have it go as smoothly as possible, and that means being able to handle whatever unexpected issues come up as well as possible.”
Good luck to whoever ends up in that job. They're going to need it.
Mercedes EQS
Here's the thing about lithium-ion battery fires: they're statistically far more rare than internal combustion vehicles, but far nastier to put out when they do happen. This is especially bad news in South Korea, a country with big EV ambitions but where most urban people live in high-rise towers. One Mercedes-Benz EV fire earlier this year (followed by another involving a Kia) has the country spooked about what could happen if these cars are parked underground. That Mercedes fire alone sent dozens of tower residents to the hospital and left 200 families temporarily homeless.
So now, according to Bloomberg, South Korea is making changes that the rest of the world should consider adopting:
The new set of regulations included mandating automakers disclose the brands of their batteries, expanding the scope of safety inspections for existing EVs and preventing vehicles from being fully charged.
The government has also directly stepped in to ensure the safety of batteries via a state-run certification system. The pilot project has been running since mid-October with five companies, including carmakers Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp. as well as cell manufacturer LG Energy Solution Ltd., participating.
[...] Before the initiative, EVs were sold in South Korea without any third-party safety tests. Under the new system, state-run agencies like the Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute will put batteries through their paces before installation, ensuring they meet government-backed safety certification standards.
Korea planted its flag early in the EV space and these days, it seems like every fourth or fifth car in Seoul is an electric Hyundai or Kia. The country doesn't want to back down after all those investments, so these should be seen as positive moves:
The Mercedes-Benz blaze was undoubtedly an unfortunate event, but it cast a much-needed spotlight on the issue and sparked calls for stricter regulations. Ultimately, it could serve as a wake-up call for South Korea to create a safer, more supportive environment for battery-powered cars.
Here's hoping.
Trump BYD Seagull
Meanwhile, back in the U.S., the auto industry and buyers like are on pins and needles as they wait to see if incoming President Donald Trump will really act to kill the EV tax credit or if he's inclined to find some way forward that won't threaten manufacturing jobs in purple and red states. But there's also the question of China's automakers—currently kept out of the U.S. by tariffs and software restrictions—and what role they could play domestically. Trump has said in the past that he'd rather they build cars in the U.S. than overseas: “If they want to build a plant in Michigan, in Ohio, in South Carolina, they can, using American workers,” he said in March.
That's undoubtedly a scary proposition if you're Ford, or General Motors, or Volkswagen, or heck, even Tesla. But Steve LeVine at The Information (subscription required) proposes that Chinese EVs could come stateside as part of a broader trade deal with the country:
Yet there is reason to expect that Trump—after starting with maximal threats, like a 60% tariff he has vowed to impose on all Chinese goods—will favor a grand trade bargain in which the establishment of Chinese EV and battery factories in the U.S. would be a central feature. In exchange for that and other sweeteners to lower the U.S.-China trade imbalance, Beijing would seek reduced tariffs.
The reason: Trump, while unpredictable and prone to reversing course, would rightly view the potential for billions of dollars in investment, thousands of jobs and an improbable diplomatic breakthrough as a dealmaking coup that would burnish his legacy. For his part, President Xi Jinping “wants Chinese companies to dominate global markets in EVs and batteries,” said Ian Bremmer, president of geopolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “Call it the Japanese model of the ’80s and ’90s. Global domination requires a global presence.”
So could this actually work out for the U.S.? In terms of upping its battery game, which badly needs to happen, the answer could be yes:
[...] the U.S. could unroll a welcome mat to Chinese factories a win as long as a company like BYD, China’s largest EV manufacturer, sourced most of its parts and materials from North America and shared its technical knowledge with his American employees. “I think it is in the interests of the U.S. to onshore the dominant Chinese EV maker,” he said. “An investment like this supports the build-out of an onshore EV ecosystem from critical minerals production and recycling to battery manufacturing and charging network development.”
But then again:
Now Trump has invited Chinese EV makers into the U.S., and part of that bargain would likely be that they share what they know with American rivals. “In a complete role reversal from the ’00s, when foreign [automakers] wishing to access the growing Chinese market were concerned about forced tech transfer, it is now Beijing at risk of inadvertently undermining its companies in international markets by helping competitors catch up,” said Bremmer, the Eurasia Group president.
The deal is likely to be only the beginning: CATL, Byd and other Chinese companies make most of the world’s LFP batteries, and U.S. LFP startups haven’t even begun to manufacture them. Depending on the arrangement Trump offers, CATL seems likely to seek other business in the U.S.—and to get a warm welcome from automakers seeking the cheapest and currently the best batteries. “The United States does not have [LFP] experts,” a CATL engineer said. “The Chinese industry can help build that local talent pool.”
That story's worth a read in full. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Big Oil also have Trump's ear more than most, so it's also hard to fathom he'll become deeply interested in competitive battery technology all of a sudden.
Ralph Gilles Stellantis Jeep Wagoneer S
I've always been a fan of Ralph Gilles, the Chrysler-Fiat Chrysler-SRT-Stellantis design guru who's as responsible as anyone for America's 21st-century muscle car renaissance (and gets where the EV market is going.) He's a smart guy. But he may be too smart to want to take on that many brands.
Who should get the top spot at Stellantis next, and what must they do to right the ship?

Rivian Was Inspired By Anime And ‘Optimism’ To Transform Car Controls,https://insideevs.com/news/742830/rivian-software-artwork-hammoud-interview/,In-car software looks awful. Rivian’s latest updates to the 2025 R1S and R1T fix that problem in a unique and even philosophical way.,12/2/2024 10:00,"As crucial as things like touchscreens and software are to the modern automotive experience, we seldom stop to ask why everything looks so ugly.
Your average car’s touchscreen and menus likely have all the functionality of a Palm Pre, with the aesthetic appeal and artistic value of a Fort Worth outlet mall. Their menus and controls often feel haphazardly designed and look utterly forgettable. This is true even after more than a decade of in-car screen dominance and a future we’re constantly told is centered around over-the-air updates and smartphone-like tech features.
So when Rivian set out to completely overhaul its in-car software experience, its designers declared that things don’t have to be this way.
The electric startup’s latest infotainment setup features cel-shaded depictions of its trucks and SUVs, offset by animated depictions of different landscapes, bright colors, speed lines like you’d find in a Japanese manga comic and tons of “Easter eggs” in the backgrounds. New updates even give the software “costumes” inspired by classic TV shows and movies like Back to the Future and Knight Rider.
When I asked Rivian’s Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud why his team went this route, one word came up again and again: “Optimism.”
“We felt it was an opportunity to have a little bit of fun and create a personality around the car,” Hammoud said in a recent interview. More than that, he said, the new software interfaces reflect a philosophy inside Rivian. “We want it all to look inviting,” Hammoud said. “Our vehicles have a friendly look and that’s part of our brand… that optimism around what we're trying to do through electrification and protecting the world for our kids.”
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
Rivian’s new interface language went live this summer on the heavily updated 2025 R1S and R1T models and via software updates to earlier cars. They give owners an animated representation of their vehicle that spins and transforms as they adjust things like ride height settings and the various driving modes.
On another car, switching to sport mode might mean a new set of gauges on the central display or shifting the menus to a red color scheme. But on an R1S or R1T, a cartoon depiction of the car zooms onto what looks like a race track as its glowing taillights fade into a red-and-white background. Instead of pop-ups to confirm you’re in “Snow Mode” or some off-road setting, Rivian offers a shift to a charming winter landscape or the vehicle perched atop a rocky mountain. Clouds, windmills and birds move about in the backgrounds and all of these visuals take on a different character at night as well.

None of this is vital for a car to function properly, of course, and it’s highly unlikely that these animated graphics will be a make-or-break selling point. But they add a ton of something intangible—character—to Rivian’s cars, and they turn something that used to be an afterthought at best into something you actually look forward to using. And Hammoud said that a ton of effort went into devising how this ecosystem should look and feel.
“We used this idea of manga-style [or] Studio Ghibli films, those really optimistic movies where you feel like you're in another world, and really taking that into a style where we could create the different worlds of the drive modes,” Hammoud said. He’s of course referring to the famed Japanese animated classics from Hayao Miyazaki and other creators like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and, most recently, The Boy and the Heron. All of those are landmark animated films released to international acclaim. But Hammoud said they also share the general vibe Rivian is going for these days.
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
“You look at something like Akira, versus Studio Ghibli,” he said, referring to the 1980s comic and landmark animated film about a dystopian future. The latter is “a little bit more optimistic and on the friendly side of that. We want to communicate power and dynamism with the vehicle, but we still wanted to have this sort of, ‘sitting down Sunday morning watching cartoons with your kids’ vibe with it as well.”
That stands in stark contrast with another eye-catching electric vehicle designed that has a distinctly apocalyptic energy: hard angles, allegedly bulletproof stainless steel, a “Bioweapon Defense Mode.” While Hammoud didn’t mention it by name, he made clear that he, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe and their design teams didn’t share the same philosophy.
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
“When you look at trucks, their faces are very aggressive, very angry, like the front ends could eat small children,” Hammoud said. “Purposely, we're like, ‘All right, well, we don't need a big grill.’ We want it to look inviting. Look at our headlight shapes. Our vehicles have a friendly look.”
Much of this was afforded by the power of the Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics software system made famous in video games that’s now making its way to the automotive world. This allowed Rivian’s artists and designers to “scale” all these new images easily without having to draw each one individually.
“It was really important to us that whatever car you have, it’s the right set of wheels and it's the right color [on the screen], so that way we're looking at is actually representative of your vehicle,” Hammoud said. “If we had to create, which is what we did in the past, an image for every single [Rivian color or option], that’s thousands and thousands of images.”
With the Unreal Engine, Hammoud said, “You put in the specifications of the vehicle, like if it's a Forest Green car with 22s, you just put that into the code, and boom, it's rendered and it updates.”
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
Rivian isn’t alone in trying to add a more distinctive look and character to its software experience as well as its exterior designs. Mini recently added a cartoon dog to its infotainment systems as an AI-powered virtual assistant, and several Chinese automakers are taking similar approaches. And as with those cars, Rivian’s approach goes beyond mere visuals; these functions represent new ways for drivers to interact with their cars and control their features in the software-driven vehicle era.
So does it work? Based on a recent test of a 2025 Rivian R1S, I think the answer is mostly yes. It’s fairly easy to find the functions you want and the big, bright displays represent novel ways of presenting information to the driver. That’s crucial since Rivian famously—or perhaps infamously—eschews most physical buttons and Apple CarPlay in its EVs. It also aims to do more with voice controls, although it has a ways to go there to match many competitors.
But this approach to software does show what Rivian’s made of, and why a traditional conglomerate like the Volkswagen Group sees such value in what the company does. That 2025 R1S got better while I had it, receiving an over-the-air software update that improved the energy and efficiency gauges (and put them in line with the rest of the car’s new artistic language) while correcting some issues with the stereo and adding the Halloween-themed visuals.
And until Rivian can get the upcoming R2, R3 and R3X models on the road, it’s got more in store for its current cars both through software updates and more tweaks—though Hammoud was cagey about what exactly is coming next.
“We have some new updates that are coming next year on R1 that I'm excited to share, some special editions,” Hammoud said. “I'll leave it at that.”

The Porsche Macan Electric Is Being Recalled Because Its Headlights Are Too Bright,https://insideevs.com/news/742893/porsche-macan-electric-ev-recall-headlights/,"The fix doesn’t require new parts, thankfully. But you'll still need to schedule a service visit.",12/2/2024 8:19,"The electric Porsche Macan has been on sale in the United States for two months, and now there’s already a recall with its name on it. Thankfully, there’s no need for spare parts and it’s not the kind of recall that deals with flapping body panels.
However, despite this being a software-related problem, owners will still need to go to a Porsche service center to get it sorted out. That’s because the headlights are too bright and the headlight control unit software will need to be reprogrammed to comply with federal regulation. And that can't be done via an over-the-air update.
As per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the upper beams on certain Macan Electric models aren’t calibrated properly and may shine too bright, which could reduce visibility for incoming drivers and thus increase the risk of a crash. Due to a software data set error, the affected vehicles were programmed from the factory after the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) specs, whereas U.S.-spec vehicles need to conform to the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).
More Porsche Stuff
In total, 2,941 Porsche Macan Electric built between March 15, 2024, and November 4, 2024, are affected by the recall. Cars assembled after November 18 were shipped with the correct headlight software that complies with FMVSS No. 108.
The fix for the affected EVs is free of charge. Porsche will notify dealers on December 11, while owners will be notified on January 24, 2025.
The Porsche Macan Electric is sold alongside the gas-powered model in the United States. In Europe, however, the combustion-powered version has been retired due to new cybersecurity regulations and not because of tightening emissions regulations.
Stateside, the most affordable Macan Electric starts at $75,300, but in traditional Porsche fashion, one could double the price tag relatively easily by going down the (very) long options list.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Buy A Knockoff NACS To CCS Adapter,https://insideevs.com/news/742873/nacs-to-ccs-dc-to-dc-adapter-cheap-vs-expensive/,"It might look the same as a product from a more established company on the outside, but it’s a different story inside.",12/2/2024 6:14,"Almost every car manufacturer that sells electric vehicles in the United States will get access to Tesla’s expansive Supercharger network of DC fast chargers. New models will come out of the factory gates with Tesla’s NACS plug starting next year, but owners of existing EVs will have to use an adapter to top up at Superchargers across the United States and Canada.
As a result, there’s a growing number of companies out there that are selling NACS to CCS DC fast charging adapters. But as always, not all of them are created equal and the devil is in the details.
For starters, you should know that automakers’ stance on using third-party adapters is simple: don’t use one. Ford, Rivian, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and all the others claim they won’t repair a vehicle under warranty if something went wrong during a charging session where a non-approved adapter was used.
More Charging Stories
That said, you might not want to pay hundreds of dollars for an approved product and instead go for the cheaper, knockoff version. Save a couple of bucks and be done with it. They look roughly the same as the more established units out there, so why bother? Well, as you’ll see in the Auto Buyers Guide video below, you might want to hold off on that no-name purchase.
Safety is the name of the game here. Most well-regarded DC-to-DC charging adapters are rated at 1,000 volts and 500 amps, which comes out to 500 kilowatts. That’s a lot of power to go through a hand-held device, so some temperature monitoring is required.
Both the Tesla-supplied NACS to CCS adapter and the Lectron-made unit come with a pair of thermal sensors that cut off the flow of electricity if the temperature of the power pins exceeds 185 degrees (85 degrees Celsius). The sensors are placed right next to the pins and, when triggered, send a command to the communications pin to end the charging session. The same happens when pressing the unlatch button–there’s a contact inside that sends a signal to end the flow of electricity.
The DC pins are massive on these units. They’re also made out of copper and coated with silver to improve conductivity.
As for the cheap knockoff adapters, things are slightly different, in a bad way. The unit that was disassembled in the video had two temperature sensors, just like the Lectron adapter, but the wires were just dangling inside the housing. They were not firmly placed next to the DC pins, so if they were to get very hot, the sensors would not cut off the flow of electricity and the adapter housing could melt. Furthermore, the power pins themselves are slimmer than on the more expensive products and they’re plated with tin, not silver, so the conductivity is smaller.
An interesting discovery after tearing apart a couple of these adapters is that neither the charging provider nor the car manufacturer has any way of knowing what type of adapter is being used. There’s no communication between the adapter and the car or between the charging stall and the adapter–the thermal sensors and latch contacts are just cutoff switches.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares Quits Amid Strategy Dispute,https://insideevs.com/news/742850/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-resignation/,"UAW boss Shawn Fain, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the move is “a major step in the right direction.”",12/2/2024 3:14,"Carlos Tavares has suddenly resigned from his position as Chief Operating Officer at Stellantis, one of the largest car manufacturers in the world. The decision was announced yesterday evening and the board of directors has already accepted Tavares’ resignation.
Stellantis has created an Interim Executive Committee which will effectively do Tavares’ job until a new CEO is appointed “within the first half of 2025.” Board of Directors chairman John Elkman leads the IEC.
Previously, Tavares, who has acted as CEO since Stellantis’ creation in 2021, said he would stick to his role in the company until his mandate ended in early 2026. The comments came after Stellantis acknowledged it was looking for a successor to him.
More Stellantis Stories
Bloomberg wrote that Tavares’ sudden resignation came after a dispute with the board over how to turn the tides on weakening sales and a stock slump. In the third quarter, Stellantis reported a 27% drop in revenue and a 20% decline in shipments globally. In North America, the picture is even bleaker, with shipments down 36%.
Earlier this year, the automaker announced it would sell its massive Arizona proving grounds by the end of the year as a cost-cutting measure. Slow sales have also prompted Stellantis to pause the production of several models around the world, including the venerable Fiat Panda, electric Fiat 500e, Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee. The launch of the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and the range-extended Ram 1500 Ramcharger has also been delayed.
Maserati, the conglomerate’s highest-priced brand, is bleeding money, and Alfa Romeo, a staple of the Italian auto industry, is having a rough time appealing to American consumers–the Giulia sedan was the slowest-selling car in the U.S. in September, according to an analysis by CarEdge. Chrysler, meanwhile, is trying to survive with just one model in its lineup, the Pacifica minivan.
Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the decision is “a major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.”",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybercab: We Sit Inside Tesla's Driverless Car,https://insideevs.com/news/742776/tesla-cybercab-walkaround-interior-video/,"We climbed into the Tesla Cybercab, a two-seater with fully autonomous driving that could perhaps one day give life to the Model 2.",12/1/2024 12:00,"Editor's note: Our colleagues at Motor1 Italy had the chance to check out the Cybercab in person. They also had a rare opportunity to sit inside a Cybercab. The text that follows highlights their experience with the Tesla Cybercab.
Tesla has taken its Cybercab on a tour of Europe. Elon Musk's new self-driving vehicle has crossed the Atlantic Ocean, so we went to London to get a closer look at what it looks like. Not so much outside, since we had already gotten an idea of what it looked like during last month's unveiling, but inside.
We opened the doors, which lift upward with a butterfly opening and sat inside to get a sense of what it feels like to be in a car that, we'll say it now, has no steering wheel or pedals.
The Cybercab was designed from the outset for robotaxi service, and as you get on board, you get a clear sense of the priorities the designers have set for themselves. Not so much the fact that there is, as mentioned, no steering wheel or pedals, but the fact that the car is essential in every way.
The Tesla Cybercab seen in person
The dashboard, as on other Teslas on the road, is flat and horizontal. Everything revolves around the large central screen that will most likely be used to set the destination, look at the route, watch a movie, or listen to music while on the road. But touchscreen aside, the seats intrigue me the most.
More Cybercab Info
The Cybercab has only two seats. That's because it is expected to carry one or at most two people on most of the rides it will make. The seats are not wraparound. They are wide with flat backs. They look more like home chairs than ""automotive"" objects. The Cybercab will move exclusively in an urban environment and does not need contoured sides for body restraint during sideways acceleration.
There is only a central armrest between the two seats, and underneath are two cup holders. Stop: there is nothing else. This is intentional to keep costs down, but also for another reason. Tesla's idea is that these Cybercabs can use automatic sanitizing stations between rides. To ensure that all users can sit in a clean and sanitized cabin.
The seats look like two lounge chairs. Upholstered in leatherette, they are easily washable

EVs Help Vehicle Emissions Drop To Historic Low In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/742785/evs-phevs-bring-emissions-down-record-lows/,"EVs and PHEVs brought huge climate wins for the transportation sector in 2023. Emissions are down, fuel economy levels are up.",12/1/2024 10:00,"Fully electric and hybrid vehicles are helping America reduce greenhouse gas emissions to record levels, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a newly published report this week. EVs are not only helping bring down harmful carbon dioxide emissions but are also increasing fleetwide fuel economy rates to record highs.
Transportation accounts for the highest share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Fifty-seven percent of the transportation sector’s emissions come from light-duty vehicles, as per the EPA. Tailpipe emissions have been labeled as public health hazards and are directly linked to respiratory illnesses and lung diseases.
Now a combination of pro-EV regulatory framework, compliance by automakers and increasing adoption from consumers is helping turn the tide. The real-world new-vehicle CO2 emissions dropped to a record low of 319 grams per mile for MY2023 vehicles, an 18-point reduction compared to the previous model year vehicles.
Fleetwide fuel-economy levels for new vehicles reached a record 27.1 miles per gallon, a 1.1 mpg increase compared to the year before. The EPA said increased production of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models significantly influenced these trends. Automakers sold a record 1.1 million EVs and PHEVs in 2023. That number is expected to grow when 2024 sales numbers are out early next year.
Without EVs and hybrids, emissions would have risen to 357 grams per mile and fuel efficiency would have stagnated at 24.9 mpg.
So, who are the good and the bad actors? Tesla has been the manufacturer with the highest fuel economy since 2016 when it began mass production of the Model 3 sedan. That’s unsurprising because Tesla only makes fully electric models. However, according to EPA data, Stellantis has manufactured the dirtiest cars since 2015. Both automakers will remain in the same spots in 2024, as per a preliminary estimate.
Every major automaker witnessed a drop in their real-world CO2 emissions among new vehicles sold, except Honda and Toyota. The most significant year-over-year emissions drops came from Mercedes-Benz (-68 g/mi), BMW (-39 g/mi), Kia (-17 g/mile) and Nissan (-17 g/mile). And the largest fuel economy improvements were also from these brands.
The EPA added that SUVs are now cleaner than sedans, as they’re increasingly electrified and automakers sell more of them. The category now accounts for the lowest average new-vehicle CO2 emissions as electric SUVs accounted for 36% of all MY2023 SUVs sold. Their fuel economy also has been increasing the most over the years.
“This report provides a critical data-driven affirmation that strong, technology-neutral standards can underpin environmental progress while saving drivers money at the pump,” EPA Administrator Michael S Regan said in a statement. “Manufacturers continue to innovate and are bringing technologies to market which will directly improve air quality, better protecting people’s health and saving lives.”

"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,12/25/2024 1:26,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

Here Are All The EVs And Hybrids That Qualify For A Tax Credit In 2024 (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/702784/ev-tax-credit-2024-official/,"The tax credit for EVs provides up to $7,500 toward a purchase of a qualifying Tesla, Rivian or other plug-in car.",12/1/2024 7:20,"A year ago, nearly every new electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid on the market qualified for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, provided it was manufactured in North America. But the rules changed in a major way in 2024. The new year brings big restrictions on which EVs and hybrids get the tax break as the U.S. looks to crack down on battery components sourced from China.
In other words, if you were banking on a tax credit to help get you into a new electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid for 2024, your list of choices is now smaller and less straightforward than before. Still, $7,500 is serious money. It could make the difference between buying and not buying an electric car—so it's key to which vehicles are eligible for the tax credit for EVs in 2024.
Plus, as automakers launch new models and change up their supply chains to comply with the new rules over time, we should see many more cars qualify. The list has already grown this year, with popular cars like the Tesla Model 3 Long Range regaining eligibility after a short hiatus. So we'll be sure to keep this list updated with the latest news.
Here's the full list of eligible EVs from FuelEconomy.gov, where you can also check if a certain car qualifies from its VIN:
And here's the list of qualifying plug-in hybrids:
Definitely not a huge list. And one that's missing some heavy hitters like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-E. So what gives here, exactly? That requires a bit of a history lesson.
The longstanding EV tax credit was revised and modernized as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022. That legislation had a number of goals—including possibly conflicting ones—like encouraging local manufacturing and lessening China's iron grip on the battery supply chain. (The tax credits also have limits based on a buyer's annual income and the price of the vehicle in question to keep these from just being luxury gifts to wealthy drivers.)
The new credits went into effect in January of last year. But over the subsequent months, the list of qualifying vehicles became narrower and narrower, prioritizing batteries and battery components made in North America as well. Now, the rules stipulate that starting in 2024 any vehicle containing battery components from what the government calls a ""foreign entity of concern"" will be excluded from receiving tax credits. The so-called ""FEOC"" rules pretty much directly target China, and given that country's utter dominance of the battery supply chain, a lot of new cars get left out.
On the plus side, it's crucial to note that leasing will still get you the full tax credit regardless of where the car was made, a loophole that has greatly benefitted foreign manufacturers like Kia and Hyundai. Additionally, the credits now apply at the point of sale, meaning you get an instant price cut on these cars without having to wait for tax season.
Those point-of-sale rebates have proved mighty popular. So far this year, EV buyers have received over $1 billion in incentives for some 150,000 car purchases, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

"Tesla, Two Other Brands' EV Sales Are Most Driven By Tax Credits",https://insideevs.com/news/742782/tesla-ev-tax-credit-jdpower-study/,"The modern EV tax credit system may be on the way out when President Trump returns, but it has some surprising winners and losers.",11/30/2024 16:25,"President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal the electric vehicle tax credits ushered in by the Inflation Reduction Act, but that move is surprisingly supported by his new buddy-advisor-campaign financier Elon Musk. But a new study from J.D. Power indicates that Tesla's sales really do stand to take a hit if those credits go away.
The auto industry marketing research firm's latest E-Vision Intelligence Report has some fascinating new data about which automakers benefitted most from the tax credits, which cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new EV purchase or lease if certain conditions are met. The biggest winners: Volkswagen, Chevrolet, and Tesla, in that order.
""Among all EV purchase drivers, tax credits and incentive programs are the most frequently selected reason for purchase among Volkswagen (81%), Chevrolet (77%) and Tesla (72%) buyers,"" the study said. The report was based on a survey of new car buyers but interestingly does not include Tesla Cybertruck, Polestar, and Rivian owners.
To qualify for EV tax credits, generally speaking, the EVs and their batteries must be made in North America, as the IRA is meant to incentivize local production.
According to the survey, the ""premium vehicle segment""—of which all Tesla models are included—benefitted the most from the tax credits. While that does play into the criticism that tax dollars are essentially helping wealthier people buy expensive cars, it also makes sense; EVs for now are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts and cheaper, more mainstream models are just now starting to debut after years of being confined to the higher end of things. In the ""premium"" arena, ""64% of EV owners say tax credits and other incentives influenced their purchase decision. In the mass market segment, 49% of EV owners were influenced by tax credits and incentives."" And it seems like the inclusion of Tesla as a ""premium"" brand helped skew the data in that direction as well.
After all, a Volkswagen ID.4 can be obtained at fairly mainstream prices now, and all of Chevrolet's EVs represent great values that aren't too far off their gas-powered counterparts depending on equipment and trim levels. Thus, it could be argued that the tax credits are succeeding in moving the EV sector into more normal levels of pricing; as EV sales increase and the battery supply chain grows, prices will continue to go down.
The numbers are fascinating: ""Among premium brand EV owners, 64% say that tax credits and other incentives were a primary driver of their decision to purchase or lease their EV,"" the study said. ""Among mass-market EV owners, 49% selected their vehicle based on tax credits and incentives. Industry-wide, 87% of all EVs purchased or leased in 2024 received the federal EV tax credit.""
Moreover, the tax credits are helping people to save money at a time when new car prices are through the roof and everyone's getting squeezed out on grocery prices. ""On average, consumers purchasing or leasing a new EV in 2024 saved $5,124 thanks to federal EV tax incentives,"" the study said. ""That’s up from $4,302 in 2023 and $1,629 in 2022. For EV leases in 2024, the average amount claimed in federal tax incentives was $6,696, and for sales, it was $4,257.""
So whose buyers were least motivated by the EV tax credits? According to J.D. Power, that would be Toyota, Hyundai and Kia—a truly interesting result. None of those Asian automakers build their EVs in America (though this is changing right now with the new Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and others) and so they do not qualify for the tax credits unless they're leased. Somewhere between a fifth and a third of those brands' buyers said they were motivated by the tax credits. In Hyundai and Kia's case, EVs also benefitted from aggressive manufacturer and dealer discounts. That all tracks with what we already know: most Hyundai and Kia EVs are leased, and it may speak to why the Korean automakers' executives say they aren't worried about sales dropping if they lose the credits.
The study also confirms one thing we've been hearing for the past few years: that the EV tax credit scheme is confounding to many buyers and they probably aren't getting much help navigating it from their dealers. ""All told, 43% of EV shoppers say they would describe their understanding of current EV incentives as 'vague,' 'minimal' or 'don’t know,'"" the study said. ""Just 17% say they have a 'strong' understanding of EV incentives.""
There are a few things we can glean from all of this data. First, it's yet another data point that counters Musk's claim that losing the tax credits ""probably actually helps Tesla"" in the long term, unless he's counting on a total collapse of the sector without the IRA. Second, losing the tax credits will probably hit reset on the calculus the entire auto industry has been working on for the past few years. And finally, it's further proof that the tax credits are helping to move metal and save people money at the same time.  “Having that extra incentive was enough to convince people to buy their EV,” Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice, told Automotive News. “It wasn’t just the price alone.”

This Hellcat Is A Tesla Model S Plaid Underneath: 'It Fits Perfect',https://insideevs.com/news/742777/tesla-hellcat-boosted-boiz/,"The BoostedBoiz are at it again with another Tesla body swap, and you don't want to rev on this at a stoplight.",11/30/2024 12:00,"We're now a few weeks away from the first Dodge Charger EVs hitting the streets, and even if the Mopar-or-no-car crowd is understandably skeptical about trading Hemi V8 power for electricity, we know that car won't be messing around at the drag strip. But as they tend to do, the tuners got there first.
The guys at the BoostedBoiz channel are at it again with another build and this is perhaps their most subversive one yet: a 2023 Dodge Challenger Hellcat gutted and swapped with a Tesla Model S Plaid drivetrain and battery. You've likely seen these guys and their wild creations in the electric space before: they're the nutjobs who turned a ratty old Honda Odyssey minivan into a drag-strip killer using another Plaid drivetrain. That 1,020-horsepower sleeper van proved able to handle itself against a modified Porsche 911 Turbo S at an oval track earlier this year, so it's fair to say these guys know what they're doing.
Yet host Kyle Wade said that he got this even brighter idea when he realized that the Model S has a nearly identical wheelbase to a Challenger. The remarkably similar size, he figured, would allow them to package the Model S' battery, motors and other internals more easily than other swaps. Plus, it'd be fun to screw with those owners: ""I couldn't think of a better group of people to not want one of their cars to be taken and turned into an EV,"" he said.
I say it's all in good fun; what's the modified drag racing scene without crazy ideas and one-upmanship?
Tesla Challenger BoostedBoiz
After finding a 2013 Challenger shell at a junkyard on Facebook Marketplace for $700 (honestly, not bad) the crew took it back to their shop and immediately started cutting the floor out. Despite the cars' similar size, swapping the Tesla onto the Dodge wasn't as straightforward as expected; they had to cut off and rework nearly the entire front section of the Challenger plus a significant part of the rear to accommodate the Tesla's suspension. And that was only the start of the extensive bodywork needed to make this happen, which they recap in the video above.
This whole project really took some doing, but in the end, it worked as expected. The front part of the interior is all Tesla, complete with a custom metal seat, and when the body was fully reassmbled by the end it's hard to distinguish the Challenger from any other out there—unless you take a look inside or under the hood.
Also, the radio and climate controls still work. Amazing.
The only thing that would give this ""Cybercat"" away is how it would blast off a stoplight while making no noise whatsoever. With all-wheel-drive and 1,020 horsepower, it's just gone with zero drama.
You know this crew is going to do more with this build at the track soon, and I'm excited to see what they do with it. And I'm even more excited to see the reactions to it. ""The SRT boys are gonna be real mad about this one,"" Kyle said.

"MKBHD Has A Crush On The Polestar 3, But He Wouldn’t Buy One",https://insideevs.com/news/742749/mkbhd-polestar-3-crush-review/,The content creator says there is a big difference between the Polestar 3’s highs and lows.,11/30/2024 10:00,"Polestar offers the Polestar 3 as a sportier alternative to the Volvo EX90, with which it shares its underpinnings, motors, batteries and tech. The result is a crossover that is easy to recommend even despite its quirks, and it made Marques Brownlee fall in love with it. He also said it’s not a car he would consider buying for himself.
The tech vlogger explains in the video review he uploaded on his car-centric channel Auto Focus that there is a significant difference between the car’s high and low points. It does several things really well, one of which is design. Its exterior is unique with its lower-slung take on the SUV formula and a tapering roofline that doesn’t quite put it in the coupe-SUV genre.
Polestar has even integrated a wing in the front—very unusual—which helps smooth the air flowing over the car and is complemented by an additional wing in the back. There are additional “aero blades” on the rear of the car, which serve the same purpose on the sides of the car.
Second-row headroom isn’t affected by the shape of the roof, and the interior is also a pleasant place to be. It strikes a great balance between the ultra-minimalist approach you see in a Tesla and the more conventional button-heavy cars, although it still leans too much toward minimalism, according to Marques.
He points to the confusing unlabeled buttons on the steering wheel or the single pair of window controls for the front and back glass. The Polestar 3 is also one of those cars whose glove box only opens through the screen—ugh.

There is little to criticize about the SPA2 platform that underpins the Polestar 2. It is the first production vehicle to have this platform, which bestows it with a 111-kilowatt-hour battery pack good for up to 350 miles of EPA range. The top dual-motor version makes 510 horsepower and accelerates to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, but its claimed range drops to 279 miles.
It can decouple its motors to maximize coasting efficiency, and the dual-motor variant gets torque vectoring, which Polestar says improves cornering speed and improves traction on slippery surfaces.
Another thing that makes the Polestar 3 attractive is its eligibility for the full $7,500 federal tax credit. It lowers the South Carolina-built SUV’s entry price to $67,500, helping it undercut rivals like the BMW iX or the Audi Q8 E-Tron.

Jaguar Will Buy Back Thousands Of I-Pace EVs That Could Catch Fire,https://insideevs.com/news/742670/jaguar-buying-back-ipace-fire/,"All these Jaguar EVs were subject to recalls meant to address the fire risk, but it apparently wasn’t fixed.",11/29/2024 10:00,"Jaguar can’t seem to catch a break these days. After its rebranding campaign attracted a lot of negativity, now it’s decided to buy back nearly 3,000 of its I-Pace EVs due to the risk of fire. Owners of these vehicles had previously been asked to charge their vehicles outside, and dealers installed an 80% charging limit to minimize the risk of a battery malfunction that could set the battery pack and the entire vehicle alight.
All of the 2,760 affected examples were built in 2018 and were all subject to recalls meant to address the fire risk. They received software fixes for this issue, but they apparently didn’t work, and three cars still caught fire even after they were updated. When Jaguar informed the owners of the affected vehicles that they should park and charge outside (in August), the manufacturer said it was working on a permanent solution.
The automaker investigated the issue further and probably discovered that repairing all the affected cars (like GM did with the Chevy Bolt EV) wasn’t economically viable or too complicated. This could explain why Jaguar resorted to buying all of the cars, and it remains to be seen what sort of compensation it has planned for the owners. The I-Pace is a heavily depreciating car, and the affected examples are over five years old by now, so it won’t be as big a financial burden as buying back cars that are still new.
In June of 2023, Jaguar recalled almost 6,400 I-Pace EVs manufactured between 2018 and 2023 to have their battery control module software updated and any battery modules with faulty cells (manufactured by LG Energy Solutions) replaced. The recall came after eight I-Pace fires in the U.S. alone.
More On The I-Pace
Jaguar has announced that I-Pace production will end in December of this year, when its total global sales are expected to reach around 70,000 units. The I-Pace is made by Magna Steyr in Austria, which also manufactures the smaller E-Pace crossover. Jaguar also stopped production of the XE, XF and F-Type in May to prepare for its repositioning as a more premium Porsche and Bentley rival.
It will launch three new electric models built on a bespoke EV platform. The first will be a fancy fastback previewed by a concept car set to be revealed on December 2 in Miami. Jaguar has teased the upcoming study, which, just like its rebranding as a whole.",Andrei Nedelea
"Fiat 500e Production Paused, Again",https://www.motor1.com/news/742532/fiat-500-electric-production-paused/,Two Maserati models will also be out of commission for a whole month.,12/25/2024 1:26,"Oh, here we go again. Stellantis has no other option but to pause production of the Fiat 500e. Demand for the electric city car continues to be poor, forcing another hiatus at the Mirafiori plant. The Italian factory suspended output several times this year and it's about to do it once more. After telling unions that operations would be suspended from December 18 until January 5, it’s now adding the December 2-17 interval to the stoppage.
Consequently, the Fiat 500e will not be assembled from Monday, December 2, until Sunday, January 5, 2025. It’s not just the diminutive hatchback impacted by the low demand as Maserati is facing an identical problem. Production of the GranTurismo and GrabCabrio will also be halted during this interval. Through the voice of Stellantis’ head honcho Carlos Tavares, the exotic brand recently blamed bad marketing for sluggish sales.
Fiat’s parent company says activities at its factory in Turin will be temporarily stopped due to a ""continuing uncertainty in sales of electric cars in several European markets.” EVs account for 97% of the production at the Mirafiori facility. Stellantis goes on to say it’s putting the brakes on Maserati production as well due to low demand for luxury cars outside Europe, such as the United States and China.
The wheels are in motion to resuscitate sales of the new Fiat 500 by selling a version with a combustion engine. The plan is to roll out a hybrid 500 in 2026 when production will commence at the same Italian site. Made in Poland, the previous-generation model is still sold in certain regions with gas power. Yes, we’re talking about a car that originally hit the market in 2007. Its Abarth hot hatch counterpart is still available, but Fiat’s performance division has already announced plans to go purely electric.

The Electric Range Rover Might Have Four Motors,https://insideevs.com/news/742673/range-rover-electric-hot-weather-testing/,“The most capable and refined” Range Rover will go on sale next year.,11/29/2024 6:06,"Well, it’s happening. The Range Rover, a vehicle that’s widely recognized as one of the poshest, most comfortable and off-road capable SUVs in the world, is getting an all-electric version. But you’d be forgiven for believing that the Range Rover Electric–that’s the official name–is powered by anything but dinosaur juice.
That’s because the battery-powered Range Rover looks exactly like its gas-powered counterpart. At least, that’s what I’m getting from the latest batch of official photos released by Land Rover. The electric Range Rover prototypes are currently undergoing hot weather testing in the United Arab Emirates, and the British marque seems to think there’s no point in keeping the luxury EV under wraps anymore–because it’s exactly like the ICE SUV we already know.
Take a look for yourself. All the official images are in the gallery below, and apart from a couple of add-on monitoring devices that are to be expected on development prototypes, the Range Rover Electric is the same elegant SUV that’s become a staple of understated luxury–and massive depreciation rates, but that’s another story.
More Electric SUVs
We still don’t know what’s under the skin of the big electric SUV, but Land Rover mentioned the Range Rover EV will get something called Intelligent Torque Management. According to the automaker, the system distributes the wheel slip management task to each individual electric drive control unit, reducing the torque reaction time at each wheel from around 100 milliseconds to as little as 1 millisecond.
That’s mighty impressive. It also sounds a lot like the Range Rover Electric will have four motors, possibly one for each wheel, something we’ve only seen on a handful of production vehicles so far, including the Rivian R1S Quad-Motor, Rimac Nevera and Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology. (Try saying that three times in a row.)
This is still unconfirmed, so take it with a grain of salt. The size of the battery and the power of the electric motors are still unknown. That said, I wouldn’t expect record-breaking driving range figures, seeing how the gas-powered Range Rover is already quite heavy, tipping the scales at around 5,000 pounds. Adding a big battery will only make the thing harder to move, which will surely take a toll on the range.
But in the luxury world, it seems that going very far on a full charge isn’t quite as important as the experience itself. Just look at the Rolls-Royce Spectre–it weighs a healthy 6,600 pounds and can go up to 277 miles on a full charge. That hasn’t stopped Rolls-Royce from posting record sales, though.",Iulian Dnistran
You Can Finally Buy Your Tesla When The Lease Ends–Except In These States,https://insideevs.com/news/742650/tesla-lease-buyout-2024/,All of Tesla’s passenger EVs are eligible for the new lease buyout option.,11/29/2024 3:23,"Tesla is once again offering its customers the option to purchase their electric cars when the lease term ends. The AI and robotics company previously allowed lease buyouts for the Model S and Model X but that option was retired in 2022.
Now, it’s back. Starting November 27, 2024, all of Tesla’s passenger EVs are eligible for the lease buyout. This means the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck can be bought outright from Tesla at the end of the lease instead of just returning them to the automaker. Third-party dealerships are also eligible to purchase leased EVs.
However, according to Tesla's updated Lease-End Options webpage, customers in Iowa and Louisiana are not eligible for lease buyouts.
More Tesla Stuff
If the car is leased through Tesla Lease Trust and you want to buy it and keep it at the end of the lease, the automaker will provide a purchase estimate through the Tesla smartphone app. Owners need to access the “Financing” tab, then go to “Lease Details,” “Manage Lease” and select “Purchase Vehicle.” After confirming the intent to buy the car, Tesla will prepare a purchase packet with a good through date that matches the estimate, as per the automaker’s website.
A vehicle inspection will be made if it’s needed, according to the local requirements. Also, all the the parties listed on the lease agreement need to sign the purchase packet and then the estimated purchase amount has to be paid in full. Finally, Tesla will review and prepare the necessary paperwork and the ownership transfer documents will be mailed to the owner.
This is good news for anyone who was hoping to keep their leased Tesla but we can’t but question the reason behind the decision. In the past, the automaker’s outspoken CEO, Elon Musk, said that Tesla’s intention for the returning leased vehicles is to transform them into self-driving vehicles eventually. Does the reintroduction of the lease buyout option mean that robotaxi dreamers are left waiting for the Cybercab? Or maybe it’s just another end-of-year push to get some more money?
We don’t know–Tesla doesn’t answer questions from the media. One thing is clear, though: if you want to buy your leased Tesla, now is the time.",Iulian Dnistran
"Rivian Will Power Volkswagen’s Electric Golf, ‘Project Trinity’",https://insideevs.com/news/742492/vw-project-trinity-rivian-sdv/,"The tech will first come to Audi and Porsche as early as 2027, but VW's flagship EV is on that list too.",11/28/2024 14:00,"Volkswagen's flagship EV, coined ""Project Trinity,"" has been hyped up as the German brand's saving grace in a time when VW has gone from just a cool guy brand to one that is struggling to convince people to buy their vehicles. But, VW has also been kicking Trinity's can down the road, delaying it in favor of other vehicles like the new Golf EV and members of the current ID-family lineup. Now we know why.
It turns out that Volkswagen is really taking to its new partnership with Rivian—after all, it's spending $5 billion on the joint venture for a reason. And Trinity? Well, its flagship EV should be using its new flagship architecture. And that's exactly what the automaker plans on doing, according to Automotive News.
It turns out that Project Trinity is alive, although delayed, and is still planned to have all those nifty features like Level 4 self-driving. Part of the reason for that delay isn't just to first move forward with a more ""iconic product,"" as VW justifyingly calls the electrified version of the Golf, but to also give the automaker some time to figure out how to best implement the new Software-Defined Vehicle architecture borrowed from its joint partnership with Rivian.
“We decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,” VW's CEO, Thomas Schafer, during a media roundtable. “It will happen with Rivian, the joint venture, where we put the new electric electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we’ll start with the Golf.”
The Golf will be shown in 2029, followed by Trinity at a later date. While this doesn't explicitly give a timeline to Trinity's launch, it does confirm earlier reports from the German newspaper Handelsblatt that Trinity would be pushed back in favor of the Golf EV and that its launch would not be in 2026 as originally intended. Current rumors point to a reveal in 2032 at the earliest.
That being said, don't expect to see a million VW Trinities (or whatever Volkswagen ends up calling it) on the road. The car is planned to be a bespoke product—think the venerable Phaeton, but electric instead of the niche W12 under the hood. I'm not sure that's the best move for Volkswagen right now, but maybe things will turn around in the next eight years.
“We just switched a little bit, moved it out a little bit, not because we don’t see it as a huge priority, but Trinity was never designed as a volume vehicle,” said Schafer.
The Golf won't be the first EV in Volkswagen's family of brands to get Rivian treatment. Schafer confirmed that Porsche and Audi will be the first brands to receive the new electrical architecture as early as 2027. This tracks with the idea of more expensive and experimental tech being stuffed in high-end brands before trickling down to the mass market. But fear not—the architecture will eventually underpin vehicles across the VW family of brands, from cheap compacts to luxury SUVs (and maybe even sport-focused cars as well).
As for Project Trinity, well, that still appears to be Volkswagen's Polaris more than anything else, just a bit delayed now. If impressive enough, maybe Trinity can spark some interest back in the VW brand for the mass market, even if the car isn't intended to be built in large numbers. The important thing is that Volkswagen is using the tech to build a thicker backbone, and Trinity could be one of the most important building blocks along the way.

Tesla Finally Grants Owners Control Of The Charging Port Heater,https://insideevs.com/news/742609/tesla-charging-port-heater-control/,"You once could enable the port warmer in combination with other heating elements, but now it can be done separately.",11/28/2024 13:26,"Teslas started getting charging port heaters in the second part of 2020, although not all vehicles produced that year have it. Now all models get this dedicated heater that specifically warms the charging port to prevent ice buildup, allowing owners to easily open it in winter, but how you enable it isn’t obvious.
This is because until now you haven’t been able to turn the charger on separately. You could enable it together with the rear defrost (which also heats the side mirrors) or along with heating the cabin, but not on its own. Now, according to Not A Tesla App, the manufacturer has rolled out an over-the-air update that finally allows owners to only enable the port heater without it being paired with something else.
This was added with software version 2024.44.3.1, and the feature was confirmed on the Model Y and Model X, but it’s surely going to come to the rest of the model lineup. With this update installed, you will find an option called Charge Port Heater if you go to Controls then Service.
More On EVs In Winter
Owners who live in colder climates will benefit most since they will be able to keep the charge port ice-free without expending additional energy to defrost the windows or heat up the cabin. It still comes on automatically with the general defrost functions, as well as when you precondition the battery for charging or select a Supercharger as the destination via the car’s navigation.
It’s not all that common to get a charging port door that’s frozen in place and won’t open, though. Even with heavy snowfall, unless the snow melts and is then frozen, you should still be able to plug in.
A bigger issue that Tesla owners have had in winter is frozen doors and windows. Since all Tesla vehicles have frameless doors, the side windows need to roll down automatically about an inch to open the door. If there’s ice buildup that doesn’t allow the window to go down, you won’t be able to open the door.
Frozen door handles are also a source of annoyance, especially for owners of the Model S and Model X, whose door handles are powered and are meant to extend when the vehicle is unlocked. However, when the car is locked they sit flush with the body, thick ice can form on top of them and the power of their servos won’t be enough to punch through.
Model Y and Model 3 door handles aren’t powered so owners need to push on the back of the handle to make the front part pop out to open any of the doors. However, these too can get blocked, so Tesla redesigned them to be pushed from both sides to help make breaking ice easier. We know frozen charging ports and door handles are among the most common EV winter issues. Let us know in the comments if it’s ever happened to you and how you dealt with it.",Andrei Nedelea
Volkswagen Is Planning A Major Design Overhaul With More Buttons,https://www.motor1.com/news/742405/vw-design-overhaul-more-buttons/,"It also wants to improve interior quality, leading with the next ID.3 and ID.4.",12/25/2024 1:26,"Facing plant closures and massive layoffs, it’s safe to say Volkswagen has lost its mojo. The years when the Golf used to dominate sales charts in Europe seem like distant memories. The so-so styling of its electric cars isn’t exactly driving people into showrooms, and the oversimplified interiors aren't helping either. All while prices increase, forcing customers to reconsider their options.
But a fix is on the way, or so VW pledges. In an interview with Auto Express, VW’s development boss Kai Grünitz promised significant changes are planned. The next ID.3 and ID.4 will usher in a ""completely new design language."" That’s great to hear since the bulbous EVs could really need a fresh look. He went on to say a revamped visual identity will mark a return to form by going “back to where we originally came from, from a design perspective, and return to what Volkswagen is known for.”
Stepping inside, the user interface will also be improved by bringing back more traditional controls. Expect future VWs to feature extra buttons to quickly access often-used functions instead of having to rely on submenus on the touchscreen. Aside from adding back conventional keys as previewed by the ID.2all concept, a boost in quality is on the way. That’s one of the major problems the Golf Mk8 is facing, especially when compared to its excellent predecessor.
But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard promises about nicer interiors. At the end of 2022, VW Group chairman Oliver Blume talked about a “quality offensive.” As you can imagine, these changes don’t happen overnight. We’ll have to wait for the next generation of cars to see whether the folks from Wolfsburg live up to their promises.
Talking specifically about the ID.3 and ID.4, Kai said VW will also bring “a lot of improvements in terms of battery costs and performance.” He went as far as to say the overhauled EVs “will be a huge improvement” for both the automaker (by driving down production costs) and its customers by getting better cars overall. The new electric vehicles are expected to arrive in 2026.
It’s too soon to say whether the ID.3 will keep its name. VW has already announced the ninth-generation Golf is going to be electric, with the Mk8 to continue with combustion engines until as late as 2035. At the beginning of the year, Kai strongly hinted the return of the electric Golf could kill the ID.3: “There is not enough space to have two or three different models fitting to the same customer. We've started to work on a fully electric Golf.”

"Honda’s CUV e: EV Scooter Lands In Europe, Could Change The E-Mobility Game",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742089/honda-cuv-e-electric-scooter-launch-europe/,Honda’s practical EV scooter leverages the Mobile Power Pack e:,12/25/2024 1:26,"A lot of the new electric two-wheeler innovations we’ve been seeing in recent years have come mostly from new players which were mostly previously unheard of. And unfortunately, a lot of these companies have been forced to shut down due to a myriad of financial issues.
But one thing a lot of these companies had in common was that they were perhaps simply dreaming too big. Companies like Sondors and Fuell revealed highly sophisticated and futuristic two-wheelers which were just trying to be too many things all at once. Plus, the fact that these brands pretty much had zero track record in the motorcycle industry didn’t really help, either.
But now we’re seeing mainstream players join the electric scene in full force. We’ve seen it with Kawasaki’s Z and Ninja E-1, and now, with Honda, and its CUV e:, a simple, no-frills electric scooter.
Honda’s been making headlines recently when it comes to its electric initiatives. At EICMA, Big Red unveiled two EV motorcycle concepts, and not long after, announced that it was investing heavily in solid-state battery technology. All while Honda’s Mobile Power Pack e: has been proving its versatility in Europe and Japan, powering everything from construction equipment to light EVs to electric tourist boats.
And now, Honda has brought the CUV e: to Europe, and I think it’s an electric scooter that could change the game.
Why? Well, because it’s simple. You see, the CUV e: isn’t really trying to be anything other than a practical, utilitarian scooter that wants to get you from point A to B. It’s everything everyone has come to know and love about scooters, and it just so happens to be electric.
It gets a flat floorboard for you to put some stuff on, a comfortable seating position, a cubby hole up front, and the option to install a selection of practical accessories like a top case, luggage rack, and windscreen. Sure, it boasts connectivity tech like Honda’s RoadSync and built-in navigation. But it doesn’t go overboard with tons of tech simply for the sake of tech. Best of all, it’s powered by a tried and tested powertrain that puts the Honda Mobile Power Pack e: in the spotlight once again.
The CUV e: makes use of the portable Honda Mobile Power Pack e:.
With all the crazy things going on in the electric motorcycle industry, the Honda CUV e: certainly looks like a breath of fresh air. The fact that it’s made by one of the biggest and most trusted manufacturers in the world is a big plus, too. Now, I don’t know about you, but if I were asked whether I’d choose a Honda EV scooter or some Chinese knockoff EV scooter, you can bet I’d pick the Honda. Even if it cost twice that of the Chinese scooter.
To that end, how Honda prices this thing will indeed be a very important factor when considering its potential success. Nevertheless, Honda has proven that it knows how to make value-packed two-wheelers, and chances are the CUV e:’s price will reflect this, too.

2025 Chevy Equinox EV Crushes Tesla Model Y In Range Test,https://insideevs.com/news/742513/2025-chevy-equinox-ev-beats-model-y-range-test/,"We knew the $35,000 Chevy Equinox EV was a range champion. Now, it has beaten its own EPA rating.",11/27/2024 16:00,"A year ago, General Motors' electric vehicles built on the Ultium platform were stumbling. Software glitches left an InsideEVs reporter stranded in rural Virginia. Production challenges piled up and customers faced maintenance issues. Fast forward 12 months and GM has staged a major turnaround. Its EVs are thriving and the Chevy Equinox EV is especially crushing it.
In an independent range test conducted by car trading and research firm Edmunds, the 2025 Chevy Equinox EV blew past its EPA range estimate of 319 miles. The base Equinox EV LT traveled 356 miles in the range test, a 12% improvement over its EPA rating. That's a pretty significant achievement, given that the Equinox EV LT is the cheapest EV with over 300 miles of range. Now we know that it can go far beyond that.
Edmunds also maintains a leaderboard for the longest-range EVs on sale in the U.S. The Equinox EV handily beat several other popular long-range EVs on that list, notably the 2023 Tesla Model Y, a direct competitor to the Chevy. The Model Y Long Range went 310 miles under similar conditions and the exact same test parameters. That's 46 miles of difference for a car that costs roughly $10,000 less by today's prices.
Speaking of prices, the Equinox EV is also the most affordable GM EV on the Ultium platform. It has a starting price of $35,000, including destination, which can come down to about $27,500 with the full $7,500 federal tax credit factored in. It's powered by an 85-kilowatt-hour battery back, sourced from Ultium Cells, a joint venture between GM and Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution.
The Equinox EV's observed energy consumption was also about 6% less than the EPA estimate. It consumed about 29 kilowatt hours per 100 miles, compared to 31 kWh per 100 miles as per the EPA, which translates to about 3.45 miles per kWh. That means it also fared better than the 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (338 miles), Honda Prologue (320 miles) and the Cadillac Lyriq (319 miles) respectively—the Prologue and Lyriq ride on the same Ultium platform.
The weather seems to have favored the range test, but the parameters are the exact same for all EVs. It was 61 degrees Fahrenheit and the test was conducted on a mix of city (60%) and highway (40%) driving. In InsideEVs 70 mph highway range test of the 2024 Equinox EV 2RS, the crossover managed to cover 306 miles, outperforming its EPA estimate of 291 miles.
The Chevy tackles two of the biggest concerns facing electric cars: range and affordability. That could be why it's the best-selling GM EV and among the best-selling non-Tesla EVs. In the third quarter, GM managed to sell nearly 10,000 units of this car. But now, some of that momentum could be stalled as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to slap a blanket 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, where the Equinox and Blazer EVs are manufactured.

The Best And Worst Times To Charge Your EV This Thanksgiving,https://insideevs.com/news/742511/ev-charging-trip-thanksgiving-tips/,And other tips for road tripping in your EV during one of the busiest holiday weekends.,11/27/2024 14:00,"For many EV owners, Thanksgiving will be one of only a handful of times a year that they need to visit a fast-charging station. That’s the beauty of EVs: For everyday use, owners can plug in at home and wake up to a full charge daily.
The flip side is that during the busiest holiday weekends, when everybody is out road tripping to see their families, EV drivers swarm a limited number of charging stations. That can result in long lines and a bad day. Nobody wants that.
A GM Energy charging station.
Paren, a firm specializing in EV charging data, projects 1.8 million public EV charging sessions during Thanksgiving week and says that drivers will spend a collective 8.5 million hours plugged in at the fast charging stations most likely to be used while traveling (those with four or more plugs).

Historically, public EV charging infrastructure has been problematic, to say the least. Plugs are broken or unavailable more often than owners would like. And there are still parts of the country where they’re hard to come by. Paren says that’s all improving.
According to the firm, 1,100 new public charging stations with four ports or more have come online since last Thanksgiving. Plus, charging networks like Electrify America are upgrading their old sites and paying more attention to reliability. Across the thousands of travel-oriented stations it analyzed, reliability is up slightly to 85.5%. Broadly speaking, that means 85 out of 100 visits will be successful, Paren CTO and cofounder Bill Ferro told InsideEVs. That’s better than before, but still “sketchy,” Ferro said.
At Tesla Superchargers, which aren’t factored into that data, reliability is likely higher, he said. But when you consider all fast-charging locations—not just the travel-focused stations—it’s a lot lower.
Paren says that despite the hundreds of thousands of new EVs that have hit the road in the last year, America’s charging infrastructure is ready for Thanksgiving travel. You can make sure you spent less time charging—and more time with loved ones—by following some best practices recommended by the firm’s experts.
According to Paren’s data, you’ll have the least competition at the charging station overnight, from midnight to 6 a.m. Afternoons will tend to be the worst, with one exception: If you can sneak out on Thursday afternoon, that may be one of the best times to juice up ahead of the ride home.
As opposed to last year, many non-Tesla EV drivers now have access to the company's formerly exclusive Supercharger network, giving them about 18,000 more plugs to choose from. You’ll need to have a vehicle that works with Superchargers (see the list of manufacturers here). And you’ll most likely need to have a manufacturer-approved adapter, something Ferro recommends keeping at the ready this week.
“That, to me, is just a huge game changer,” he said. “If I had a non-Tesla vehicle and I was going on a road trip anytime, including this week, I would have an adapter with me, and I would look to take advantage of that.”

Paren analyzed Tesla’s charger deployments this year and found that 91%—4,300 stalls—work with non-Tesla EVs. That includes some of its “Magic Dock” chargers, which any EV can use without an adapter.
Ferro recommends avoiding most fast chargers located at car dealerships, as they have some of the worst reliability scores. They’re often old, underutilized and can be blocked by other cars.
Charging stations along major corridors are most likely to work the best, said Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst, since they’re used regularly and earn money for their operators. However, they also may be the most slammed during busy travel times. The charging stations out in the middle of nowhere—ones that aren’t visited frequently—are more of a gamble, he said.

“The potential danger zone is if you’re out in Idaho or something like that, where it’s a small station operated by a regional player that gets one session, two sessions a day,” he said. “Nobody probably even knows if they’re working or not.”
Here are some other selected tips Paren shared that we’re passing on to you.
Charge to 100% before leaving for your trip. It may sound obvious, but if you have your car programmed to stop charging at 80%, as many do, here’s your reminder to adjust the limit ahead of time.
Precondition your car’s cabin while it’s plugged in. That way, you can warm up your car without sacrificing as much range. It takes a lot of energy to warm up a car from 40 degrees to a comfy 72. It requires less to maintain that temperature.
And treat your fellow EV drivers with respect. Only spend as much time plugged in as you absolutely need and keep it moving. That’ll give everyone something to be thankful for.

What Tesla Autopilot And Full-Self Driving Can And Can't Do,https://insideevs.com/news/742295/tesla-autopilot-abilities-fsd/,"Despite what Tesla often claims, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving still are not at an autonomous driving level. The cars cannot drive themselves.",11/27/2024 13:47,"Tesla’s success has been a major impetus behind the push toward electric vehicles. But the brand has been angling itself toward another, even more transformational shift: autonomous driving. Elon Musk has been predicting Level 5 autonomy was just around the corner since at least 2016 — and that Tesla vehicles were ready with the necessary hardware.
Tesla has charged more than $5,000 for features called “Enhanced Autopilot” and “Full-Self Driving.” And Tesla went as far as unveiling a driverless “Cybercab” robotaxi — coming before 2027 — earlier this year.
Tesla’s techno-optimism and terminology around autonomous driving have engendered confusion; the natural reaction to terms like Autopilot and Full-Self Driving is to take them literally. Prospective Tesla buyers and even knowledgeable owners can be misinformed — potentially dangerously — about what the vehicle they are driving is capable of.
To clarify matters, here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what Tesla’s driver assistance systems can and can’t do.
More Autopilot Info
Level 2 Self-Driving: Tesla’s Autopilot with Full Self-Driving is a Level 2 system. That means the vehicle can control steering within a marked lane (Autosteer) and adapt the vehicle’s speed (Traffic-aware cruise control) simultaneously. Consumer Reports describes Tesla’s Autopilot system as “middle of the pack” compared to other manufacturers.
Automated Lane Changes: A Tesla can assess the traffic situation and change lanes. Drivers can confirm the lane change with a tap of the turn signal in the appropriate direction. Drivers can disengage the confirmations. Navigate on Autopilot can maneuver Tesla into the proper lane through interchanges to follow a navigation route.
Summoning: Some Teslas offer a Summon feature. This feature allows owners to move the vehicle backward and forward — think into and out of a garage — remotely with the key fob. Tesla also introduced an “Actual Smart Summon” feature that lets an owner call the vehicle to them or another specified GPS point. The owner must be within 200 feet to Summon and can’t do so on public roads or in public lots.
Automatic Parking: Tesla’s Autopark system can detect perpendicular and parallel parking spaces at low speeds and control the braking, shifting and steering to maneuver the vehicle into those spaces.
Active Safety Features: Tesla offers many active safety features typically provided by other manufacturers including Automatic Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Obstacle Aware Acceleration, Blindspot Monitoring and Lane Departure warnings.
More On FSD
Drive Autonomously: No manufacturer has achieved Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy for road use. Tesla has not achieved Level 3 conditional autonomy like Mercedes-Benz’s DrivePilot system. A Tesla cannot drive itself. The driver must remain attentive at all times. Tesla now qualifies Autopilot and Full Self-Driving with a (Supervised) parenthetical on its website.
Hands-Free Driving: GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise allow the driver to go hands-free. However, Tesla’s Level 2 system is a hands-on system that requires the driver to regain control immediately. Torque sensors confirm the driver’s hands are on the wheel or yoke.
Level 2 Driving on City Streets: Tesla does list Autosteer on City Streets as a feature of Full-Self Driving. But notably, its website provides no further explanation of what that means. Tesla’s Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control — still officially in Beta — requires the driver to initiate or confirm essential functions like proceeding through an intersection and turning.
Remote Parking: The Smart Summon feature can bring a Tesla to a specific location. However, a summoned Tesla cannot automatically find a parking space and maneuver into it without a driver behind the wheel.
The short answer: nobody knows yet. Musk threw out a timeline of before the end of 2026 for the first Cybercab. However, Tesla is renowned for failing to meet initial target timelines. And that sounds like previous vague announcements Musk has been making for nearly a decade.
Tesla is more bullish on the timeline for autonomous driving than other manufacturers. Very broadly, Tesla believes it can get there with extant cameras on the vehicle and AI learning. Other significant players are approaching the issue with sophisticated and expensive LiDAR scanners, which could present a cost issue and limit the technology’s utility.
The other issue affecting the timeline is regulation. Musk’s influence with the Trump administration could help hasten that timeline. For instance, having a national standard for autonomous driving would be easier than obtaining approval state-by-state. Musk presumably could advise on the goalposts Tesla would have to meet to achieve that national standard.",Ty Duffy
Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",12/25/2024 1:26,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

Nissan's Situation Gets Dire: '12 Or 14 Months To Survive',https://insideevs.com/news/742456/nissan-hyundai-toyota-cm/,"Plus, Hyundai says it can win the EV war on ""quality,"" and Mexico is in a dilemma with its planned BYD factory.",11/27/2024 9:31,"As 2024 starts drawing to a close, it's more clear than ever that the business-as-usual era of the traditional auto industry is over.
You won't find just one reason for this. It's high interest rates and new car prices people can't afford, it's intensifying competition in once-lucrative China, it's consumer interest shifting to electrified cars and the high capital costs involved with making them... the list goes on. As we've seen with other industries in transitions, not every major player survives intact, and it may be time to start wondering who goes down first in the autos sector. Is Nissan due for such a reckoning?
That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and tech news. Also on tap today: how Korea's Hyundai Motor Group plans to do battle against China's electric vehicle sector, and Mexico gets cold feet over a possible BYD factory as President Trump seeks to intensify a trade war before he's even back in office.
As a programming note, your hardworking InsideEVs staff will be on more limited duty over the next few days over Thanksgiving weekend. We'll resume normal service next week, and we wish you and yours a wonderful holiday in the meantime.
2023 Nissan Ariya E-4ORCE
I tend to think three big, traditional automakers took especially hard hits this year. The first two are Volkswagen and Stellantis, the poster children for the declining European auto sector and what happens when China sales stop paying the bills like they used to. The other is Nissan. Once, it was Japan's no. 2 automaker behind Toyota and an early pioneer in the EV space in its own right.
But Nissan has been in steady and unfortunate decline for years, having struggled with the ouster of the top boss who once held its shaky 25-year-old alliance with Renault together, a subsequent exodus of talent, a protracted renegotiation of that alliance and just taking its eye off the ball in terms of products when it was distracted by all of that chaos. Frankly, it's hard to fathom what's gone right for Nissan over the last few years. Profits were down a staggering 85% in Japan's Q2 of this year.
Now, Renault is in the process of offloading a substantial share of its stake in Nissan. And Nissan desperately needs a capital partner or its very survival is at stake, anonymous officials told the Financial Times:
Two people with knowledge of the talks said Nissan was seeking a long-term, steady shareholder such as a bank or insurance group to replace some of Renault’s equity holding, as Nissan finalises the terms of its new electric vehicle partnership with arch-rival Honda. “We have 12 or 14 months to survive,” said a senior official close to Nissan.
Nissan has not ruled out having Honda buy some of its shares, with “all options” being considered, as it launches a series of restructuring measures on the back of declining sales in both China and the US, the people said.
[...] After their capital recalibration last year, the French carmaker cut its Nissan holding to just under 36 per cent, including a remaining 18.7 per cent in a French trust, which it has been whittling down. Nissan gained voting rights for its 15 per cent stake in Renault, which will retain a 15 per cent voting stake in the Japanese group.
Ouch. As that story notes, Nissan sells no hybrid cars in the U.S. at present, though it once did. Yet hybrid cars are doing wonders for Toyota, Hyundai, Kia and even Ford at the moment; while the Ariya is a solid EV, Nissan's old-school internal combustion powertrains just aren't competitive in the 2020s.
You may recall that Nissan and Honda are forging a partnership to collaborate on future EV powertrains and software. They're doing so because Japan Inc. is pretty far behind China at making the EVs of the future, and they need to team up to win together; another burgeoning alliance to do the same is Toyota's team-ups with several smaller partners like Mazda.
The Nissan-Honda tie-up is a technical partnership, not a capital one. The story floats the idea that Honda (which has taken hits in China too but is doing much better overall) could step in as Nissan's new financial partner. But it's unclear if either side is into that, or if it would even be effective. And would Honda gain much there?
Since announcing their partnership in August, both Japanese companies had played down the possibility of a capital tie-up, with one person close to Nissan saying Honda buying a stake remained “a last resort”.
The people familiar with the matter said the outcome of the talks would present a test case for how companies could survive the industry upheaval, pitting the likes of Stellantis, which was born out of a megamerger, against smaller players such as Renault and Nissan that forge technology and regional partnerships. “Is bigger really better? Or is the partnership model better?” said the senior official close to Nissan, noting that pursuing scale would lead to inefficiency after a certain point.
None of this bodes well for Nissan. We're talking about long-term, capital-intensive businesses, so it's impossible to fathom a 12- to 14-month window where it can get a ton of great hybrids and EVs on the road and win back market share in the U.S. and China. My theory is we could see some kind of restructuring, asset sale or acquisitions in its future rather than an outright end to operations, but how Nissan navigates this next year is anyone's guess.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Meanwhile, Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is getting a lot right at the moment. Its EVs are selling remarkably well, especially in the U.S., and its extensive portfolio of hybrids are providing valuable cover fire. Yet from all I've heard and seen, including from my own team at InsideEVs, Hyundai's EVs still trail ones from China in terms of technology.
So how does Korea fend off that much larger competitor? Quality, its incoming global CEO José Muñoz told the Korea JoongAng Daily:
Muñoz also said “China is a big threat” to the global auto industry, but Hyundai can put up a challenge in the cutthroat industry with enhanced “technological prowess” and “quality.” “A lot of consumers, when they buy Chinese products, they realize maybe the quality is not as good as others. They are not happy with the quality, maybe [there is] a mechanical issue or [a problem] with the maintenance,” he said. “It is the moment to elevate our game in terms of providing not only the best quality but also the best services to our customers. We have been able to attract the best dealers in different countries investing with us and then investing in facilities with equipment and training to provide better service.""
The quality and reliability of the Chinese automakers is tough to gauge. By most accounts, they have gotten vastly better at those things in recent years. But without reliable long-term data in the U.S. (or even in Europe) it's hard to say. The Koreans do understand the scope of the threat they face, however; it's not like they haven't been dealing with that beef for literal centuries now.
BYD Mexico
Speaking of China's automakers, they've made huge inroads into Latin America, including just south of the Texas border. Chinese EV giant BYD has long sought a local factory in Mexico. It entered ""wait and see"" mode with that plant due to the U.S. election, as both the automaker and the Mexican government feared the escalation of a trade war with America.
Basically, BYD has insisted that any car factory in Mexico would be to serve the Latin American market. But it's a no-brainer that such a factory could one day be poised to export cars to the U.S. if trade conditions changed.
Enter: President Donald Trump, who isn't in office yet and is already firing shots at China and Mexico. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, BYD sounds like it wants to make this happen but Mexico is being especially cautious here:
The plans put Mexico in a dilemma, made worse by Trump’s threat Monday to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican goods. The country is already a major car manufacturing center and generally welcomes foreign investment for the jobs it brings. BYD, which rivals Tesla as the biggest electric vehicle maker in the world, would normally be a prize catch.
But Mexican officials fear a BYD plant would send the wrong message to Trump and the trade hawks around him by suggesting that Mexico wants to be a backdoor for Chinese companies to sell to Americans. The president-elect is also taking aim at Mexico over immigration and smuggling of fentanyl, the issues he cited in the tariff threat.
Mexico says it isn’t aiming to be a conduit for Chinese-made goods and has made strides in addressing illegal immigration. It needs to persuade the U.S. and Canada of that when talks begin next year on extending the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade reached during the first Trump administration.
[...] The federal government isn’t happy with BYD’s timing and doesn’t want to provoke Trump, said one Mexican official. Federal consent would be essential for any BYD project in Mexico because the company would need environmental and import permits as well as other government support.
I still believe BYD's entry into the U.S. market is a question of when, not if. But all parties involved have a new landscape to navigate.

This E-Bike Helped Me Rediscover My Home,https://www.rideapart.com/reviews/742033/aventon-aventure2-long-term-review/,Two pedals and an electric motor propelled me to explore new places that were there the entire time.,12/25/2024 1:26,"I’ve always enjoyed going for long walks. When I briefly held a desk job, I’d go for a stroll every day during my lunch break. On my motorcycle travels across the United States and around the world, some of my fondest memories are of exploring destinations on foot, even when exhausted after spending hundreds of miles in the saddle. When not traveling, I’ll explore local parks and forest preserves. A ten-minute drive to the library or post office? It’s a beautiful day, let’s turn that into an hour plus walk!
But modern life being what it is, time constraints left me somewhat limited to the nearest local trails and suburban sidewalks, and I wanted to explore further. We have plenty of preserves and trails in the Chicago area, but the idea of “driving somewhere to go for a walk,” emitting exhaust fumes and mentally absorbing the stress of traffic on either side of my trek through nature always felt hypocritical and somewhat counterproductive.
I could’ve taken a pedal bike, but I was never comfortable being associated with the established bicycle tribes. Between the Lycra-clad wannabe road racers, Critical Mass activists, and extreme mountain bike bros, there seems to be some real gatekeeping issues in the bicycling community, and I wanted no part of it. Additionally, while I’m in pretty good shape, I am by no means an athlete and some of the inclines on our local trails can be a bit daunting. I was looking for a mobility solution that existed adjacent to the realm of cycling. Something that could take advantage of cycling infrastructure, offering the benefits of biking without all the baggage.
Enter the Aventon Aventure.2.
The handsome styling is welcoming and unaggressive. Its rugged good looks are both tempered and accentuated by the pleasing curves of the frame and fenders, the satin green paint, and utilitarian luggage rack. Despite the almost cartoonishly fat tires, the proportions somehow work, and the Aventure.2 successfully exists comfortably in its own skin without pretense and carries none of the cycle-bro baggage. I ride in cargo pants and hiking boots so that at any moment, I can pull over, park the bike trail-side out of the way, and wander into the woods snapping wildlife and nature photos.
The hardcore bikers would say e-bikes aren’t real bikes, and I’m not a real cyclist, and to that I say “perfect.” In a world of five-figure pedal bikes, could this $2,000 e-bike be the egalitarian solution to two-wheeled (sub)urban mobility?
Sporting a 750w motor, 15Ah battery, and torque-sensing electric assist system with 4 levels: Eco, Tour, Sport, and Turbo, there is a genuine accessibility to “casual cycling” on offer here, presenting a solid and viable alternative to automotive transportation for those previously uninterested or unable to pilot a motorcycle or scooter, or to pedal a traditional bicycle.
About accessibility, the Aventure.2 is offered in two frame sizes: regular and large. We chose to experiment with our frame size selection. Despite my 6’2” height and 34-inch inseam placing me near the top end of the “Large” frame on Aventon’s size chart, we opted for the “Regular,” which my partner is near the bottom of on their size chart with her 5’3” height and 27-inch inseam.
There is actually enough adjustability with the seat post that both of us are happy astride the “Regular” sized frame. The saddle offers a good compromise that’s both supportive and comfortable enough for my skinny, thinly padded ass while never interfering with a smooth pedal stroke.
The bars are damn near perfect. Not too high and wide, nor overly low and aggressive, and offering plenty of leverage and front-end feel. The reach is just right, giving me a bit of forward lean with a slight bend in the elbows, mimicking my preference for Naked and Sport-Touring motorcycle ergos. The left thumb-operated throttle is intuitive and makes way more sense to me than a twist grip on an E-Bike. Just gotta remember – we’re on a bicycle, so the front brake is on the left!
Regarding range, I was never able to achieve Aventon’s claimed “up to 60 miles.” Fully-charged batteries reliably returned 37 miles before hitting 0%. This has been consistent over nearly 1,000 miles and a wide range of temperatures, using either ECO or Touring mode. Surfaces were mixed, split evenly between hard (concrete and asphalt) and soft (gravel and grass), and mostly level with some inclines ranging from gradual to steep.
Even in an attempt to extract maximum range—sticking exclusively to ECO mode and turning E-assist off on level ground, with the fat tires aired up to decrease rolling resistance, and always contributing pedal power—I would consistently deplete the battery at 37 miles. Turns out that Aventon’s claimed range is determined over flat terrain using a rider weight of 160 pounds. I’m a few pounds heavier than that, usually packing water, snacks, and camera equipment, and ascending some hilly terrain, so there you go.
Also, the battery gauge is not linear, giving a false sense of range when first setting off on a full charge. Below 20%, power delivery seems to be limited. At 10% and below, you’re practically in “limp-home mode.” With a nearly depleted battery, even the slightest incline becomes a real chore for the electric motor. Moderate or steep grades become simply impossible for the E-assist system, and you’ll be lugging all 77 pounds of the Aventure.2 up that hill exclusively on pedal power.
Once you understand these limitations, it just takes a bit of route planning to avoid leaving yourself on a super steep incline at the end of your ride. Fortunately, the 48-tooth crank and 8-speed rear derailleur with cogs ranging from 12-32 teeth offer plenty of ratios to make unassisted pedaling manageable in most conditions.
And that’s the great thing about e-bicycles. Unlike offerings from Cake or Ubco, which leave you helpless once the battery runs flat, an e-bike like the Aventure.2 gives you options. You can dial in as much electric assistance as you want, or none at all.
You want a strenuous workout? No problem. You want to take it easy? You got it. Just pin the throttle wide open and give your legs a rest. Oops, you miscalculated your route and ran the battery flat? Just pedal home using the traditional 8-speed rear derailleur to select the appropriate gear ratios along the way.
Assist settings can be adjusted on the fly using the d-pad-like control cluster on the left handlebar. Power mode, speed, mileage and other trip data are easily read on the backlit LCD full color display, which is bright enough for the sunniest days, and suffers no problems with glare.
Not interested in trail riding, and you want to use the Aventure.2 for a quick run to the shop? I’ve done that, too. The included standard rear rack appears to be compatible with the Ortlieb QL2.1 mounting hook system, giving you a wide selection of panniers to choose from. The E-assist helps me feel much less vulnerable sharing the road with cars versus riding a traditional pedal bike. The reduced speed differential and agility to quickly accelerate out of a dangerous situation is reassuring and confidence-inspiring.
Regarding speed, the Aventure.2 ships from the factory as a Class 2 e-bike, which limits electric assist to 20 mph. Aventon’s app (iOS or Android) allows you to quickly pair your device via a QR code on the bike’s LCD display. This app gives you the ability to enable Class 3 operation of the Aventure.2, so electric assist can be dialed up to a maximum of 28 mph.
A pop-up in the app warns users that doing so may violate local laws, so be sure to check the regulations pertaining to e-bikes within the jurisdiction you’ll be operating one.
Regardless of the assist level, there is no “speed limiter.” The calipers won’t automatically clamp down on the disc brakes. You can go as fast as you’re capable of on pedal power; you just won’t get any more thrust from the motor beyond the maximum setting. So far, I’ve gotten the Aventure.2 over 29 mph on a moderate downhill.

Aventon Aventure.2 - rear lights with left indicator
Aventon Aventure.2 - LCD Panel
The Aventure.2’s battery also powers an LED lighting package comprised of rear running lights, brake lights, and indicators integrated into the frame just above the rear axle. There is a front headlight, but no front indicators. The headlight and turn signals are operated through the same d-pad control used to adjust e-assist levels and cycle through the trip computer.
The placement of the rear lights looks attractive and seems clever at first glance, but perhaps too clever for their own good. Their low placement can make them difficult for drivers to see and can be further obscured with panniers fitted to the rear rack.
E-bikes really seem to be where two-wheeled electrification makes sense. The overall practicality of this package makes for a legitimate contender as a car/motorcycle alternative for commuting, leisure, and light shopping runs.
The removable and quickly field-swappable battery pack opens a world of options for long-distance rides, as well as simplifying life for those who don’t have easy access to power where the bike is parked. Just pop the battery out, bring it in, and charge it at any regular household outlet. Makes a good theft deterrent too. Who would want to steal an e-bike without its proprietary $500 battery?

The Aventure.2 has given me the ability to go further and explore more of our local trails than I ever could have on foot. Like when I first got my motorcycle, I’ve found myself excited to ride, looking for reasons to take the e-bike out, scouring maps for new trails and different ways to get there.
Riding has given me a new appreciation for the little patch of the Earth I call home. The trails through our local forest and prairie preserves often feel magical, whether a disused old rail line tunneling through a lush green canopy of trees, or a gravel trail snaking its way through a sun-drenched expanse of tall prairie grass and native wildflowers.
Through riding, I’ve discovered an oasis of calm seclusion hidden right in the midst of our frenzied, chronically connected modern world. I’ve encountered wildlife I never would have otherwise met, watched vibrant hilltop sunrises overlooking mirror-like reservoirs, and snapped pictures that have reignited my interest in photography. I’ve started looking at my surroundings differently, and with a youthful fascination and excitement that this jaded Gen-Xer hasn’t felt in a long time.
The Aventure.2 is a fascinating dichotomy within itself, striking a charming balance between polar attributes. It accelerates your ability to explore your surroundings while slowing things down enough for you to appreciate them. It’s both cute and capable, welcoming yet rugged, confidently stylish while unpretentiously understated. I find myself grinning while riding it, and queried by smiling strangers curious to learn about it.
The Aventure.2 is the Suzuki Jimny of e-bikes, and I’m grateful at least one of them is available for purchase in my market.

Meanwhile, in the first nine months of this year, there were more battery-powered vehicles sold in California than in the whole of 2022, marking a clear upward trend for people’s appetite for zero- and low-emissions vehicles. Year-to-date, California recorded 343,213 EV and PHEV sales.
In the third quarter alone, California saw 115,897 EVs and PHEVs sold, while the entire country had 382,498 units get in customers' hands, according to data from public-private nonprofit Veloz. This means California alone amounts to 30.3% of the country’s electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, the electrified vehicle market share within California reached 26.4% in Q3.

As for the best-selling battery-powered cars in California in Q3, the Tesla Model Y took the crown, followed by the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 5. Interestingly, the Toyota Rav4 Prime plug-in hybrid surpassed the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model X, while the Volkswagen ID.4 placed seventh. The top 10 list was completed by the BMW i4, Tesla Cybertruck and Jeep Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid.
To support the growing number of plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles roaming its roads, California has installed over 150,000 public and shared private EV chargers. As of August 2024, the state has 137,648 Level 2 chargers and 14,708 Level 3 DC fast chargers. Furthermore, over 500,000 private home chargers have been installed at homes across the state.",Iulian Dnistran
Kia Eyes PHEVs With 60 Miles Of Electric Range: Here In 'A Couple Of Years',https://insideevs.com/news/742393/kia-phev-60-miles-electric-range/,Kia’s current PHEVs can travel roughly 30 miles on electric power before switching on the gas engine.,11/27/2024 3:25,"Besides kicking things into high gear in the all-electric vehicle game, Kia also wants to increase its footprint in the plug-in hybrid vehicle market. Not only by offering more battery-assisted cars which are more fuel efficient if plugged in regularly, but also by upping the maximum range of these models while running on battery power.
Currently, Kia’s PHEVs can cover up to 34 miles on electricity with a full battery before kicking in the gas engine. This could be enough for drivers who only do short journeys and can recharge at home, but how would 60 miles of all-electric range sound?
That’s almost double the number available today. It would significantly open up the market to people who wouldn’t consider a battery-powered car otherwise. They could drive the car on electricity most of the time for the usual errands around town and then fill up the gas tank if a long trip is coming up.
More PHEV Stuff
With battery tech advancing at a rapid pace and new vehicle platforms designed to fit bigger battery packs for gas-powered cars, these 60-mile PHEVs might come in as little as “a couple of years,” according to Steven Center, Kia America’s chief operating officer and executive vice president, who spoke with Green Car Reports during the Los Angeles Auto Show.
The 60-mile figure came from an “engineering statistic,” Center said, and it relates to the total daily driving distance for Americans. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, people in the United States travel a nationwide average of 42 daily miles. This includes all forms of transportation, including personal vehicles, mass transit, biking and walking.
At the same time, a study from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland showed that 52% of all trips made by Americans in 2021 were shorter than three miles and just 2% of trips were longer than 50 miles. In this study, a trip was defined as a movement that includes a stay of longer than 10 minutes at a location away from home.
Reaching and even exceeding 60 miles of electric range on a PHEV isn’t impossible with today’s technology. Audi recently revealed the facelifted A3 hatchback in Europe–in plug-in hybrid guise, the 25.7-kilowatt-hour (19.7 kWh usable) battery enables a WLTP-rated electric range of 88 miles on a full charge. It can drive on electricity at up to 87 miles per hour and it also supports DC fast charging at up to 50 kilowatts.",Iulian Dnistran
"America Finally Got A Great, Cheap EV. Trump May Ruin It.",https://insideevs.com/news/742340/trump-tariffs-chevrolet-equinox-ev/,"The Chevy Equinox EV is the cheap, long-range EV America has been waiting for. Trump could make it more expensive.",11/26/2024 17:00,"Americans have been clamoring for an affordable, long-range electric car for years. Elon Musk shelved plans for a $25,000 Tesla—one that isn't a moonshot robotaxi, at least. But General Motors finally made one in 2024.
The automaker just launched the Chevrolet Equinox EV, a compact crossover with up to 319 miles of range and a starting price of $27,500, once you factor in the $7,500 federal incentive for electric purchases. Between its healthy EPA range rating, manageable price and solid technology, it's one of the best values the EV industry has ever seen—a vehicle with the potential to convince a lot more buyers on the fence to take the plunge into EVs.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox.
But not if President-elect Donald Trump has anything to say about it. His policy proposals around tax cuts and tariffs threaten to dull this EV breakthrough—or even erase it altogether.
Trump on Monday announced that, on his first day as president, he would sign an executive order to ""charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States."" Seeing as the U.S. auto industry relies heavily on manufacturing and supply chains in both neighboring countries, such a policy would wreak havoc on Ford, General Motors and a slew of other manufacturers. Many cars and their component parts would get more expensive to import, squeezing margins for automakers and likely jacking up prices for American drivers.
Honda makes the extremely popular Civic in Canada, where Toyota also churns out RAV4s. Ford makes its Maverick pickup south of the border. All of Tesla's EVs sold in the U.S. are made in California or Texas, but between 20% and 25% of their parts content (measured by value) originates in Mexico, per government filings. The tariffs would hit the Equinox EV, too, as GM produces it at its Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico.
Its $35,000 price point would be harder for the automaker to reach while actually turning a profit. GM currently loses money on its EVs and has assured Wall Street it expects profits to trickle in soon.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV.
The $7,500 EV tax credit, a longstanding policy aimed at jumpstarting America's EV market and manufacturing, is key to the Equinox EV's value proposition. Trump wants to do away with that too in order to pay for tax cuts, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Not all that many electric cars qualify for the full incentive, which requires both vehicles and their batteries to be made in North America. Battery components for qualifying vehicles also can't be traced back to China, a tough proposition given that country's utter dominance over EV supply chains. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, also made in Mexico, isn't eligible. But the Equinox EV is.
If Trump manages to enact these tariffs and kill the tax credit, the Equinox EV may get a whole lot more expensive for consumers. (A GM spokesperson declined to comment on the impacts of the tariffs and tax credit.) It's a shame because the little Chevy is, in many ways, the affordable EV America has been waiting for.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV.
Affordability has always been a key barrier keeping EVs from going truly mainstream, right up there with concerns around charging infrastructure and range. While prices have come down over the years as battery costs declined and manufacturers scaled up, they haven't dropped enough for everyday Americans. In October the average new EV changed hands for $56,902, per Kelley Blue Book. The going price for a Tesla was $56,705. These are not exactly prices anybody can stomach.
There were affordable electric options before, but they always required serious compromises. The Chevy Bolt EV and Bolt EUV could be had for under $30,000 and sold in large numbers because of it, but they were kneecapped by sluggish charging speeds. In InsideEVs' testing, the Bolt took a whopping 54 minutes to go from 25% to 75%.
The Nissan Leaf is a hatchback, a body style that's fallen out of favor.
The stalwart Nissan Leaf suffers from so-so range, slow charging speeds and a weird, outmoded charging connector. Plus, like the Bolt EV, it's a hatchback, a body style Americans have shunned in favor of crossover SUVs. The Equinox EV fixed many of those issues, delivering a relatively inexpensive EV that people might actually line up to buy. Indeed, in the Equinox EV's first full quarter on the market this year, GM sold nearly 10,000 of them.
We still don't know if these policies will come to pass. Trump will surely face pushback from the auto industry—maybe even from his new buddy Musk—as far as the tariffs are concerned. And carmakers are already urging him to keep the tax credit in place. If all goes according to plan, the EV market won't keel over and die. But the road to affordability could prove longer than the industry once imagined.

Trump's 25% Tariffs Would Hit These EVs The Hardest,https://insideevs.com/news/742353/trump-tariffs-hit-these-evs-hardest/,The President-elect has vowed to implement a sweeping tariff on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico.,11/26/2024 16:00,"President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to sign an executive order for a sweeping 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada when he takes office on January 20. Trump revealed the plan on Monday on his social media platform, Truth Social, and the move could disrupt global trade and potentially cause a significant blow to the U.S. EV market.
EVs are gaining momentum in the U.S. with automakers reporting consecutive quarters of record sales growth this year, driven by a wave of new, relatively affordable models. Now this growth risks stalling if Trump follows through his proposed tariffs. Several automakers, including General Motors, Tesla, Ford, Honda, BMW and Audi rely heavily on manufacturing facilities across the southern border, making them particularly vulnerable to a policy shift.
Popular EVs currently like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Honda Prologue undergo final assembly in Mexico. While Tesla manufactures its EVs in the U.S., some of their components are sourced from Mexico, according to public records posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). InsideEVs scanned these records to see which EVs and PHEVs could be the hardest hit.
This list covers model year 2024 EVs and PHEVs as many MY2025 cars are not listed yet. Regardless, the percentage of vehicle content sourced from other countries gives us an idea of how the tariffs may affect these EVs.
Cybertruck
Dodge Charger Daytona EV (Upcoming)
As you can see, Tesla isn't immune to these tariffs. Still, it remains to be seen whether Trump will make an exception for the automaker. CEO Elon Musk is set to head the new Department of Government Efficiency and has donated millions to Trump's campaign efforts.
Trump also said that he would increase tariffs on Chinese-made goods by a further 10%. The U.S. has already imposed a 100% tariff on EVs made in China and has also banned Chinese software from being used in cars sold stateside.
Some 2.55 million cars manufactured in Mexico were imported to the U.S. in 2023, as per researcher GlobalFleet. Now, the fear of tariffs making cars more expensive is sending shockwaves across the industry. Share prices of several U.S. and European automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota fell on Tuesday in the face of uncertainty.
Japanese and Korean EVs appear relatively more insulated from Trump's tariffs, but not entirely as they still source a small percentage of components from China. But on a more positive note, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now manufactured at Hyundai Motor Group's Metaplant in Savannah, Georgia. The Ioniq 6 is entirely made in Korea.
The Genesis G80 Electrified, GV60, Ioniq 5 N, Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia EV9 and Kia Niro EV appear to use a small percentage of Chinese components. The Toyota bZ4x and Lexus RZ also use a small percentage of Chinese parts but are predominantly manufactured in Japan.
So if Trump goes through with his America-first tariffs, the big winners will be South Korean and Japanese automakers. It'll be American EVs, trucks and SUVs that will bear the brunt of the new duties.

"Rivian CEO Says The Tesla Model Y Is Still The Best EV Under $50,000",https://insideevs.com/news/742302/rivian-ceo-tesla-model-y-best/,"The Model Y sets the bar, according to Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe.",11/26/2024 15:00,"There's no denying the fact that the Tesla Model Y is the best-selling electric car in the world, but is it the best electric car available today? If we add ""for under $50,000"" to that question, then the answer seems to be a ""yes,"" according to Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe.
If we take Elon Musk and Tesla out of the equation and just focus on the car, we here at InsideEVs tend to agree with Scaringe. Some of our staff believe that the Hyundai Ioniq 5 comes in at a close second to the Model Y in the ""best EV for under $50,000"" category, but there are some other choices out there.
Best Cheaper EVs
Back to Scaringe for a moment. At a roundtable we attended at the LA Auto Show, Scaringe talked a bit about Tesla. Regarding Tesla, he said ""The world doesn't need another one of those,"" which kinda seems to paint a negative on Tesla but that's more connected to Tesla's massive market share, which gives it strong control over suppliers. Scaringe went on to say that  ""We think Tesla has done an amazing job. It's a great brand; they have great products.""
How good are Tesla's products? Considering that Scaringe has owned both a Tesla Model 3 and a Model Y, we'd have to say that Rivian's CEO is very fond of Tesla's cars. Scaringe added that there ""less than five highly compelling choices"" among electric cars that are priced under $50,000 and concluded that the Model Y is the bar-setter among this small group of EVs.
Tesla Alternatives
In the near future, Scaringe will probably prefer a couple of other sub-$50,000 EVs over the Model Y. That's because Rivian has a few more affordable EVs on the horizon, including the R2, R3 and R3X, all of which should start at under $50,000. Rivian's current offerings, including the R1T and R1S, are priced well above $50,000, even despite recent price cuts.

Tesla Has All These Covered Cars At Its Factory. What Are They?,https://insideevs.com/news/742329/tesla-seen-benchmarking-polestar-volvo/,"Eight vehicles are hidden under tarps at Tesla's Fremont factory, but we’re not sure what we’re looking at.",11/26/2024 12:00,"Tesla is very different from the traditional automakers, but in one key way it’s exactly the same: it buys competitors’ vehicles to benchmark them and reverse-engineer their innovations. A recent drone video shows eight cars under white tarps parked in a line outside the Fremont, CA factory test track, and likely that none of them are Teslas.
The drone video uploaded by Met God in Wilderness (and spotted by Electrek) shows eight cars covered by white tarps. Seven of them are crossovers, and one looks like a low-slung car, possibly a sedan or a fastback. Upon closer inspection, at least two of the crossovers are definitely appear to be Polestar 3s, based on the shape of their roof.
Another two might be Volvo EC40s, which have a more pronounced fastback-like rear end but also appear more squared off in the rear compared to a Tesla Model Y.
It would make sense to have vehicles from both Volvo and Polestar, which use the same platforms and powertrains in different vehicles. Regarding the low-slung car, our best guess is that it could be an Audi E-Tron GT or a Porsche Taycan, both of which were refreshed this year with a lot more power, range and bigger batteries.
We don’t think any of the crossovers are the Model Y “Juniper” refresh since that won’t change the shape of the body to such an extent. The rear end looks a lot more square than the tapering fastback-like roof of either the Model Y or Model X.
Tesla is reportedly working on a new platform internally designated NV9X, which will be used to underpin several future vehicles. The first of these is a crossover currently only known as Project Redwood, but Tesla would likely do a better job of keeping a Redwood prototype out of sight. The same platform will likely underpin the Model S replacement if one is even coming, but we doubt that’s the car under the tarp.
More On This
The fact that all these covered cars were spotted next to the test track further strengthens the idea that they were brought there for benchmarking purposes. Tesla is likely analyzing the competition, which has become much stiffer over the last few years, and the EV segment is only going to get more competitive. Back in April 2022, a Lucid Air was spotted doing laps of the Fremont test track fully uncovered.
Automakers do this all of the time; this year alone, the InsideEVs staff has seen a few Chinese EVs at the facilities of Detroit's Big Three automakers.
However, that was one of the rare instances when Tesla was caught benchmarking another manufacturer’s car. It was usually the other way around: other manufacturers were seen benchmarking Teslas, drawing knowledge for their own EV projects. However, now that so many manufacturers are producing EVs that not only rival but even surpass Tesla’s own, seeing the tables turn isn’t the least bit surprising.",Andrei Nedelea
Finally: This Kit Adds Apple CarPlay To General Motors' EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/742325/wams-carplay-kit-ev-ultium/,White Automotive & Media Services says it can add full-featured Apple CarPlay—and Android Auto—to most GM Ultium cars.,11/26/2024 10:54,"General Motors has pigheadedly stuck to its guns for its new EVs by omitting Apple CarPlay in its new software setup. Some of my colleagues have been mostly fine with the omission, but by and large, the public’s reaction to GM’s lack of Apple CarPlay hasn’t been great.
In fact, I can’t help but wonder if part of the reason the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX are mildly successful is because they’re essentially GM EVs with Apple Carplay and Android Auto, but I digress.
But now people who want to stick with Chevy or Cadillac or GMC have options, thanks to the aftermarket company White Automotive & Media Services (WAMS). This aftermarket kit adds Apple CarPlay back to the EVs, and it looks pretty good.
No, really—it looks pretty stock. The WAMS CarPlay kit allows GM Ultium cars to use CarPlay in whatever native resolution they need to be. In models like the Silverado EV, Equinox EV or Blazer EV, the CarPlay interface naturally uses most of the nearly 18-inch screens found in those cars. For the GMC Sierra EV’s square-shaped screen, the CarPlay and Android Auto resolutions follow suit and fit neatly into the correct aspect ratio and layout.
It’s not just for aesthetics, either. WAMS says the CarPlay kit gives OEM-level full functionality, akin to CarPlay use in any other GM vehicle. It is wireless (or wired, depending on the model). It can pass the “now playing” song list to the vehicle’s main gauge cluster. The company says it can do turn-by-turn directions via Apple Maps—all displayed on the car’s HUD, if so equipped.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite interior
I’m curious as to how this works exactly. When I was on the Prologue launch earlier this year, Honda’s engineers were adamant that the Android-based software in use on the Prologue (and ZDX) isn’t all that dissimilar to what GM is using on its variants of the Ultium-based crossovers. To me, this tells me that GM’s lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto likely only needs a flip of a switch somewhere in the backend to turn it back on. I mean, look at how intentional the CarPlay sync menus look, almost as if they were developed to completion before GM decided to nix CarPlay and Android Auto later in their development.
WAMS hasn’t exactly said how the CarPlay kit works, nor have they released a price yet. Similarly, it's not clear if this CarPlay addition will alter the warranty when installed, or block the car from OTA updates. Also, WAMS says it’s only available for installation at LaFontaine Chevrolet in Plymouth, MI.
We’ve reached out to WAMS and GM for comment. In the meantime, WAMS is already open for bookings, and information about the CarPlay kit is on its website.

I Want To Go Off-Grid In Kia's PV5 WKNDR Electric Van,https://insideevs.com/news/742301/kia-wkndr-ev-van-laas/,"Kia's electric van concept is at the LA Auto Show, and believe me when I say it should exist for real.",11/26/2024 10:30,"Falling in love with a concept car is setting yourself up to fail. The vast majority of them never become real vehicles, and those that do often end up disappointingly far from their striking original designs. For every BMW i8, we also get about 50 Pontiac Azteks. But love isn't a rational thing, and that's why I want to believe Kia's PV5 WKNDR electric van concept could somehow become a reality.
The PV5 WKNDR made its first appearance at SEMA, the giant aftermarket and performance trade show, earlier this month. But I got to see it for myself last week at the LA Auto Show. And like a good movie, book or album, the fact that I'm still thinking about it a few days later tells me a lot.
The EV9 ADVNTR EV SUV and PV5 WKNDR EV Van
The concept is a #vanlife take on Kia's new Platform Beyond Vehicle program: a family of modular electric work vehicles in different sizes and configurations. Kia has big plans for that program as it expands into the commercial vehicle space; some of the ideas there are pretty wild, including transforming body types, autonomous driving and possibly even crab-walking wheels to deliver cargo to tight areas. We don't know how far Kia will go with those technologies yet, but the Korean automaker clearly wants in on the nascent electrified delivery van and commercial vehicle space.
By comparison, the PV5 WKNDR is almost conventional. But it shows how well this platform could exist when repurposed for a consumer van aimed at off-road and off-grid adventuring. Kia describes it as ""an escape pod for extended weekends in nature"" and ""a Swiss Army Knife on wheels."" That's not only because of the big off-road tires, but because the whole interior has been customized to be a kind of mobile living space: the concept comes complete with lounge seats, camping chairs, tables, an extending rooftop tent and more. And you get towing hooks front and rear if other vehicles go sideways, or upside-down, in this case.
The EV9 ADVNTR EV SUV and PV5 WKNDR EV Van
While I didn't get to see Kia demonstrate this on-site at the auto show, the van also features solar panels for offboard charging and ""hydro turbine wheels"" that generate electricity while spinning. That's a clever idea and I'd love to see it get applied to some actual production cars. In fact, this whole concept makes a strong case for an electric off-road machine: when EVs are stationary, they can provide massive amounts of electricity to power campsites, devices and even entire homes. If you apply that idea to a bigger vehicle (with a bigger battery) you can enable a ton of zero-emission power when you go camping. I think Kia's onto something with this concept, and I hope the automaker finds some way to make it a reality.
If you find yourself at the LA Auto Show's public days until the end of this month, go pay this thing a visit. I think you'll get a kick out of it.

Rivian Gets $6.6 Billion Loan To Supercharge Its New Georgia Plant,https://insideevs.com/news/742226/rivian-6-billion-loan-doe/,"Plus, NHTSA moves automatic emergency braking mandate forward and the EU isn't any closer to a deal with China over tariffs.",11/26/2024 9:49,"It's not easy to build cars, and more importantly, it takes a ton of cash to do it. Thankfully, the U.S. government seems to be willing to shell out cash to startups that it sees potential in. The latest to receive billions of dollars of government loans is Rivian, and it's another lifeline that will be welcome for the startup automaker.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Rivian's new $6.6 billion loan to kick-start its new factory, federal mandates on safety tech, and the ongoing tariff battle in the EU. Let's jump in.
Rivian's goal to become a household name is being supercharged thanks to the awarding of a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's—stay with me here—Loan Programs Office Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. The EV startup announced late Monday night that it has received conditional approval for the loan which it plans to use as the funding source to restart construction on its new $5 billion manufacturing plant in Georgia.
A huge cash infusion like this is Rivian's key to wrapping up its much-needed factory expansion. The automaker first announced its plans to build the production facility back in 2021 with plans of manufacturing its next-generation R2 and R3 vehicles on-site. However, Rivian announced earlier this year that it was delaying the factory and would begin production of the R2 in Normal, Illinois instead—a move which concerned investors and set off a stock slump that has since reversed course as folks gain more confidence with Rivian's latest government-sourced lifeline.
Here's what Rivian has to say about its loan:
If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets.
This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.
The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.
Specifically, the loan would enable Rivian to press play on the factory by 2028, kicking off the first phase of vehicle production with an annual output of an estimated 200,000 vehicles per year—or around four times the number of vehicles it sold in 2023. The second phase will kick off the production of another 200,000 vehicles, bringing the total annual output of the Georgia plant to 400,000 vehicles and the number of jobs needed to sustain the production to 7,500.
Other companies to be awarded loans as part of the DOE's funding process are Tesla, Ford (in its joint venture with SK), and Redwood Materials.
You might have already put this together, but this loan is the key for Rivian to solidify the future of the brand. Skeptics have wondered if Rivian had enough cash (and drive) to stick out the critical launch of the R2 and R3—this loan will certainly help with the brand's cash crunch and potentially enable Rivian to see if it can thrive with a great product. Fortunately for Rivian, the brand has already seen an influx of buyers ditching their Teslas over the antics of its CEO, so the demand appears to be there for the R2's inevitable launch.
For now, Georgia is a beacon of hope for Rivian—a real one, at that. It's a glimpse of what could be and the approval for the loan should put investors, fans, and the auto industry a bit at ease to know that the U.S. government is still supporting EV companies amid a rocky political climate. And if Rivian can play this fiddle just right, it might just outplay its own cash-laden devils.
Self-driving tech is all the rage right now. Automakers are touting it as a miracle for vehicle safety, and the industry simply can't light cash on fire fast enough to be the first company to solve the problem. However, when it comes to government mandates on safety tech? Well, that makes those very same companies throw an absolute tantrum.
The latest flare-up has been around the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal to require all new cars to be equipped with Automatic Emergency Braking. This controversial topic has been hounded by the auto industry—but Uncle Sam refuses to pump the brakes on the would-be mandate and will push forward with the requirement after all.
Automakers aren't arguing about whether or not cars should have AEB or not. Most of them already agreed to make it a standard feature back in 2016. The issue comes with measurable performance goals established by the feds after Congress directed NHTSA to evaluate and establish minimum performance criteria for certain safety features like AEB in 2021. This includes avoiding collisions at speeds up to 62 miles per hour and also recognizing (and avoiding) pedestrians at night.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation—an industry trade group that represents heavy hitters in the auto industry like Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota, and just about everyone else—even said that requiring all cars to have AEB up to 62 MPH was ""practically impossible with available technology.""
""[The decision is] wrong on the merits. Wrong on the science,"" said AAI CEO John Bozzella, who urged President-elect Donald Trump to reassess the mandate. ""Really a disastrous decision by the nation’s top traffic safety regulator that will endlessly—and unnecessarily—frustrate drivers; will make vehicles more expensive and at the end of the day won’t really improve driver or pedestrian safety.""
To Bozzella's point, AEB tech isn't that great. Teslas and Hondas have been notorious for phantom braking events, so much so that NHTSA themselves have even been investigating the problem. The question is whether the issue is the hardware stack, software implementation, or limitations in a mix of both. Either way, automakers would have to dump R&D into solving the problem to meet the new requirements, which could end up costing consumers more money in the long run.
NHTSA still believes that the move is the right way to go. The feds say that the mandate will help to save at least 360 lives and prevent at least 24,000 injuries each year by the time it goes into effect in 2028.
Europe and China have been deep in negotiations over EV tariffs. Both sides are bringing their best negotiators to the table with Europe fighting over what could happen to their automotive industry should a wave of cheap Chinese EVs crash into the bloc, and China arguing for their right to free trade.
Last week, news outlets learned through a reputable source that the EU and China were supposedly close to an agreement that would resolve an ongoing tariff dispute between the two parties. However, EU officials revealed that behind the curtain, the two competing countries are essentially at a stalemate with little progress being made and no short-term solution in sight.
From Reuters:
Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament's trade committee, told a German broadcaster on Friday that an agreement between the 27-nation EU and China to replace the tariffs with something else was close. But EU officials, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks with Beijing said this was not correct, because while the talks were continuing, there were still stumbling blocks that prevented a deal.
China is pretty pissed right now. The country has invested billions into becoming an EV manufacturing powerhouse, and EV makers are pumping out sub-$20,000 EVs with ease. But, as the EU argues, China's automakers are able to do that thanks to ""unfair subsidization"" which put the auto industry in the Germany, Italy, and other bloc members at risk. If domestic players are unable to compete with costs—especially labor-related expenses—China's wave of affordable EVs will drown the competition. And that could wreak havoc on one of the EU's biggest industries.
Enter tariffs: the protectionist measure meant to artificially inflate the cost of imported cars to ensure they are competing in a similar price bracket to the EU's domestic offerings. The U.S. and Canada recently slapped China with additional import tariffs tallying 100%. However, the EU only added extra tariffs of up to 35.5%—but it's under fire because it unevenly applied these duty fees across the industry based on how willing car makers were cooperating in an investigation into subsidies.
China has since threatened to slap the EU with retaliatory tariffs on goods like pork, wine, and other luxury items, meaning that other industries could suffer to protect the cars.
That all being said, the standoff over tariffs continues. The EU is wrestling with the struggle of how to protect car brands under its protection while China wants its own shot to expand its footprint as an automotive powerhouse beyond its borders. For the public, this should serve as a snapshot of something bigger: the world sees the shift to EVs happening and whatever players dominate the market early will have a significant advantage in the long run.
While the feds are fighting the battle for safety features like AEB, I started thinking about what other in-car features have spread like wildfire across the industry. We're not just talking about gimmicky things like light-up emblems or gigantic TV-sized touch screens. There have been significant advancements in quality-of-life features across new cars over the past decade.
Some might argue for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; the auto industry might not agree. Others will say ADAS systems with great lane keeping (I know that a great-performing system is on my checklist). Or, how about phone-as-a-key? So many options.
So now I need to know your pick: what is the must-have feature in any new car? Let me know in the comments.

This EV Motorcycle Maker Wants To Produce 3D-Printed Bikes,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741888/stark-future-partners-farsoon-technologies-3d-printing/,The goal is to make high-performance components more accessible.,12/25/2024 1:26,"I remember when 3D printers started becoming popular. Back then, I remember thinking just how cool this tech would be, and that sooner or later, we’d be able to print all sorts of interesting stuff we could only dream of.
Fast forward to today, and this is pretty much the reality. I’m sure a lot of you have at least a couple of 3D-printed knick-knacks lying around. I use a bunch of them on a near-daily basis, such as my action camera mount on my helmet, or some spacers I use on my bike rack.
But what about actual serious stuff? What about motorcycle parts?
Well it seems that this is already a reality, and we’ll soon be seeing more of it in an industry that’s seeing an increasingly electric future. Stark Future, the makers of the high-performance Varg off-road EV motorcycle, is among the first to integrate 3D printing tech into its manufacturing processes—or at least it hopes to be.
You see, Stark Future has entered into a strategic partnership with Farsoon Technologies, a company specializing in industrial 3D printing. And of course, this company’s 3D printing expertise goes way beyond anything the 3D printer you have in your basement is capable of doing.
3D printing tech quite literally has the potential to make all sorts of crazy components in intricate shapes and patterns no other manufacturing technique can produce. And in the case of Stark Future, it’s eyeing advanced large-format metal powder bed fusion technology—quite a mouthful, but in laymans’ terms, it’s essentially titanium 3D printing. Pretty sick, right?
In fact, Stark Future’s CEO Anton Wass has high hopes for titanium 3D printing, and how it can not only make high-performance components more accessible, but also reduce their production time in the process. “Stark strongly believes that mass production of Titanium 3D printing is a natural next step in producing better motorcycles,” he said.
Stark aims to produce 3D printed components using Farsoon's FS721M-H-8-CAMS, which is essentially an industrial 3D titanium printer.
Stark Future’s main investment in Farsoon’s tech is a machine called the FS721M-H-8-CAMS large-format metal 3D printing system. This thing has a 750 x 420 x 650 mm (29 x 16 x 26 inch) build cylinder that allows the production of some pretty big components. And while it’s nowhere nearly big enough to actually print a whole motorcycle, well, at this point, it’s really just a matter of time.
3D printing in high-performance applications is nothing new. In fact, 3D-printed components can be found all over F1 cars, MotoGP bikes, and even on equipment used by NASA on space missions. So yeah, clearly 3D printing is fast becoming a mainstream production method.
Nevertheless, the idea of having printed components on a motorcycle seems pretty wild to me—even if said components are printed out of titanium and have been proven and tested in the most rigorous of environments. But hey, the future is well and truly now, and if all this new tech will bring about badass and fun-to-ride bikes, then I’m all for it.

All The Non-Tesla EVs That Can Use Tesla Superchargers (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/735724/non-tesla-ev-tesla-supercharger-access/,We’ve gone from just a handful of cars to dozens. And the list keeps getting longer every month.,11/26/2024 8:02,"The Tesla Supercharger network is no longer exclusive to Tesla EV owners, whether you like it or not. It all started at the end of February 2024, when Ford EVs gained access to what is generally known as the best and most reliable DC fast-charging network in North America.
Rivian and General Motors came after Ford, with many more manufacturers–almost all, in fact–working with Tesla to give their customers access to an additional 17,000 or so DC fast chargers. That’s a big win for non-Tesla EV owners, especially those who like to go on long road trips.
But what cars can be plugged into a Tesla Supercharger right now? You’ve come to the right place because this article will tell you exactly that. We’ll update this piece as more and more manufacturers gain access to the Supercharger network. Also worth mentioning is this only applies to North America–Europe, China, Japan and other markets use different charging standards.
More Stories Like This
We’ll start with Ford, seeing how it was the automaker that convinced Tesla to open up its Supercharger network. Then, we’ll move on to Rivian and General Motors, followed by the other automakers that have announced deals with Tesla.
Before we dig in, you should know that owners of non-Tesla EVs that are equipped from the factory with the Combined Charging System 1 (CCS1) port will need an adapter to be able to top up at a Tesla Supercharger. That’s because Tesla EVs use the North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and the Supercharger network was originally designed for them.
Some car manufacturers are offering free adapters, while others are asking for money for them. There are also adapters made by third parties, but bear in mind that they’re not OEM-approved.
A charging adapter like this one made by Tesla is needed to use the Supercharger network if your car has a CCS1 port.
Most automakers have said that starting in 2025, they’ll fit a NACS port on their U.S.-bound vehicles from the factory. The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of those vehicles, and so is the upcoming Rivian R2 and 2025 Kia EV6. This means an adapter will no longer be needed to recharger at Tesla stalls, but a different kind of adapter–CCS1 to NACS–will be required to charge at CCS1 fast chargers such as those operated by Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and others.
Tesla also has a handful of Supercharger stalls in the United States fitted with something called a Magic Dock connector. These essentially have a CCS1 adapter built-in and are open to all EVs, not just those on this list. Moreover, it’s worth noting that not all Superchargers can be used by non-Tesla EVs, but only V3 and V4 units that have a black collar around the charging handle.
Ford F-150 Lightning At Tesla Supercharger
Non-Tesla EV customers don’t need the Tesla smartphone app to charge at Superchargers. Instead, the automaker’s own app–like MyChevrolet or the Rivian app–is used. Owners must first associate a payment method with the car before charging, but after that, they’re good to go.
The first non-Tesla automaker to gain access to the Supercharger network in North America, Ford is shipping complimentary adapters to its customers. Sometime next year, Ford EVs will ditch the CCS1 port for a NACS connector.
Neither the Ford Focus Electric nor any plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Ford can use the Tesla Supercharger network because they can’t be DC fast-charged.
Rivian is currently shipping free charging adapters to owners of the R1S and R1T. New vehicles also come with an adapter included. Starting next year, new models will be equipped with a NACS port instead of a CCS1 connector.
The Rivian Electric Commercial Van cannot use Tesla Superchargers, as Rivian’s deal with Tesla only includes retail-oriented vehicles.
GM is selling an official adapter to owners of its EVs. Starting next year, GM’s electric vehicles are slated to incorporate the NACS connector from the factory.
The Chevrolet BrightDrop cannot use Tesla Superchargers, as GM’s deal with Tesla only includes retail-oriented vehicles.
The Chevrolet Spark EV and the Chevrolet Volt cannot be recharged at Tesla Superchargers.
The Volvo EX30 cannot currently use Tesla Superchargers. Plug-in hybrid Volvo models also cannot use the Tesla Supercharger network because they come with a J1772 charging port which is only used for Level 2 AC charging.
Hyundai said its EVs will get access to Tesla's Supercharger network either in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025. Current and future models with a CCS charging port will get access early next year, while updated models with a NACS port from the factory should receive access by the end of this year.
Hyundai Motor Group’s luxury brand said its all-new and updated EVs will come with a Tesla NACS port from the factory starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Beginning in the first quarter of next year, owners of CCS-equipped EVs will gain access to the Supercharger network.
All the other automakers that have deals with Tesla said their customers will gain access to the Supercharger network in 2025, but details are slow to emerge. As of this writing, the following brands are yet to offer a concrete timeline for the rollout:
Sony and Honda’s first EV will go on sale next year with Tesla’s NACS port fitted from the factory.
BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce EVs sold in the United States will come with a NACS port from the factory early next year. There’s no official word on when an adapter will become available for CCS1-equipped vehicles.
Honda EVs that are already on sale in the U.S. feature the CCS1 charging port, and the company said customers will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network next year with the help of an adapter. Honda’s upcoming EVs will feature the NACS port from the factory.
The British automaker said it’s starting from a clean slate. It’s stopping production of all its current models and focusing on the launch of its all-electric lineup, which will start rolling out in 2026. Owners of the discontinued I-Pace electric crossover will be offered an adapter starting next year and will be able to use Tesla Superchargers.
Lexus owners will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network in 2025. Current owners will get an adapter, while new models will be fitted with the NACS port from the get-go.
The American startup’s future EVs will come from the factory with a NACS charging port, starting with the Gravity SUV, which is slated to go on into production later this year. Adapters will be offered to Lucid Air owners and the Tesla Supercharger will welcome them starting in 2025.
Mazda doesn’t sell an EV anymore in the United States after the demise of the MX-30, but it said it will launch a new battery-powered car here in 2025 that will get the NACS port from the factory.
The German automaker said it will offer charging adapters to current EV owners by the end of 2024, although that hasn’t happened yet. Starting next year, U.S.-market EVs will get the NACS port from the factory.
The Japanese automaker said drivers of the Ariya crossover would get an adapter this year and that next year, the Ariya will be fitted with a native NACS port. The Leaf EV can’t use the Tesla Supercharger network as there is no manufacturer-approved CHAdeMO adapter for it.
Auto giant Stellantis said at the beginning of 2024 that it would adopt the NACS charging port on select models in 2025. Adapters will be offered during the transition period but currently, we don’t know what cars will get the NACS connector.
Subaru only makes one EV at the moment–the badge-engineered Solterra that’s a Toyota underneath. Owners of the Solterra will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network next year and the upcoming American-made three-row electric crossover (also developed with Toyota) will get the NACS connector instead of a CCS1 plug.
Like Lexus, Toyota intends to offer a charging adapter to bZ4X owners in the United States, while new electric models that will be launched in 2025 will get the NACS connector from the factory.
Audi, Porsche, Scout Motors and Volkswagen electric vehicles sold in the United States will include a NACS charging port from the factory starting next year. Charging adapters for older cars will be available at dealerships, but the timeline hasn’t been disclosed.",Iulian Dnistran
New BMWs And Minis Are Driving Themselves Off The Assembly Line,https://insideevs.com/news/742257/bmw-mini-autonomous-driving-factory/,"What began as a pilot program in 2022 is now a fully operational system at two BMW factories, with more to come.",11/26/2024 3:47,"Thousands of brand-new BMWs are rolling off the assembly lines every day without a driver behind the wheel.
That’s because the German luxury automaker has fully implemented an autonomous driving system that allows finished vehicles to drive themselves on a predefined course inside the factory.
The system, called Automated Driving In-Plant (AFW), debuted as a pilot program in 2022 at BMW’s largest European factory in Dingolfing. Now, however, the system has evolved and is ready for series production duty, according to the German carmaker.
More Stuff Like This
Initially, the autonomous driving setup was used on the latest generation i5 and i7 electric sedans assembled in Dingolfing, but now that the system is ready for prime time, other BMW models, as well as the new Mini Countryman, will be ferried around the factory without a driver behind the wheel.
In addition to the Dingolfing factory, the company is implementing the system at its Leipzig factory where around 90% of the models assembled will be driven autonomously off the assembly line. After Leipzig, the Regensburg plant in Germany and the Oxford factory in the United Kingdom will also get AFW next year. The new Hungarian factory in Debrecen that will build the next-generation iX3 electric crossover is next in line to get the self-driving tech.
At the main Dingolfing site, freshly assembled cars drive without anyone behind the steering wheel along a route of more than 0.62 miles (1 kilometer). The cars begin their autonomous drive from the two assembly halls, go through a “short test course” and arrive at the finishing area inside the same facility.
“Over the next ten years, we will log several million test kilometers with Automated Driving In-Plant in our production network alone,” said  Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “In this way, the BMW Group is once again setting a new benchmark for automation and digitalization of its production processes – while paving the way for future applications in the field of autonomous driving.”
The Automated Driving In-Plant system uses a series of sensors installed along the route and relies on an externally generated environment model, as well as an external movement planner. BMW says the system is the largest Lidar infrastructure in Europe and that the next step is to introduce it to other areas of production, like driving through more testing zones and outdoor distribution areas.",Iulian Dnistran
Rivian R1T Tows Big Rig Out Of The Mud To Save The Day,https://insideevs.com/news/742248/rivian-r1t-tows-truck-mud/,"When the towing company and the truck driver are out of options, an electric pickup comes to the rescue.",11/26/2024 2:33,"One of the great things about electric cars is that they offer all their torque from a standstill, as opposed to combustion engines that have to be in a specific rev range to give everything they have. Couple that with the manufacturers’ ability to fit up to four electric motors on a single vehicle, and you have a great recipe for an EV that can move big things with little to no effort.
Here’s where the Rivian R1T enters the conversation. It’s one of the best all-rounder electric pickups out there, with up to four electric motors, a maximum towing capacity of 11,000 pounds, great on-road handling and a bunch of well-thought-out features like the lockable Gear Tunnel that acts as a sort of trunk.
So with that in mind, the owner of a Rivian R1T decided to save the day by rescuing a semi-truck that was stuck in the mud and was blocking a street outside his home. Ken Kring, who used to work at Rivian, said in a post on LinkedIn that the towing company that was called to sort things out couldn’t assist and the driver of the big rig was out of options.
More Electric Pickup Stuff
Kring decided to get out his freshly unpacked recovery gear, hook up the R1T to the back of the trailer and gently pull it out of the mud. And it worked like a treat, as you can see in the video embedded below.
It’s worth mentioning that the truck driver could have separated the trailer from the cab to make it easier to get out of the mud, but in the end it was easier and faster to just use the Rivian R1T as the recovery weapon of choice.
“This moment isn’t just about towing—it’s about what EVs are capable of today,” Kring said. “Vehicles like mine, built with care and precision by the amazing team at Rivian in Normal, IL, are proving their value in the real world every day. From towing to road trips to winter weather, these trucks can do it all—and then some.“",Iulian Dnistran
Hyundai Is About To Have More EVs With NACS Plugs Than Tesla,https://insideevs.com/news/742221/hyundai-kia-genesis-nacs-charging/,"The automaker has a big leg up over rivals: Five EVs with Tesla's charging port coming soon from Hyundai, Kia and Genesis.",11/25/2024 17:57,"The Hyundai Motor Group has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest challengers to Tesla’s EV dominance. It’s still a distant second in terms of U.S. EV sales. But the South Korean automaker is nipping at Tesla’s heels in another way: Electric models equipped with Tesla’s charging port design, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
HMG’s brands—that’s Hyundai, Kia and Genesis—are about to sell as many NACS-equipped models as Tesla itself does. It’s a signal that the auto industry-wide migration to NACS from the older standard is well underway. And HMG is leading the charge.
“A massive barrier to entry is infrastructure accessibility, so I think it was kind of an easy one to say, ‘Hey, if we’re going to do it, let’s do it quick,’” Andre Ravinowich, senior manager of product planning at Hyundai, told InsideEVs in an interview. “You see the need. You see the opportunity. It’s now available. Why wait?”
2025 Kia EV6
Hyundai’s brands have announced five vehicles so far that’ll come from the factory with an NACS port, with three making their debut last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Those are the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9, 2025 Kia EV6, 2026 Kia EV9 and 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. They’re not on the road quite yet, but will be in the coming months.
Also, from Hyundai's past statements and photos, we can presume that an updated Ioniq 6 sedan will also use the NACS plug: ""In the United States, all-new or refreshed Hyundai EVs will come exclusively with a NACS port, beginning in Q4 2024... Tesla’s commitment to expanding its network will enhance customer access to out-of-home charging and fully support the ultra-fast charging speeds on Hyundai’s advanced Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) vehicles, including Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and the upcoming EV models.""
Tesla sells five consumer models, all equipped with the NACS the company originated: the Model S, Model X, Model Y, Model 3 and Cybertruck. The Semi, a class-8 truck, uses a different plug. Tesla says the Cybercab, an autonomous taxi due out in 2026, won’t have a port at all. It’ll exclusively juice up through wireless, inductive charging.
With this move, the Hyundai Motor Group has beat basically the entire auto industry to the punch. While all major automakers have said they’d switch to Tesla’s plug design moving forward in exchange for access to Tesla’s vast Supercharger network, barely any have NACS-equipped models hitting roads imminently.
Historically, Superchargers were exclusively for Tesla owners, and other cars were incompatible with them from both a hardware and software perspective. Starting with Ford last year, various carmakers struck deals with Tesla to get their customers access—first through adapters, and later through NACS ports built natively into their vehicles.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 at Tesla Supercharger station in San Clemente, California
The company wanted to move quickly since access to EV charging is one of the biggest hurdles facing wider EV adoption, Kia and Hyundai officials told InsideEVs. By linking up with Tesla, owners of Hyundais and other participating brands will get access to an additional 17,000 EV charging stalls and counting.
“When it’s something that needs to be universally accessible, you’re not helping the public by having an A and a B and not allowing public access to both,” Steve Center, Kia America COO and Executive Vice President, told InsideEVs last week. “Which one should be the standard? Don’t know, don’t care. Right now there’s more of those chargers,” he said, referring to Tesla Superchargers.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Timing was also on the company’s side, the officials said. The Ioniq 9 is a brand-new model coming out next spring, while others were due for mid-cycle refreshes anyway. That presented the opportunity to switch up the charging port. In the EV6’s case, Kia also moved its charging port from the right rear to the left rear, mirroring Tesla’s setup for its cars. EVs with their ports in other places sometimes need to block multiple Supercharger stalls just to plug in, and Kia wanted to make Supercharging more convenient.
Meanwhile, other brands haven’t been as quick to roll out NACS-native cars. Ford refreshed the Mustang Mach-E crossover for the 2024 model year, so it missed the boat. General Motors launched several new EVs this year and has multiple coming soon from Cadillac, but we haven't seen any with a native NACS port out of the gate quite yet. Porsche just started delivering its electric Macan, which also uses the old standard. Those projects were all likely deep into development when all the Tesla deals kicked off.
Lucid Gravity with Tesla NACS charging port.
However, the Gravity, a three-row SUV from the EV startup Lucid Motors, will launch with a NACS port later this year.
HMG is all but certain to surpass Tesla in terms of NACS-equipped cars soon enough. Going forward, all of its new and refreshed EVs sold in the U.S. will come from the factory with NACS charging. So existing models like the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Genesis GV60, along with forthcoming ones like the Kia EV3, should join the party soon.

The Honda Prologue's $229-A-Month Lease Deal Comes To These States,https://insideevs.com/news/742202/prologue-cheap-lease-deal-national/,Honda's low-cost EV lease deal has expanded out from California. Get it while you can.,11/25/2024 16:00,"I don’t like every electric vehicle. In fact, I’m pretty sure the rest of the InsideEVs crew would be hard-pressed to put their finger on an electric that I would explicitly like. However, I am a very value-oriented person, and I know a good deal when I see one. I’m not the Honda Prologue’s best friend, but at $229 a month, I understand why so many people are signing on the line. That’s a really good deal.
And recently, Honda has expanded this really cheap EV lease deal once only found in California to more states.
According to a report from CarsDirect, Honda’s cheapest lease deal is $229 for 36 months with $1,299 due at signing. This price assumes the Prologue is $48,795, including a $1,000 bonus for current Honda (or competing brand) lessees. Miles are limited to 10,000 per year. This is a pretty crazy deal for a nearly-$50,000 car.
If you’re not eligible for the $1,000 cash for competing lessees, the price jumps to $259 per month. Still, that’s a pretty strong deal. For a long time, this special lease was only in California, but now it’s making its way across the U.S. and can be found in 17 different states, including, strangely, West Virginia.
By comparison, only a handful of other EVs can match the Prologue’s value. The similarly-sized VinFast VF8 may beat the Prologue’s price, but that crossover’s 264-mile range can’t touch the 291 miles of the Prologue. (And I'm going to go ahead and venture a guess that the VinFast won't give you the same level of dependability.) The Toyota BZ4X can be dirt cheap in some regions, but it’s real-world range and efficiency numbers are downright lousy.
On paper, the Prologue is one of the best deals in the business. It’s not hard to see why it’s been such a relatively hot seller for both Honda and EVs in general. Honda moved 12,644 during Q3, with only the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model Y outselling the Prologue.
However, even if you’re not in a state that is privy to the EV lease deal, like myself writing from Ohio, the Prologue’s lease is still cheap. In other the Prologue is being advertised for as little as $259 per month, with $2,999 due at signing, with the same mileage allotment as the $229 per-month lease found in other states.
We’ve only got about a month left in the year. Will Honda export its $229-per-month lease to other states? Here’s hoping it’ll happen before the EV tax credit is potentially phased out under a new Trump administration.

California May Do EV Rebates Under Trump—Just Not For Tesla,https://insideevs.com/news/742194/california-may-revive-ev-rebates-if-trump-kills-tax-credits/,California Governor Gavin Newsom has floated the idea of reviving the state's EV rebates and leaving Tesla out.,11/25/2024 14:28,"California has spearheaded the electric vehicle movement in the U.S. and it doesn't plan to slow down anytime soon. If President-elect Donald Trump repeals the consumer incentives in January, California may restart its EV rebate program, the state's Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed on Monday. But there's a twist: Tesla's EVs would reportedly be excluded from the revival of this rebate program.
EV buyers of all eligible brands nationwide can currently obtain up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, depending on their individual tax liabilities, making adoption easier on the wallet. That’s on top of local and state-level incentives encouraging buyers to go electric. But Trump has threatened to repeal the federal consumer incentives on ""day one,"" falsely calling them a ""mandate"" and repeatedly attacking EVs on the campaign trail. He only recently warmed up to EVs after Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated about $200 million to his campaign effort. Musk and Trump both support ending the tax credits.
But now California's governor says the state won't budge. “Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong—zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California,"" he added. ""We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future—we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.”
Yet his office told Bloomberg today that Tesla will be excluded from this new proposal to allow rivals to catch up. The rebates would come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, wherein industrial polluters can purchase emissions allowances, which the government then uses to support climate programs across industries, including transportation. “It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,” the governor's office said in an email.
The state has sold over two million zero-emission vehicles so far. Its Clean Vehicle Rebate Program helped drive this adoption, but the program ended in Nov. 2023. Throughout its life, CRVP funded 594,000 vehicles, displaced 456 million gallons of gas and helped save nearly 4 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, according to the California Air Resources Board. Transportation emissions are public health hazards directly linked to respiratory illnesses and lung diseases.
Newsom has proposed to create a new version of CRVP to continue driving EV adoption to tackle climate change. Yet exclusion from a potential rebate scheme would be a blow for Tesla sales in the region. It's one of Tesla's sales strongholds—and the birthplace of its success. However, Musk and Governor Newsom's relationship soured after Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin. Newsom has also clashed with Trump on emissions regulations.
That said, Trump cannot single-handedly repeal the federal EV incentives. They are enshrined under law as part of the Biden administration's landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Any pullback would require congressional approval. Governor Newsom cannot revive the state's tax credit program unilaterally either. He requires approval from the state legislature. The state's budget is among the country's largest, but it has witnessed growing deficits since the pandemic, as per the California Legislative Analyst's Office.
California also wants to ban gas car sales by 2035 but has yet to receive federal approval. As many as 17 other states have either already adopted California's emissions standards or are finalizing similar regulations. However, Trump has threatened to strip California of its ability to set its own emissions standards, but he will likely face opposition. When he tried to do the same during his last term, the state sued his administration 120 times.

GM And Hyundai EV Pickup Could Be In Development,https://insideevs.com/news/742182/hyundai-gm-ev-pickup/,"The two global rivals are reportedly working together to build an EV pickup that could be sold under a ""badge engineering"" scheme.",11/25/2024 13:05,"General Motors and Hyundai have been hanging out quite a bit lately. And apparently, they like each other so much that they may team up on future technical collaborations. Given their shared interests in things like electric vehicles, hydrogen and robotaxis, that makes sense. But could it yield a jointly developed electric pickup truck?
Maybe so. News of the EV truck development comes from Korean business publication, Pulse, which cites a source familiar with the matter and builds on the signing of a memorandum of understanding that the two brands penned in mid-September.
The experiment is said to be in its infancy and fueled by an agreement drawn up by the automakers earlier this year—something which was said to potentially birth new technologies for future vehicles. But an entirely new EV platform, let alone EV pickup? Now there's something that nobody expected.
Now, nothing is set in stone just yet. The idea of a potential EV pickup partnership is still unconfirmed by the automakers. However, the biggest concern is whether the long-term relationship between the two companies can outlast GM's previous foray into EVs with Honda if a viable product actually comes to market.
According to Pulse, Hyundai's executive chairman Euisun Chung met with GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month to discuss the project's specific details. The outcome of that meeting? Apparently the world could be getting an EV pickup out of the deal.
The development of the truck is said to fall within the scope the MOU, which was to ""investigate joint product development, manufacturing and future clean energy technologies""—all of which one company official said that progress has been made on.
Here's the latest on the progress, per Pulse:
“During the latest meeting, the two leaders reviewed the progress made since the MOU was signed,” a company official said.
“We are exploring various areas for bilateral collaboration, ranging from vehicle development to future energy solutions.”
The final product will likely be the product of “badge engineering,"" which essentially means that the truck could be produced by GM and wear a Hyundai badge, or built by Hyundai and cosplaying as one of GM's brands.
Sorry to say, but it looks like the vehicle won't be destined for U.S. roads—at least not as planned. The truck is reportedly being developed for the Latin American market GM Authority points out that this means the game of badge engineering could mean that GM is looking to replace the Chevy D-Max or S10 Max, which are rebadged versions of the Isuzu D-Max and Maxus T70, respectively.
On paper, the partnership seems like a win-win. Hyundai gets the expertise of General Motors, which has decades of truck building in the world's largest consumer pickup market, and GM to tap into Hyundai's manufacturing efficiency and global reach.
The real test will be whether this truck can move past the boardroom and into a factory. These types of partnerships always seem like a great idea, but the execution can be hit or miss—just look at what played out GM and Honda's EV partnership after the release of the Prologue. But if the brands can pull this off, it's a good sign for everyone involved. And, hey, who knows, maybe something stemming from the deal will eventually make it to the U.S. market down the road.

The Battery Crisis Taking Europe's EV Sector By Storm,https://insideevs.com/news/742158/cm-northvolt-tesla-mercedes/,"Plus, Mercedes looks to cut costs and Tesla is driven by ""animal spirits.""",11/25/2024 9:56,"I feel like a broken record at this point, but the electric vehicle race isn't just about cars. It's about who controls the battery supply chain, and thus one of the most crucial energy technologies of tomorrow. As is the case in the U.S., Europe is trying to break free of China's iron grip on the battery space. But the failure of a once-promising battery project has cast doubt on that, and sent ripple effects across the entire auto industry.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Also on deck today: Mercedes-Benz is looking to cut costs and Tesla's stock is surging on what British economist John Maynard Keynes today would've called ""vibes."" Let's dig in.
Northvolt Sodium-Ion Battery
I am, of course, talking about Northvolt, the Swedish-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer that just declared bankruptcy in U.S. court. Everyone had high hopes for Northvolt. BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen and other firms were not only counting on Northvolt for future batteries but were also investors in the company. As The Information noted as well, the governments Germany and Canada put billions into it as well in hopes of future factories.
Basically, Northvolt got a ton of hype, funding and excitement for the future just a few years ago. So what the heck happened? The same issues that have befallen many battery operations: high costs, delays and multiple challenges ramping things up at scale.
As Bloomberg reported this weekend, the biggest cracks appeared when BMW canceled a $2 billion contract this summer when Northvolt revealed it wouldn't be able to get i4 and iX batteries up to scale before 2026—not only three years late, but late enough to where those models will be phased out in favor of newer ones like the Neue Klasse EVs. Things tumbled from there: ""The scale of the delays, and how bad things were with building budgets and construction projects remained hidden, the investor said, recounting how excel models and slide decks were used to conceal how empty the coffers had become,"" the story says. Ouch.
Here's former Aston Martin and Nissan exec Andy Palmer weighing in for Reuters:
Northvolt has missed some in-house targets and curtailed production at its battery cells plant in northern Sweden, underscoring the difficulties, Reuters reported last Monday. ""The biggest issue is that batteries are not easy to make and Northvolt haven’t satisfied the supply demands of their customers - that is a management issue,"" said Andy Palmer, founder of consultancy Palmer Automotive said.
“The Chinese are technologically 10 years ahead of the West in batteries. That’s a fact,"" he said.
Already, Volkswagen is taking a big financial hit from Northvolt's failure, but Volvo—owned by China's Geely Group—seems to be messing around the least here. It's moving to take control of Northvolt's stake in another joint venture. But Volkswagen is already having a terrible year, as is the rest of the European auto sector amid declining new car demand, rising labor costs and intense competition from China.
Yet analysts believe that if Europe backs off in the battery race now, it risks being even more behind China than it already is. But it may be tough to convince investors of that as the EV transition feels rockier than it has years.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
I was heartened to see that after some early EV setbacks, Mercedes-Benz is hardly giving up in the space. The new CLA-Class seems like a high-tech powerhouse that may just rival some of what we see coming out of China these days.
But Mercedes has hardly been immune to the same headwinds above. As such, it's looking to cut costs, focus on ""profitability over volume,"" invest more into internal combustion and reevaluate situations like a factory in Mexico that only makes the GLB crossover. From Automotive News:
In September, Mercedes cut its financial forecast for the year as the entire German auto industry, from BMW to Volkswagen, struggles to stay competitive amid higher energy costs, inflation and an expensive transition to EVs.
For Mercedes, weaker sales of top-tier models such as the S-Class in China, inventory clearance of electric vehicles, and costly model transitions, such as the G-Class update, were all factors leading to the weak Q3 results. Mercedes is also taking a closer look at where it is investing after it decided to build and sell combustion cars for longer than it had planned because of slow EV demand.
Wilhelm said investment decisions will focus on ensuring that customers have a choice between EVs and efficient combustion models across all segments.
With China not being the cash cow it once was, firms like Mercedes need to figure out another way forward.
Meanwhile in America right now, Tesla's stock price has been surging, up 50% year-over-year and at its highest levels since 2022. But one analyst insists it's not because of business fundamentals—it's more on the promise that CEO Elon Musk can Deliver Things® now that he's apparently become a key figure in the incoming Trump White House.
""Animal spirits,"" this analyst calls it, citing a Keynesian term that describes psychological factors like overall investor confidence. Or ""vibes,"" as we'd say today. From Bloomberg:
While policy proposals have emerged since President-elect Donald Trump’s victory that could favor Tesla, analysts led by Joseph Spak wrote that the changes wouldn’t be absolute positives for the company.
Removing consumer tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, for example, could force Tesla to have to cut prices, Spak wrote. He also noted that while the regulatory environment under Trump may be more conducive to artificial intelligence ventures, including autonomous vehicles, Tesla doesn’t have a robotaxi ready to take advantage of relaxed rules.
“The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum,” Spak wrote in the report.
Don't say that I didn't warn you.
Mercedes CLA MMA Platform
We've had several stories lately on Mercedes' future tech push and more are coming. And the German automaker seems to be taking a diversified approach to powertrains and electrification, which is smart given the current environment. What else do you want to see out of Benz as it figures out the future?

‘Terrible’: Rivian’s Longest-Range EV Tested For Its Road-Tripping Abilities,https://insideevs.com/news/742161/rivian-r1t-road-trip-charging-test/,The refreshed Rivian R1T with the Max Pack battery has an EPA rating of 420 miles on a full charge.,11/25/2024 9:00,"Rivian’s refreshed EVs, the R1S and R1T, have dozens of meaningful improvements under the skin. There’s a heat pump, which improves efficiency, and several other tweaks that are meant to make the car easier to manufacture and ultimately cheaper for the end user, including a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for the entry-level version.
The other battery pack versions are also different from the pre-facelift vehicles, and they should be better in every way–that’s to be expected from a refresh. However, as our friend Kyle Conner from Out of Spec Reviews found out, that’s not necessarily the case.
He drove a brand-new, 2025 Rivian R1T with the Dual Motor drivetrain and the Max battery pack to find out how good of a road-tripping vehicle it is. And as it turns out, it could have been better.
More Stuff Like This
With an EPA-rated range of 420 miles and a usable battery capacity of 141.5 kilowatt-hours, the EV was driven down to a 10% state of charge en route to a Tesla Supercharger that’s open to all electric vehicles. During the trip to the Supercharger, the battery was preconditioned and was ready to take in the maximum amount of kilowatts available for a 400-volt battery like the one in the R1T–250 kilowatts.
After plugging in the DC fast charger, the electric pickup refused to go over 173 kW, even though the battery was preconditioned and there was no thermal limitation on the charger side. The charging session was stopped after exactly 15 minutes, and the state of charge level went up to 36%. In total, the R1T had taken in 43 kWh of energy during the 15-minute stint.
Then, Conner hit the road at a constant speed of 82 miles per hour on the highway. The problem was that the adaptive cruise control wouldn’t work, so he had to use the accelerator pedal to keep the speed constant, like in the old days.
During the whole test, the climate control was running on Auto and the air suspension was manually set to the lowest level to improve efficiency. After just 75 miles on the highway, the R1T’s state of charge was back at 10% and the efficiency was 1.93 miles/kWh. In other words, not a great road-tripping machine, mainly because of the unimpressive charging performance.
“What an absolutely dreadful charging performance,” Conner said after unplugging the electric pickup from the Supercharger. All the elements needed for a great charging session were there, but the EV refused to accept more power from the stall. In the real world, this means owners will have to spend more time for each charging stop during long trips.
“The Rivian is still one of the best vehicles on the market today,” Conner added, referring to the R1T’s off-roading abilities, good ride and overall driving experience. It’s in the charging department where more work needs to be done, he said.
The 2025 Rivian R1T with the Max battery pack, which uses nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells, starts at $83,900. It’s the longest-range EV in Rivian’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the entry-level R1T with the Standard battery–which uses LFP cells–starts at $69,900 and has an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles.
By comparison, a 2025 Rivian R1S–that’s the SUV, not the pickup–with the base LFP battery fared better in Out of Spec’s 10% road-tripping challenge. It maxed out at 218 kW instead of 173 kW, added 46.2 kWh of energy in 15 minutes instead of 43 kWh and drove for 91 miles instead of 82 miles before hitting a 10% state of charge again.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Superchargers Are Getting Longer Cables,https://insideevs.com/news/742106/tesla-supercharger-longer-cables-non-tesla-evs/,Tesla also has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve to prevent non-Tesla EVs from taking up two spots when charging.,11/25/2024 3:37,"The Tesla Supercharger network is getting some improvements to cater to the growing number of non-Tesla EVs that can top up their batteries at the NACS-equipped DC fast chargers.
As a quick reminder, the Supercharger network was originally designed exclusively for Tesla EVs. All Tesla EVs have their charging port on the rear-left side of the vehicle, so the charging cables are just the right length to reach the plug. Some non-Tesla EVs, however, have the inlet on the rear-right or front-left, which is a problem because their owners are forced to take up two charging spots by parking next to the stall they’re actually using.
This frowned-upon but necessary move is a growing problem as more non-Tesla EVs are getting access to the Supercharger network, either because they’re getting Tesla’s NACS charging connector from the factory or through a charging adapter. However, it might soon be a thing of the past.
More EV Charging Stories
In short, Tesla is ramping up the installation of its V4 Supercharger stalls which have longer cables–long enough to cater to all port locations. In an X post, the company said there will be more Superchargers with long cables than stalls with short cables.
Max de Zegher, Tesla's head of North American Charging, added that the Supercharger algorithm now updates the availability status for nearby chargers every 15 seconds.
Furthermore, the AI and robotics company which just happens to be the maker of the most successful EVs on the market, has improved its stall availability algorithm to stop “overpromising” the number of open stalls. Tesla said it now knows when an EV with a charging port located somewhere other than the rear-left has plugged into a Supercharger. As a result, the algorithm will automatically slash the number of available stalls shown on the map because the driver of that EV has probably blocked two spots.
Another change has to do with the charging sites themselves. Tesla said it has modified over 1,500 locations so that drivers never have to use more than two charging spaces to top up their batteries. Together, all these improvements will make life a lot easier for both Tesla and non-Tesla EV drivers.",Iulian Dnistran
2025 Audi RS E-Tron GT Gets A Lot More Powerful—And Expensive,https://insideevs.com/news/742087/audi-e-tron-gt-refresh/,It becomes the quickest-accelerating production Audi ever made.,11/24/2024 14:55,"Audi has infused its sportiest EV, the E-Tron GT sedan, with similar upgrades to its sister model, the revised 2025 Porsche Taycan, making it the most powerful Audi ever. The power boost is so significant that the base model 2025 E-Tron GT now gets more power in base trim than the outgoing range-topping RS E-Tron GT. All power variants also have a larger battery pack that boosts range.
The E-Tron GT lineup in the U.S. is now comprised of the entry-level S model, which costs $125,500 or $19,000 than before plus an additional $1,295 destination fee. It has a lot more power, though: 637 horsepower versus 523 hp, and its acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph drops by 0.6 seconds to 3.3 seconds.
The top RS E-Tron GT is only available as the 912 hp Performance model in the U.S., with a sprint time of only 2.4 seconds. This makes the most powerful and quickest-accelerating production Audi ever. Pricing starts at $167,000, or almost $20,000 more than the old RS, but the nearly 300 hp power boost and many other upgrades do justify it to a degree.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
Total battery capacity for both variants has gone up from the previous 93.4 kilowatt-hours to 105 kWh (97 kWh usable), increasing the EPA range to 300 miles for both when equipped with the standard 20-inch wheels. That’s up considerably from before when these cars were rated at no more than 249 miles.
Most of these upgrades mirror what Porsche did with the refreshed Taycan, including the lightened rear motor, whose weight has been cut by 22 pounds. Audi also upgraded the front motor to allow it to discharge 600 amps instead of the 300 it mustered before, bringing it in line with the rear motor.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
The RS variant gets a boost button that temporarily adds 94 more horsepower switching to the same motor map as during launch control. This lasts 10 seconds, and you see a countdown on the driver’s display every time you push the button.
Charging is also quicker thanks to a 50 kW power increase, bringing the car’s peak charging power to 320 kW thanks to its 800-volt platform. This makes the 10 to 80% fast charge happen in 18 minutes “under ideal conditions,” according to Audi.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
So while both the E-Tron GT and the Porsche Taycan have the same basic platform, the latter is more engaging and fun to drive. Audi says it has made the 2025 E-Tron GT better to drive, tweaking its steering to feel more direct. There’s also a new air suspension setup, which is said to improve comfort without sacrificing sportiness. Installing the new suspension apparently required a special qualification for the factory workers who assemble the car.
Will these upgrades drum up more interest in Audi's electric sport sedan? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Tesla Sued This Startup. Getting It To Drop The Case Was ‘A Guessing Game’,https://insideevs.com/news/741987/tesla-evject-escape-connector-lawsuit-dropped/,"EVject makes a charging connector that allows EV owners to drive away while charging, potentially avoiding a dangerous situation.",11/24/2024 14:00,"Imagine the following scenario. It’s late evening, and you’re waiting for your EV to charge at a public DC charging station. You’re inside the vehicle and you see someone approaching. What do you do?
Maybe it’s nothing, but you’d rather drive away, just for peace of mind. Here’s the kicker, though: first, you need to unplug the charging cable. Do you have enough time? Will the person approaching you pick up the pace once he sees you are getting out of the car?
It’s a gut-wrenching experience and it’s why Utah-based EVject developed the Escape Connector. In short, it’s a sort of adapter that you hook up to the end of the charging cable and then plug in to recharge. If you need to drive away in an emergency, you just stop the charging session from the EV’s screen and then drive away. The connector is available for cars with a NACS, CCS1 or CCS2 plug.

EVject’s connector splits in half, leaving behind the charging cable and bringing some much-needed peace of mind. Once the charging session is stopped, there’s no electricity running through the charger’s cable or the piece left in the charging port, so it’s completely safe.
Tesla, however, didn’t think so. It sued EVject earlier this year, claiming that the device was “unsafe.” Tesla subjected the Escape Connector to some stress testing and concluded that the temperature could exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit after 30 minutes.
According to EVject’s founder, Kreg Peeler, that testing session was deeply flawed and even Tesla’s equipment would have failed. “They didn't use any communication connections. All they did was wire the two hot pins, which means even if we had a thermal sensor, it would have kept charging,” Peeler told InsideEVs. “The only way any adapter, including Tesla adapters, knows when to turn off is if it stops the communication pins, or if it sends a different signal across communications. They didn't do any of that.”
Initially, Tesla sent a cease and desist letter to EVject, claiming that the Escape Connector and marketing materials surrounding it were infringing on Tesla’s trademark rights. EVject removed all Tesla references and everything else that could have had anything to do with trademark infringement, but then Tesla filed suit against EVject claiming the connector was unsafe.
The automaker eventually dropped the suit, but adapting the product to Tesla’s standard was “a guessing game,” according to EVject’s Kreg Peeler. The solution was to add a thermal sensor to the Escape Connector that automatically cuts off power if the surface temperature exceeds 140 degrees. But getting there was the tough part because Tesla didn’t simply say “Do this and you’ll be ok.” Instead, the maker of the Model 3 reacted when things were wrong, without offering the handbook for what needed to be done.
“Basically, they won't tell you what it needs to be, but they'll tell you when you missed,” Peeler said. “So that's kind of the way they play, and I think part of it is they're constantly changing, right? They're constantly adapting and pushing their own standards, and therefore they don't want to be on record quoting what the standard is because it might change next week. That’s my speculation, but that's what happens when you're really trying to change an entire industry.”
Peeler said he doesn’t hold any grudges against Tesla and reiterated several times during our interview that he and his company are Tesla fans. He just wishes things would have gone another way, with a little more constructive criticism and an easier collaboration.
One half of the EVject Escape Connector remains in the car's charging port and it can be easily removed after getting to safety.
The other half remains on the charging wand and it can also be removed without any risk of electric shock.
“We just wish they did things a little bit differently,” the startup’s founder said. “We don't like the fact that there is a big public notice saying that we were ‘unsafe’ because we just don't think that's the true statement.”
As for the roughly 3,500 people who ordered the device before the whole court case fiasco, they were offered free replacements with the updated version, but only 600 or so chose to go down this route. The remaining 2,900 kept their original connector was “fine.” Customers who need to use the connector in an emergency situation will get a free replacement. Owners can extract the half that stays in the charging port without any risk of being electrocuted, but the connector is fitted together with a special press at EVject's facility, so putting it back together by hand is impossible.
“We’ve never had one complaint from a customer,” Peeler said. “And they also recognize that the new device isn't going to change anything. We're not changing our materials. We're not changing the way it conducts electricity. Nothing about the device is changing, except if, frankly, Tesla overdrives their equipment, our device will turn off. That's it.”\",Iulian Dnistran
Used Buying Guide For Plug-In Hybrid Electric Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/741969/used-phev-plug-in-hybrid-buying-guide/,"A used PHEV can be tempting, especially with the potential eligibility for a federal tax credit.",11/24/2024 12:00,"Plug-in hybrids (aka PHEVs) have been around for a while now. That means the cutting-edge vehicles of a few years ago are now coming off leases and ending up on used car lots. A used PHEV can be tempting, especially with (at least for now) the potential eligibility for a federal tax credit. But the prospect may also cause more trepidation than a typical used car purchase.
PHEVs are more complicated than combustion cars — and have complications buyers aren’t familiar with. Some high-profile PHEVs have been subject to recalls and suffered reliability issues. Battery technology and the market are also evolving. So, we don’t know precisely how PHEVs will age and how much buyers will value them when they do.
As with any used car purchase, prospective buyers must do their due diligence and answer some critical questions before proceeding.
More Buying Info
The first natural question when buying a plug-in hybrid: do you need one? A plug-in hybrid can seem like the “best of both worlds” on paper. But theory differs from practice.
The optimal environment for using a PHEV — short trips, convenient plug access — overlaps heavily with the optimal use case for an EV. Buyer fear or being unable to buy the type of car desired (a used three-row family minivan, for instance) as an EV may be the reason to go PHEV.
Alternatively, if a buyer has a legitimate concern that would preclude an EV — lengthy roundtrip commutes or long road trips — a conventional hybrid would likely deliver as good if not better efficiency, cost less up front and be less of a nuisance.
PHEVs can make a lot of sense and be very efficient — when you can charge them regularly with regular plug access. Helpfully, buyers don’t need to install a Level 2 charger. Many PHEV batteries can be charged overnight on a standard 110V wall outlet. Ideally, the manufacturer-provided charging cable is in working order. If not, buyers can typically purchase a third-party portable charging cable for between $100 and $200.
More Tax Credit Info
For now, a used plug-in hybrid can still be eligible for a federal clean vehicle tax credit worth up to $4,000. The vehicle and the buyer must meet certain thresholds to qualify.
The vehicle must be sold from a dealer, be priced at or below $25,000 and must be at least two years out from the calendar year in which it is bought (in 2024, it would have to be the 2022 model year or older). The PHEV’s battery pack must have a capacity of at least 7 kWh and a GVWR under 14,000 pounds.
The federal tax credit is income-limited for the buyer. A buyer may not have earned more than $150,000 as a joint filer, $112,500 as a head of household or $75,000 as an individual.

Replacing a battery on a plug-in hybrid is a rare occurrence. The failure rate on PHEV batteries in vehicles built in 2016 and later — not counting recalled vehicles — is “well under one percent.” But if you need to replace the PHEV battery, it’s a repair that can cost several thousand dollars. And it’s something you’d ideally want to do under warranty.
PHEVs typically have bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties similar to those of combustion vehicles. But many newer ones also have battery warranties stretching to 100,000 or even 150,000 miles. A battery warranty is great for peace of mind when buying a used PHEV. It should also help protect resale value on the back end if the buyer doesn’t keep the vehicle past that 100,000-mile mark.
All batteries degrade over time. But degradation should not be too much of a concern when buying a used plug-in hybrid — at least a recent vintage one. Vehicle batteries are lasting longer than manufacturers initially feared. Rates of degradation depend on the individual vehicle and aren’t always linear. But broadly, a PHEV battery should stay in the usable range (at least 70-80% of its initial capacity) past 100,000 miles.
PHEV batteries, in particular, are designed to be resilient. Most PHEV batteries have a lot of unused capacity. That lets the PHEV battery, constantly being filled to 100 and drained to 0, stay within a happy operating range and place less stress on the battery.
Range loss also matters less for PHEVs than EVs. Let’s presume a battery experiences a 10 percent range loss. An EV offering 225 miles of range instead of its initial 250 miles is a bigger deal than a 27-mile range PHEV offering 24 miles before the gas engine kicks in.
Testing degradation yourself will be tricky; most dealers won’t let you borrow the car, drain the battery with simulated daily usage, and compare it to expected results. The dealership should be able to provide a battery health test to determine the state of the vehicle’s battery. Failure to do that should raise suspicion. So should a posted range figure on a full charge that looks far less than what it should be.
Like full EVs, plug-in hybrids can lose all-electric range in extremely cold weather. Like in EVs, the main culprit is heating the cabin, which is hard to do efficiently. Heat pumps allow a vehicle to warm the cabin more efficiently. But that technology is relatively new for full EVs, let alone PHEVs.
Some PHEVs use an electric heater, which saps power and, consequently, range from the battery. Other PHEVs don’t have an electric component for heating and run the gasoline engine when needed to heat the vehicle. Either way, you can lose much of the efficiency you typically would gain driving a PHEV, especially an older PHEV with less than 20 miles of range.
Service history is essential when buying any new car. A plug-in hybrid can be the worst of both worlds from a service perspective. You have intricate and expensive battery packs and electric motors like an EV. But unlike an EV, you also have all the moving parts and traditional maintenance required for a combustion vehicle.
Ensure the seller has detailed, up-to-date service records and that necessary services have been performed. Like EVs, PHEVs can be harder on their tires than combustion vehicles with the additional weight. Ensure the tires are in good condition and formulated to handle the extra burden from the plug-in hybrid.
2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV interior
All cars are de facto tech products now. Many modern reliability issues are going to be software-related rather than mechanical. You want to ensure that a used PHEV has installed all of its software updates and that the interface works correctly.
A newer infotainment system — less likely to be outmoded and more likely to be supported with updates — is better than an older one. The capability to do over-the-air software updates without a trip to the dealer is also helpful.
A plug-in hybrid should not scare used car buyers off in a vacuum. Yes, a PHEV will lose efficiency and performance as it ages. But so do combustion vehicles. The expected lifespan for the battery is not that far off most combustion engines. With due diligence, buyers can be confident about what they are buying. The ultimate question with a used PHEV is not so much whether buying one is prudent but whether a PHEV is the vehicle you need.
If a buyer does opt for a used PHEV, the best strategy is to find the newest vehicle with the least wear and tear available within the budget. PHEV tech has become more capable and more resilient in recent years. A longer remaining lifespan means greater value, whether that means a longer ownership tenure or better back-end resale value.",Ty Duffy
Battery Replacement Costs Are Poised To Plunge: 'Cheaper Than Fixing An Engine',https://insideevs.com/news/742022/battery-replacement-costs-fall-cheaper-than-fixing-engine/,A new report highlights the outsize effect of falling lithium prices on used EVs and second-life batteries.,11/24/2024 10:00,"The high-voltage battery is the lifeblood of an electric vehicle. However, concerns about the long-term health of an EV battery and the potential high cost of replacing it, especially on a used model, may deter many buyers from going electric. However, a silent revolution is underway in the world of battery manufacturing. That revolution is focused on increasing the energy density of batteries and improving their durability, all of which is poised to impact their replacement costs and second-life values, as per a new report from battery health and data start-up Recurrent.
Battery replacements are rare. Automakers generally offer a warranty of eight years or 100,000 miles on the pack. Most modern batteries can last twice as long and go double the distance, according to Recurrent. And that's a conservative estimate. Tesla owners frequently report driving over 200,000 miles in their EVs, that too with minimal degradation. There’s even a 1.2 million-mile Model S out there that has undergone four battery replacements—bringing the average replacement mileage to a whopping 300,000 miles.
Most of us won’t go to such extremes. But in the rare case that you do require a replacement for whatever reason, how much will it cost in the future? Assuming the industry continues to proliferate at the same pace, Recurrent has an answer: astonishingly low!
Citing data from climate research firm RMI, Recurrent estimates that cell prices could reach $35 per kWh by the end of the decade. This would translate to pack prices of $50 per kWh, bringing the replacement cost of a 100 kWh battery to $4,500–$5,000, or about $3,375 for a 75 kWh pack. These estimates put EV battery replacement costs on par with replacing an internal combustion engine. J.D. Power says engine replacement can cost between $4,000 for a four-cylinder unit and more than $10,000 for a high-performance one. How those prices evolve down the line remains to be seen.
As of today, replacing an EV battery can cost anywhere between $5,000 to $16,000, depending on the size of the pack and the vehicle's make and model. In most cases, you never even have to think about this for new cars. It's okay for most used EVs too, but experts recommend checking the health of a used pack before putting your money down.
Recurrent further said that owners may be able to offset battery replacement costs by reselling their used packs. As of today, a service shop usually keeps the used pack if it's replaced. It will then be refurbished or sold to another company to repurpose it for energy storage, backup power, or other uses. However, industry experts expect the used EV market to grow substantially down the line, with millions of used EV owners who may be able to negotiate the sale of their own packs if replacement is required. Recurrent projects this will offset the price of a new pack by a further $10-20 per kWh, depending on the size, chemistry and health.
Naturally, all this circles back to the bigger picture: lithium prices are falling rapidly and EVs are poised to reach price parity with gas cars. Goldman Sachs said in October that lithium prices are on track to plummet from $149 per kilowatt hour in 2023 to just $80 per kWh in 2026. This 50% drop would help BEVs reach ownership cost parity with gas cars in the U.S. within the next couple of years, that too “on an unsubsidized basis.” But Goldman expects the EV landscape next year to largely depend on how the regulatory environment takes shape under the Trump administration.
But that won’t deter long-term adoption. “We think we’re going to see a strong comeback in demand in 2026 purely from an economics perspective. We believe 2026 is when a consumer-led adoption phase will largely begin,” the report concludes.
All this is to say that the rare scenario of you requiring to replace your battery pack doesn't spell doom for the whole EV ownership experience. The lifespan of a modern battery is already great and seems on track to improve further. If replacement is required, experts say it may not cost as much as it does today in the future. And even then, there are clear ways to offset those replacement costs, as degraded packs may find multiple use cases in their second life.

It's Happening: Chrysler Confirms A Pacifica EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/741995/chrysler-pacifica-ev-coming-soon/,Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell revealed plans for the battery-powered minivan at the 2024 LA Auto Show.,12/25/2024 1:26,"Right now, Chrysler's only offering to the motoring world is the Pacifica minivan. Technically, the Voyager was resurrected for 2025, but that's really just a Pacifica with fewer options and a lower price tag. Now, we learn another Pacifica variant is coming, this time as a full-on EV.
That's what Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell told Green Car Reports at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show. Design details or a specific debut timeframe weren't mentioned. Chrysler did not immediately respond to comment when reached by Motor1 for confirmation and additional information.
In the report, Feuell alludes to the Halcyon concept as influencing the Pacifica EV. Debuting in February 2024, the Halcyon is actually a sleek, sizable sedan riding on the STLA Large platform. It followed the Chrysler Airflow concept, a sharp electric crossover from 2022 that had a production-ready vibe. The automaker's decision to essentially abandon plans for producion in 2023 came as a surprise, but Feuell reportedly wanted something more modern to take the company into the future.
Chrysler Halcyon Concept
Chrysler Airflow Concept
This whole situation is not without some irony. The Airflow concept utilized the same platform as the Pacifica, which will eventually have an electric version with Halcyon-influenced styling. Meanwhile, Chrysler is supposed to debut its first EV next year— a crossover likely using the STLA Large platform with Airflow influence. Interesting.
We have many questions at this point, including whether Chrysler is still on schedule for its first EV in 2025. Delays have affected other electric ambitions from brands within Stellantis, and we've heard precious little from Chrysler since the Halcyon's debut in February. The current Pacifica should get a significant update for 2026, which likely places a Pacifica EV debuting in late 2026 or 2027.
Of course, this all depends on Stellantis not killing Chrysler before then. The conglomerate's serious financial crisis prompted warnings from CEO Carlos Tavares that underperforming brands could be cut in as little as two or three years.

"Volkswagen ID. Buzz Dealer Markups Are Here, Even Though VW Said 'Don't'",https://insideevs.com/news/741991/vw-id-buzz-markups-are-here/,"VW ""strongly discouraged"" dealers from marking up the ID Buzz—they're doing it anyway.",11/23/2024 12:00,"I'm shocked. Shocked, I tell you. Shocked to learn that dealers are ignoring Volkswagen's now-former CEO's strongly-worded caution for dealerships not to add additional dealer markup the already expensive ID Buzz.
Okay, well, maybe not that shocked. But it's happening—dealerships are doubling down on Volkswagen's egregiously-priced electric people hauler by adding markups as high as $15,000, effectively locking out consumers who were already stretched thin on their budget following the German automaker's surprisingly high price announcement earlier this year.
Recent news popped up when a Redditor reached out to Herman Cook Volkswagen in Encinitas, California. The salesperson reportedly told the potential customer to expect a markup of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the ID Buzz—when the individual iterated VW corporate's instructions not to markup the Buzz, the salesperson thanked the would-be customer for their time and ended the conversation. InsideEVs reached out to the dealership and was told that the dealer had not yet decided on a markup but it would likely be between $10,000 and $15,000.
As it turns out, that seems to be the norm.
Another Redditor posted a screenshot of an email reportedly with Castle Volkswagen of Downers Grove, Illinois. The salesperson said that ""due to demand,"" the dealership would be asking ""around $10k over MSRP."" The dealership confirmed to InsideEVs that it would ""follow the market"" and seek between $5,000 and $10,000 over sticker.
""Price [gouging] at its best,"" wrote the Redditor. ""This dealership shouldn’t be allowed to operate.""
Another two posters cited additional dealership experiences in the $10,000 ADM range. And another in Oakland, California citing a $15,000 markup just to have the opportunity ""to be one of the first people with a Buzz."" Another with an additional $8,000 on top—which put the vehicle within just $3,000 of a Porsche Macan. Of course, some were more reasonable, with a markup of just around $4,000, but that's still a far cry from the markup-free experience that the public assumed it would have with the launch of the Buzz.
The ID Buzz looked to be one of the most exciting Volkswagens in years. A halo product meant to invoke BMW levels of emotion in owners—a feel-good family mobile with a nod to the 70s that tugged on the heartstrings of just about anybody who ever fantasized about owning a modern VW bus. I mean, folks were actually excited about owning one of these things which speaks volumes for vee-dub in modern times.
Then came the official debut with full specs and a price tag. Let's just say that reception was less-than-stellar. In fact, it might not be far off as to say that Volkswagen shot itself in the foot with the launch, because the internet was straight-up pissed.
First was the price. Would-be buyers expected the Buzz to be priced somewhere around other minivans—you know, in the $40,000-ish range. But, of course, this is a BEV we're talking about, so price parity isn't going to happen. But look at the Kia EV9—Kia managed to throw enough incentives at the family SUV to get it into the mid-$40,000s, so surely VW would do something similar?
Nope. The lowest-trimmed single motor Buzz starts at $59,995 before the $1,550 destination fees, all the way up to $69,995 for its Buzz Pro S with dual motors, an iconic dual-tone paint job, and a myriad of tech-first features. That pricing put the ID Buzz out of reach of many would-be buyers, and its abysmal 231 miles of range was enough to shock many others.
Here's the problem: these aren't just grumpy customers taking out inflation-induced infuriation on VW—this is a headache that Volkswagen can't afford right now.
VW is hurting big time. Its CFO articulated that the brand has ""maybe two"" years to get it together or else succumb to the mounting pressure that is global EV brands who can do things cheaper and more focused. Its ID family of vehicles has been underperforming expectations and feeling the squeeze from Tesla, Ford, Hyundai, and others. The ID Buzz was supposed to inject some new life into VW's lineup and excite buyers. Maybe even give them a reason to try out other ID cars.
Before it even announced the price, Volkswagen knew it couldn't afford markups on the Buzz. That alone should have been a key indicator that the automaker expected a high price on the model.
“We cannot make a mistake [with the ID Buzz]. With respect to the customer, let’s discuss it. We have a good relationship with the [dealer] network,” said former CEO of VW North America, Pablo Di Si, who was recently ousted from his position after just two years. “We cannot have markups.”
So here we are, in EV purgatory with the ID Buzz. It is too expensive for what it offers, too beloved to be ignored, and increasingly vulnerable to dealer markups. If Volkswagen does nothing, it can kiss new sales of its flagship product goodbye. And if it tries to punish dealers, then it needs to use its teeth instead of just empty words.

Tesla Model 3 Performance VS. BMW M3: 'It's Staggering',https://insideevs.com/news/741921/tesla-model-3-performance-vs-bmw-m3-competition/,"The Model 3 Performance has come a long way since its inception and has a lot going for it, including its price.",11/23/2024 10:00,"The BMW M3 is widely regarded as the benchmark in the sports sedan market. And no, your eyes are not deceiving you. Despite this being a website that specializes in writing about battery-powered cars, we need to recognize that BMW has mastered the art of producing a thrilling gas-powered four-door sedan that you can comfortably drive every day and take to the track now and then.
But here’s where the new Tesla Model 3 Performance comes into play. With new tech under the skin, such as better brakes and a fancy suspension, Tesla’s sportiest EV takes things up a notch and promises to be the best all-rounder, period. But is it so? Until we can get our hands on both a BMW M3 Performance xDrive and a Tesla Model 3 Performance, we’ll go by Jason Cammisa’s and Randy Pobst’s words, which were nicely laid out in the Hagerty video embedded below.
As a reminder, Camissa is a bona fide car journalist with two decades of experience reviewing cars, while Pobst is a multiple SCCA World Challenge GT champion.
More Stuff Like This
One of the biggest issues with the previous Model 3 Performance models was their inability to run multiple track laps at full speed without experiencing brake fade or some sort of powertrain limitation due to overheating. Now, though, it looks like Tesla dialed everything just right, with no brake fade after several hot laps in the Track Endurance mode. That said, the Endurance mode limits the EV’s top speed to preserve longevity, and it shows in the lap times.
After 15 minutes of continuous driving, the BMW M3 Competition was over 5,000 feet ahead of the Tesla Model 3 Performance, so there’s still work to be done. In a single-lap shootout, the M3 was also quicker than the Model 3, but by less than two seconds, with the EV’s biggest drawback being its tires.
As a daily driver, though, the Model 3 Performance is a great sports-oriented car, not just EV. The infotainment is great, although it doesn’t have Apple CarPlay, and the charging experience is excellent. However, the fact that there are no steering column stalks makes the Model 3 “dangerous,” according to Cammisa.
At the end of the day, however, the biggest issue is the price. The 2025 BMW M3 Sedan with rear-wheel drive and 473 horsepower starts at $76,000. Upgrading to the M3 Competition with xDrive all-wheel drive and 523 hp ups the price to $85,000. Add some options and you’ll soon pass the $100,000 mark.
Meanwhile, the Tesla Model 3 Performance, with dual-motor all-wheel drive and 510 hp, starts at $54,990. But, unlike BMW, Tesla doesn’t really sell optional extras, so what you see is what you get.
Is the BMW worth the extra $20,000 to $50,000? It’s a tough question to answer. Camissa said one could buy a Tesla Model 3 Performance and a Mazda Miata for the same price as a single BMW M3, which things into perspective. What’s your take?",Iulian Dnistran
Japan’s Big Four + Toyota’s HySE Project Is A Badass Hydrogen-Powered UTV,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741431/japan-big-four-toyota-hyse-dakar-racer/,It’s set to dominate the 2025 Dakar Rally.,12/25/2024 1:26,"What do Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Honda, and Toyota have in common? Well, clearly, they’re all Japanese, and they’re among the biggest brands in their respective industries. They’re also paragons of reliability, with the Japanese Big Four’s bikes all known for being capable of surpassing six-digit odometers. And as for Toyota, well, its vehicles have proven to be pretty much indestructible.
And so when these five companies collaborated to pretty much define the future of mobility, you can bet that the world was watching and that they were gonna come up with something pretty damn huge.
Indeed, it seems that they did not disappoint, as the HySE project is gearing up to tackle the 2025 Dakar Rally head on. The collaborative project will participate in the Dakar Rally’s new Mission 1000 category which focuses on new mobility technology such as electric, hydrogen, and hybrid vehicles.
As for HySE, well, the vehicle in question is nothing short of badass, and could very well be a glimpse into the future not just of off-road racing, but of mobility as a whole. The badass off-road racer is a crossover between multiple worlds, the perfect exercise of how powers can come together to produce something so much bigger than anyone thought.
The HySE racer is powered by a modified Kawasaki 998cc engine.
Under the hood, the HySE project is powered by a 998cc inline-four engine powered by none other than hydrogen. This engine configuration is nothing new, in fact, the team is using a Kawasaki engine—presumably one from a ZX-10R—that’s been heavily modified to be powered by hydrogen.
On paper, the specs are nothing short of impressive, with 150 horsepower on tap and 200 Nm (around 148 pound-feet) of torque. The thing will power a bonkers off-road racing machine that sort of looks like an overgrown side-by-side. It boasts long-travel suspension with tons of articulation to handle big jumps and high-speed sections, as well as knobby all-terrain tires that’ll make munching mile after mile of desert trail a walk in the park for this thing.
Should this thing prove to be even more of a success than it already is, it just might pave the way for the future of engines. Heck, this might actually be the closest thing we have to securing the future of internal combustion. Forever.
Not to put pressure on Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and Toyota, but the future of internal combustion is literally in your hands.

"Mercedes Reinvents Brakes For EVs, Puts Them Inside The Drive Unit",https://insideevs.com/news/742005/mercedes-in-drive-ev-brakes/,The manufacturer says in-drive brakes could provide a lifetime braking solution for electric vehicles with multiple advantages.,11/22/2024 18:01,"The vast majority of cars have outboard brakes that are connected to their wheel hubs, and only a handful come with inboard brakes. Mercedes has taken things one step further and put the brakes inside the housing of an electric vehicle’s drive unit, and it’s touting multiple advantages, including never having to service the brakes for the lifetime of the car.
Electric vehicles can use their motors to slow down, not only saving their friction brakes from wear but also putting electricity into their battery pack. Various companies have proposed different types of brakes for EVs, from Continental’s ultra-thick mountain bike-like disks to the drum brakes that Volkswagen equips all vehicles built on its MEB platform, like the ID.4 or Audi Q4 E-Tron.
VW argues that even in its EVs with over 300 horsepower, drum brakes are sufficient for the rear. Most of the braking is done by the front brakes anyway, so going back to this older style of brakes (which is cheaper than disk brakes) is one way VW has adapted its vehicles for electric propulsion.
Mercedes has now taken this one step further with its in-drive brakes. However, it hasn’t simply taken a traditional disk or drum brake setup and put it inside the drive unit. It completely reimagined braking, and in the version of the system they showed us in Stuttgart last week, the disk is water-cooled and it doesn’t spin, and the brake pad is circular and it spins with the motor.
There is no traditional caliper either and scrubbing speed is achieved by pushing the circular brake pad onto the stationary disk. Mercedes says this system shouldn’t require service for the lifetime of the vehicle and all the brake dust it generates is kept inside the system in a compartment that doesn’t need to be emptied.
The upcoming Euro 7 (EU7) emissions standard doesn’t just look at tailpipe emissions. It also takes tire and brake particulate emissions from vehicles into account, so keeping brake dust from going into the environment will become more of a talking point in Europe once EU7 comes into force in 2026.
More Mercedes EV Stories
This seems like a big departure even from the inboard brakes that we already know. Mercedes argues there are plenty of advantages aside from the system being “virtually maintenance-free.” Since the disk is water-cooled, brake fade under heavy use shouldn’t be an issue. It also reduces unsprung weight, which improves handling.
Another advantage touted by the manufacturer is being able to equip vehicles with completely covered, aerodynamic wheels that will help lower vehicles’ drag coefficient. The system would also reduce braking noise, and owners wouldn’t be met with rust-covered brake disks after not driving their cars for a few days.
We didn’t think this was such a big issue, but Mercedes told us this specifically was something it got many complaints about. The Mercedes engineer who explained how this new braking system works said removing the caliper from the wheel will give designers even more freedom to create unique-looking wheels, but it will be hard to convince car enthusiasts that this is an advantage.",Andrei Nedelea
Mercedes Wants EV Battery Packs With Both NMC And LFP Cells,https://insideevs.com/news/741983/mercedes-lfp-nmc-cell-batteries/,This was made possible by an innovative new power converter that can be integrated into the battery pack at a cell level.,11/22/2024 18:01,"While the details surrounding the impressively efficient new electric CLA were the most important news we obtained while in Stuttgart last week, Mercedes-Benz also gave us a glimpse at what it’s cooking up for the future. Among the many innovations we were shown at the event called Mercedes Future Experience was a new type of power converter that allows for much more control over a battery pack than ever before.
Its programmable micro-converter can be wirelessly controlled and embedded into the battery pack and controlled wirelessly. This allows for control on an individual cell pair, allowing for much finer adjustment of the charge that goes into each one. For this system to work, the cells need to be connected in parallel, not in series, which unlocks new possibilities.
For instance, a vehicle with this system could balance the charge in its cells far better than today’s EVs. It could detect and isolate damaged cells without affecting the entire battery pack, and it would also allow for a much more accurate battery health check, which would easily be able to pinpoint problem cells and check their individual parameters.
This new type of micro-converter can also keep the total battery pack voltage constant regardless of the state of charge. It typically varies with the state of charge.
Mercedes explains that “research results show it is possible to provide a constant HV output of 800 volts, regardless of the state of charge and the state of health of the individual cells. The output voltage of this vehicle battery is no longer dependent on the number of cells connected in series. The number is determined purely by the desired performance and capacity class.”
If this makes it into production, it would also allow for much more modular battery packs than what we have in today’s EVs, resulting in more efficient use of space. It could help automakers cut costs by applying increased standardization and modularization when applied on a large scale.
More EV Battery Stories
During a round table talk with Mercedes’ Chief Technology Officer Markus Schäfer, we asked about the possibility of using multiple chemistries within the same battery pack, specifically both LFP and NMC cells. Schäfer told us “Yes, this is exactly the idea, to mix and match,” and he confirmed that the possibility of an LFP and NMC pack is in the cards. He did not say when we could see such a pack in a production car given that this innovation is still in the very early stages of testing.
LFP (short for lithium iron phosphate) batteries can better take regular fast charging all the way to 100%, exhibiting less degradation than NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) batteries. They also have better thermal stability and are more affordable. However, NMC batteries can store more current and are preferred for large-capacity battery packs that power long-range EVs. Having both in the same battery pack would have multiple advantages, taking advantage of both their strengths.",Andrei Nedelea
Over 40% Of Tesla's Profit Comes From Selling Regulatory Credits,https://insideevs.com/news/742024/tesla-regulatory-sales-profit/,"If a new administration delivers more lax environmental rules for automakers, one of Tesla's key profit-drivers could go away.",11/22/2024 17:00,"Elon Musk spent around $200 million to help elect President Donald Trump. It was a surprising pairing, as Trump has long criticized electric vehicles, the primary thing Musk's biggest company makes. Trump has promised to get rid of the federal clean vehicle incentive for consumers, which Musk says will ultimately help Tesla. But if Trump delivers on another promise—rolling back emissions standards for other automakers—it may hurt another key Tesla revenue stream.
Tesla earned $2.1 billion by selling regulatory credits to other automakers in the first three quarters of 2024, according to reporting from The New York Times based on the company's regulatory filings. That accounts for 43% of the automaker's—er... ""A.I. company's""—profit.
These credits have long been a big part of Tesla's business. U.S. and other government standards require automakers to hit fleet-wide emissions targets. Companies that are above those targets must buy credits to bring down their average. They buy credits from companies like Tesla, which only makes zero-emissions vehicles, and other brands that are more efficient than required by law. This incentivizes companies to beat their targets, as it opens up a valuable revenue stream, while still providing leeway for those that can't or don't want to sell more efficient vehicles.
The credit-selling business was even more crucial to Tesla earlier on. Back when other automakers were struggling to get their EV programs off the ground, and Tesla was losing money on most cars it made, profit from regulatory credits was a lifeline. Many have argued it would have never survived without them.
But in hitching his wagon to Trump's, Musk has gambled that Tesla no longer needs government incentives for consumer purchases, or for its EV and battery factories or to drive its regulatory credit business. Musk has long said that Tesla is not a car company, and that its future ambitions lie in autonomy and A.I. For those who like Tesla for the cars, however, the CEO's increasing focus on A.I. and politics is disconcerting. After all, Tesla is a company that primarily builds cars, and one that would not exist today without a series of manufacturing incentives, consumer incentives and regulatory schemes that all helped it cross ""the valley of death"" that dooms many start-ups.
Despite supposedly being in it for the altruistic purpose of transitioning the whole world to sustainable energy, it sure looks like Musk is trying to pull up the ladder behind him. That's not a great look. But when you haven't stepped off the ladder yourself, it could be quite dangerous, too.

Reuters was the first to report the news of the Hyundai recall, but InsideEVs has confirmed it affects some Kias, too.
The recall covers 145,234 Hyundai and Genesis EVs, along with 62,872 Kia EV6s. The covered vehicles have an issue with their Integrated Charging Control Units (ICCUs), which is responsible for charging the low-voltage 12-volt battery using power from the high-voltage system. The ICCU is a common failure point on Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs on the E-GMP platform, and if it fails it'll stop charging the 12-volt battery. The 12-volt going flat can lead to a loss of drive power, causing the car to suddenly lose power and speed. Here is the full list of affected vehicles:

Owners have reported losing power on the freeway, resulting in the car suddenly dropping far below highway speeds before stopping entirely.
""I was driving on the highway and a message appeared that said 'check electrical system.' The power in the car then completely bottomed out and I could not go above 25 mph,"" one 2024 Ioniq 5 AWD owner reported in a public comment to NHTSA.
NHTSA opened an investigation into the 2022 Ioniq 5 back in early summer 2023, over the same issue. A month later, the agency opened a similar probe over the issue in the 2022 Kia EV6. Many EV6s and Ioniq 5s were already recalled over this issue, but apparently the fix didn't work. So Hyundai, Kia and Genesis are recalling all previously affected vehicles, plus additional ones not subject to the earlier recall.
If you own one of the affected vehicles, your dealer will check your ICCU and its fuse, replacing both if necessary. The dealer will also update the ICCU's software. You will need this recall even if your vehicle was previously subject to the ICCU recall. As with all recalls, you will be notified directly, and the work will be performed free of charge.

Rivian CEO On Dealer Laws: 'As Close As You Can Get To Corruption',https://insideevs.com/news/741992/rivian-ceo-dealer-model/,RJ Scaringe says that dealers essentially paid for laws that protect their business.,11/22/2024 13:10,"Despite its recent partnership with the German auto giant, Rivian has no plans to use Volkswagen's sales network, according to CEO RJ Scaringe. It wouldn't want to. But VW's service network is a far more interesting proposition, as scaling service has proved troublesome for Rivian and fellow direct-to-consumer automaker Tesla. Unfortunately, using VW service centers is probably not going to be possible in the U.S. Scaringe told reporters that dealers have made that almost impossible.
""Unfortunately, in the United States it's not an easy question. We have this horrific state-by-state level of rules that are as close as you can get to corruption,"" Scaringe told InsideEVs and other reporters during a roundtable.
""I think you essentially have, like, lots of dealers have paid for laws that make it really hard for us to interact directly with the consumer,"" he continued.
Many states have protections for car dealers codified into law. They broadly protect dealers from having to directly compete with manufacturers, but how those rules are interpreted and applied varies wildly. In Tesla's home state, Texas, the company cannot sell cars out of company stores. Instead, it must sell cars online, and can deliver them at ""service centers."" Rivian's space in Seattle is similar, as in Washington the company's representatives cannot talk about pricing or take orders.
These laws were—in most cases—designed to protect dealerships from their own manufacturers selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out the middle man and outcompeting them on cost. But they are now stifling brands that don't have dealerships to compete with. There's no AutoNation Rivian or Penkse Tesla losing business when these companies sell in Texas or Washington. There's no option at all if you, as a consumer, want to buy a Tesla and take delivery in Louisiana. So these laws are effectively protecting dealers of other brands from legitimate competition with new brands.
Related Stories
The states with the strongest laws protecting dealers tend to have extremely large and powerful car dealer lobbies, which wine, dine and donate to local politicians to make sure they have plenty of friends in state government. These friendly relationships tend to correlate with laws that make sure it is nearly impossible to buy a car without including a dealer in the transaction. It's not hard to see why Scaringe says this is essentially ""corruption."" They're spending vast sums lobbying and being rewarded with laws that restrict consumer choice and competition while protecting their profits.
Because the laws are different in every state, you have to grease a lot of wheels to get the train moving. There are still states where it is illegal to sell Rivians or Teslas directly. And there are many states where dealers plan to challenge Volkswagen's plan to launch Scout Motors with a direct-to-consumer model, a la Tesla. If even one challenge in a major market succeeds, it may mess up the whole plan. Because while it's hard enough to sell vehicles directly to consumers, it gets a lot harder if you also have franchises operating as official sales and service locations.
All of the issues Rivian faces with its direct-to-consumer push ""become exacerbated if we were to use a mixed model"" where they have directly owned and franchise service centers, Scaringe says. So it's likely not possible to use VW dealers for service, even if VW was cool for it. But the CEO is still clear-eyed that expanding service options needs to be a priority, and not just doing service where you sell cars.
""You don't need 5,000 retail locations in the United States to sell three or four million cars a year. Tesla's a good example. [Its] number of retail locations per sale is far, far lower than any of the incumbents. But you do need a lot of service infrastructure,"" he said.
The vehicle's ability to diagnose and report its own problems will help improve service efficiency, as will Rivian's ability to do most service in your driveway. Over half of the company's current service visits are handled by its mobile service arm. But the fact is that the service infrastructure needs to grow, regardless of how difficult it is to navigate the U.S.' state-by-state restrictions.
""We have a service backlog where we're trying to build as much service infrastructure as fast as we can. But in some markets, the product scaling has happened faster than we can build out service infrastructure,"" Scaringe said. ""That's a short-term anomaly. Long term, we think in the United States we're going to a build a really robust service infrastructure. In Europe, the question is—we'll do sales on our own—but whether we partner with somebody on service. It's certainly an opportunity.""
If Rivian needs a service partner in Europe, I know a company in Wolfsburg it could probably call.

The letter, understandably, is poised at not irking the President-elect. There's no direct mention of the IRA. There's no mention of the EPA either, which has called for automakers to sell an increasing mix of EVs and hybrids from model year 2027 onwards. But none of this is a ""mandate,"" as many reports will have you believe.
That word gets thrown around unrestrained, sans nuance. Years from now, when you walk into a showroom, you will be able to choose from gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and maybe even hydrogen powertrains.
For now, here are some points from the letter urging the President-elect to maintain incentives for EVs and advance the framework for autonomous cars:
Support Reasonable and Achievable Emissions Regulations: To remain successful and competitive, the auto industry needs a stable and predictable regulatory environment. Automakers support reasonable and achievable federal and state emissions regulations aligned with current market realities that support a customer’ ability to purchase a vehicle that meets their individual needs. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to promote stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards.
Preserve Incentives that Support Global Competitiveness: Provisions in the tax code (including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) support the development of next-generation automotive technologies, including EVs, in the U.S. These incentives have fueled investment in domestic EV and battery manufacturing and increased good-paying jobs in automotive communities across the industrial base. The incentives help ensure the U.S. continues to lead in manufacturing critical to our national and economic security. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code.
Implement a Federal Regulatory Framework for AVs: As the current leader in the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, the US. is at the forefront of innovation that will transform personal mobility, improve roadway safety, and increase access to mobility for older adults and people with disabilities. Other countries, including China, are implementing regulatory frameworks to support the development and deployment of AVS, but the U.S. still lacks such a framework. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to implement a federal regulatory framework for commercial deployment of AVS.
The impact of this message is unclear. Trump's ""first buddy"" and Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports ending the tax credits, saying it will only help Tesla. Tesla is years ahead of legacy OEMs in manufacturing EVs profitably.
However, Tesla also netted $2.1 billion from selling emissions credits to other automakers from January to September, which was 43% of its net profits, the New York Times reported. So we might be underestimating the impact of deleting the tax credits on Tesla's own balance sheets.
General Motor's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the automaker's EV efforts will continue even if related policies change next year. Speaking on November 20 at the Barclays Global Automotive And Mobility Tech Conference, Jacobson said that the ""technology would continue to win people over."" That may indicate how GM customers are reacting to its EVs.
Around the same time last year, GM appeared to be struggling with its EV transition. The popular Bolt EV's production ended and the automaker faced software issues and production challenges. But GM has turned things around over the past 12 months. It was America's second best-selling EV maker in Q3 and Chevy Equinox EV sales have taken off.
Here's what Jacobson said, according to Automotive News:
“Many of the things that we’re doing today are going to continue irrespective of what happens with the regulations,” Jacobson said.
“We’ve got to make sure that we have reasonable regulation alongside where consumers are and where demand is. The technology is going to continue to win people over, but we’ve got to be able to produce vehicles that our customers want,” he said. “We’re going to continue to work with the incoming administration and figure out the best path forward.”
Automakers are global companies. Someday, they may be able to break their supply chains away from China, but the network extends far beyond that. The U.S. car industry is intertwined with Asian, South American and European supply chains. And while the rest of the world moves towards electrification, U.S. automakers don't want to be left behind. Because this is not just about selling more EVs, it's a race for technological dominance, a race for energy independence and a race to prevent catastrophic climate change. Sure, GM's profits come from gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, but understanding this urgency is a positive early step.
The Hyundai Motor Group made quite a splash at the LA Auto Show this week. It not only showcased the three-row Ioniq 9, but also brought extensive upgrades to the 2025 Kia EV6 and showcased a 500 horsepower 2026 Kia EV9 GT.
They all have something in common: factory-fitted Tesla charging port. That's huge because it opens up access to tens of thousands of Tesla Superchargers. InsideEVs took a close look at the Ioniq 9, which has a bigger battery and better range than the Kia EV9 and comes will cool features like swiveling middle-row seats. Plus, its interior is festooned with tech. We have a whole video about how all of that works.
Kia also comprehensively upgraded the EV6 for 2025. It now has larger 63 kilowatt-hour (up from 58 kWh) and 84 kWh (up from 77.4 kWh) battery packs for the standard-range and long-range trims. It also has a slicker operating system and a more powerful GT trim. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Kia EV6.
If you're an enthusiast, you may also want to check out the new EV9 GT with over 500 horsepower. It gets simulated manual gear shifts like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N and also an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD). Kia really went all-in with this one.
Writing a letter to Trump's transition team urging it to preserve the tax credits is one thing. But convincing the President-elect may be a whole different ballgame. Trump has close friends in the oil and gas industry who would be happy to see the EV tax credits vanish. His pick to lead the U.S. Department of Energy is fracking veteran Chris Wright.
What else can automakers do to give the tax credits another four years (or more) of lifeline?

Can This EV Startup Prove That Electric Scooters Are Cool? Eh,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741252/infinite-machine-ev-startup-coming-soon-usa/,"Would you be willing to pay $10,000 USD for an e-scooter that looks like it came straight off the set of Interstellar?",12/25/2024 1:26,"Why do you ride motorcycles? Well, chances are there are tons of different reasons why you do. Perhaps some of you ride because it’s the practical choice. Or maybe some of you ride just for the thrill and freedom it gives you. Heck, maybe some of you ride simply because you think it’s cool and badass.
Regardless of your reasons for choosing to ride, it’s always in manufacturers’ best interest to give us consumers what we want. However, it seems that this hasn’t been the case, particularly in the electric motorcycle industry. I mean, sure, a lot of the new electric motorcycles we see on social media and on the internet are totally badass, oozing with tech, and looking like they came straight off the set of some steampunk movie. But let’s be real—does anyone even actually want them?
Perhaps even more importantly, does anyone have the disposable income to risk on one these machines, especially considering a lot of startups raise funds through massive pre-order campaigns?
Case in point just has to be New York-based startup Infinite Machine. We’ve talked about this company before, and how it wanted to change the perception of scooters from dorky, utility-focused machines to badass, futuristic vehicles that’ll turn heads anywhere you go. And in concept, this all makes sense. But here’s the kicker—selling a $10,000 USD electric scooter that leans in pretty much solely on tech and style just won’t cut it. Not now. And not in this economy where people are trying to get the most out of each and every dollar.
Infinite Machine says that its P1 electric scooter will begin reaching customers in 2025.
But Infinite Machine is adamant about pushing forward. You see, the company recently raised $9 million USD through an investment by a16z, a venture capital firm that invests in a variety of tech companies. Plus, Infinite Machine aims to begin deliveries of its P1 Launch Edition scooter by 2025, an electric scooter that will set you back a sweet $10,000. That's a heck of a lot for what this is. Take note, you can get a tried and tested commuter scooter like a Honda ADV 160 for less than half that money. Oh, and you can get an actual, real motorcycle—like a Kawasaki Z900RS, perhaps?
Listen, I get it. The Infinite Machine e-scooter is a highly specialized, extremely niche machine that will appeal to people who know exactly what it is they want. But when it comes to running a business, having a very narrow client base isn't exactly the best thing, especially when you're pretty much starting from scratch.
Nevertheless, Infinite Machine is confident that, amidst the closure of electric mobility startups left and right, it has what it takes to brave the storm. In fact, the company’s founders believe that now is a way better time to convince people to make the shift to electric two-wheelers than before.
And to a certain extent, it’s true. Mobility has evolved so much in recent years, and EV two-wheelers are gradually becoming part of the mainstream transport network. But if the goings on in the industry are anything to go by, affordable and accessible are way more important than techie and flashy.
But what do you think? Could Infinite Machine just be the EV startup that breaks the mold? Or will it fall into obscurity like so many before it?

"Northvolt, Hailed As Europe’s Future EV Battery Champion, Files For Bankruptcy",https://insideevs.com/news/741909/northvolt-ev-battery-maker-bankruptcy/,"""Northvolt's liquidity picture has become dire,"" the company said in its Chapter 11 petition.",11/22/2024 3:32,"Swedish-based Northvolt, which was seen as one of Europe’s best shots at fighting off China’s electric vehicle battery supremacy, filed for bankruptcy yesterday. The company said in its Chapter 11 petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas that its “liquidity picture has become dire.”
Northvolt, which has operations in California, has roughly $30 million in cash, which is enough to support it for only about a week. Meanwhile, it has $5.8 billion in debt. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will enable it to continue operations at a reduced scale and pay employees. The battery maker has also secured a $100 million loan from truck maker Scania, its biggest customer and one of the shareholders. Northvolt said the new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy.
The restructuring process is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Northvolt Ett, the battery maker’s flagship gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, and Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden will remain operational during the restructuring process. Northvolt Germany and Northvolt North America, subsidiaries of Northvolt AB with projects in Germany and Canada, are financed separately and will continue to operate as usual outside of the Chapter 11 process, the company said.
More Battery Manufacturing Stories
“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” said Tom Johnstone, interim Chairman of the Board. “Despite near-term challenges, this action to strengthen our capital structure will allow us to capture the continued market demand for vehicle electrification. We are likewise pleased by the strong support we have received from our existing lenders and our customers.”
Northvolt manufactures lithium-ion battery cells used for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Volkswagen Group is its largest shareholder after an investment of roughly $1 billion. BMW Group was also briefly part of the investment group, pledging to pay $2 billion, but the deal fell through after BMW claimed Northvolt failed to deliver batteries on time.
The Swedish battery maker has two fully functional factories, one in Sweden and the other in Poland. Several other facilities are planned. The first customer deliveries were made in 2022, with the main factory in Sweden reportedly capable of producing 60 gigawatt-hours worth of batteries per year, enough for 1 million EVs. However, Northvolt said in its bankruptcy filing that it currently can produce 300,000 batteries per year.",Iulian Dnistran
'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To Kill EV Tax Credit,https://insideevs.com/news/741881/kia-trump-ev-tax-credit/,"“You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry,” Kia America COO Steve Center told InsideEVs on Thursday.",11/21/2024 17:11,"As Kia and its parent company the Hyundai Motor Group plan an onslaught of new U.S.-made electric vehicles aimed at winning American converts, the potential threat of losing the electric vehicle tax credits is like a dark cloud hanging over everything. But one senior Kia executive at the LA Auto Show said what the rest of the auto industry is all but certainly thinking right now: President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to kill the EV tax credit would be disruptive to jobs and the trajectory of the entire American car business.
“It would just be dumb,” Kia America COO and Executive Vice President Steve Center told InsideEVs in an interview on Thursday. “[The government has] steered the industry in a direction, and I think you need to allow the industry to recover its investments and then let it float.”
The South Korean automaker has invested heavily to bring manufacturing of its EV6 and EV9 electric models to Georgia, in part to comply with the $7,500 purchase incentive’s North American assembly requirement. It’s adjusted supply chains to meet restrictions around battery and component sourcing for qualifying vehicles. While current Kias aren’t eligible, some upcoming 2025 models built in the U.S. should be. The same is true at Kia's corporate cousin Hyundai, which is aiming to entice American buyers to go electric with U.S.-made cars like the Ioniq 5 and new Ioniq 9.
The 2025 Kia EV6 GT
Now Hyundai Motor Group and other carmakers are staring down a future where massive investments in EV models and domestic EV manufacturing are worth less. Various analyses have found that U.S. demand for electric cars would drop without the incentive; the same has happened in places like Europe as well. That would be disruptive to an industry that's invested a lot of money and long-term plans into electrification, Center said.
“You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry. And quite frankly, it isn’t just Kia and the import brands,” he said. “A lot of other companies have spent a lot of money trying to comply with the regulations.”
He said the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law that included the latest revision to the EV tax credits, has created jobs and supported the environment.
“It’s just bad policy to keep changing. So you don’t like it? Pick on something else you don’t like that isn’t going to hurt the biggest industry in the country,” Center said.
Kia EV9 GT
Reuters this month reported that the Trump transition team is drawing up plans to eliminate the credit as part of broader tax reform, sending shockwaves through the EV industry. The provision aims to drum up demand for battery-powered cars and also to wean the U.S. auto industry off of Chinese battery supply chains.
Trump would need Congress, which now has a Republican majority, to cooperate here. But it’s still yet to be seen whether the plan will withstand pressure from the auto industry and from lawmakers whose constituents benefit from new EV factories and jobs. It’s also unclear whether Trump plans to attack the commercial clean-vehicle credit, which subsidizes EV leases.
The End Of The EV Tax Credit?
Following the Reuters report, the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group representing EV and battery companies, released a statement defending the policy. “If the U.S. is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal—like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit—aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,” said Albert Gore, the group’s executive director.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry’s largest lobbying group, urged Congress in October to keep IRA policies intact so its members can stay competitive with China as the global car market electrifies.
The change in policy could deal a blow to EV sales, Center said. But at the same time, it’s not a doomsday scenario.
“It’s bad. It will hurt. Is it going to kill everything? I don’t think so, because people are buying these cars, and they’re leasing these cars,” he said. “It’s a sweetener. It aids mass adoption.”
Kia EV9 GT
At the moment, Kia doesn’t sell any vehicles that qualify for the full buying credit, though it plans to. Building the EV9 and EV6 in the U.S. should help it get there. Its customers can benefit from the $7,500 leasing incentive, which doesn’t enforce eligibility or manufacturing requirements for vehicles.
Getting rid of the EV purchase incentive may not have a huge impact in part because of the policy’s household income requirements, Center said. Plus, charging infrastructure is still the main barrier to adoption, in his view.
He said that if the administration kills the tax credit, they should at least do so gradually. “It’s messed up,” Center said. “But I would say if you must eliminate it, have a ramp down.”

Citroen’s DS Teases Slippery 466-Mile Electric Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/741874/ds8-electric-fastback-crossover-teaser/,"Even though the information came to us in a partly redacted form, we’re excited about the fancy new tall fastback from DS.",11/21/2024 15:00,"Automakers are always looking for new and innovative ways to build anticipation for something they’re about to release and/or are especially proud of. We’ve seen all possible parts of a car teased and even car brand revamps presented like they were fashion shows, but now DS is blanking out words in the press release for a new model.
Its upcoming posh tall fastback EV will have a claimed WLTP range of 466 miles (750 km)... and other features that we can only guess by the length of the word.
The thing about the press release is that the blacked-out words look like an afterthought, not a marketing department’s brilliant idea to create hype in a new way—it looks like they decided to conceal these things at the last moment. What could DS be hiding in between the vehicle’s matrix LED lights, and what could they be framing that it needed to be redacted?
Not that the upcoming crossover, which may be called the DS8, isn’t cool. The teaser shots show a lightly camouflaged prototype wearing its production body, sporting aggressive fascias and a very dramatic roofline. Its boomerang-like front and rear light clusters define the corners of the car in a similar way to how Cadillac does it in its latest models.
The upcoming DS8 is the production version of the DS Aero Sport Lounge concept unveiled back in 2020 when it was touted as turning travel into art. Even though it’s a high-riding vehicle, DS still touts a 0.24 drag coefficient, which goes some way toward explaining the range advantage it has over other vehicles built on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform.
It will likely get the same 96.9 kWh (usable) battery as other related models, like the Peugeot 3008 EV, whose range rating in Europe is 434 miles (700 km), or 32 miles (50 km) less. Charging from 20 to 80% takes the Peugeot 27 minutes, and 93 miles (150 km) can be added in 10 minutes.
More On This
You can’t get the electric Peugeot 3008 with the long-range battery and all-wheel drive. The big-battery model is only available in single-motor configuration with 227 horsepower. The 321 hp dual-motor 3008 has a smaller 73 kWh battery. This means that DS has either found a way of pairing the dual-motor setup with the big battery or the DS8 will be front-wheel drive.
DS announced a few years ago that it was only going to launch pure-electric vehicles after 2024. However, in light of recent trends shown by the EV market, DS could switch back to combustion given that the STLA Medium platform can also take combustion powertrains with all levels of electrification (mild hybrid, hybrid and plug-in hybrid), so we can’t rule that out—Peugeot offers the 3008 and 5008 as plug-in hybrids.
The manufacturer says it will reveal more about the upcoming model before the end of the year. We really hope to learn what it is that the driver’s seat provides that we were not ready to see yet.",Andrei Nedelea
The Rivian R2 And R3 Probably Won't Be 800-Volt,https://insideevs.com/news/741862/rivian-r2-r3-800v-400v/,Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told reporters that the company can deliver competitive charge times on a 400-volt system.,11/21/2024 14:00,"Rivian has not yet announced whether its forthcoming R2 and R3 midsize cars will use a 400-volt architecture or a more expensive 800- or 900-volt system. Fans may be hoping that the next generation of products will move to a higher-voltage architecture, which typically can allow for faster charging and more efficiency. But after sitting down with Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, I don't think that's likely.
In a roundtable with reporters, Scaringe said that while there are benefits to going 800-volt, they're more important for bigger batteries. Larger packs—like those in the R1—are more likely to be voltage-constrained. But with a smaller pack like we're expecting to see in the R2 and R3, Scaringe says battery chemistry is a bigger limiter than voltage.
In the R2, the move is ""just not as critical,"" he said. ""R2 we've optimized more around cost, to make sure we deliver great performance but [at] these price points. I don't think it's as important in a smaller vehicle.
He stopped short of confirming directly that the products would be on a 400-volt architecture, but he sounded quite convinced that an 800-volt system wasn't necessary for R2 or R3. The larger R1 will ""need to transition"" to an 800- or 900-volt setup, he said, but didn't say when. Such a substantial change is unlikely until the vehicle's next redesign.
Hyundai, Kia, Lucid and Porsche have all been bullish on 800- or 900-volt architectures. Their cars show why the technology is appealing: A relatively affordable Hyundai Ioniq 6 can zip from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes. A Porsche Taycan can do it in 16. That's blazing fast. But Scaringe says that the focus on voltage is misplaced. While an 800-volt pack can deliver charging speeds of 350 kW or higher, in most smaller or mid-size vehicles the voltage isn't the limiter.
""We think ultimately the charge times need to be sub-20 minutes for that 10-80 time. We're 100% aligned on that. You can get there with [400v],"" he said. A 450-volt charger running at 500 amps can deliver 225 kW. If a car with a sub-100-kWh pack could sustain those speeds, it'd be capable of doing 10-80% in 20 minutes. Look no further than Hyundai for proof. Despite its 800-volt architecture, a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Ioniq 6 will ""only"" peak around 220-230 kW. Some 400-volt cars like the Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1 can hit similar numbers. The Hyundais just hold higher speeds for longer, allowing for those ultra-fast charge times.
But that shows that the voltage isn't really the problem. Many existing battery packs just cannot accept that much energy for long enough to deliver those sorts of times. An 800-volt system would probably help, but cell chemistry and battery cooling is more important, Scaringe says. He didn't mention it, but the implication is that its ""4695"" cylindrical sells the company plans to use in the R2 and R3 should have better thermals than existing batteries.
We'll see if they're good enough to hit the sub-20-minute charge time goal. Right now, Rivian has only claimed that the R2 and R3 will be able to do a 10-80% charge in ""under 30 minutes."" Getting to a sub-20 time is a much tougher challenge. Given that Scaringe noted it as a long-term goal rather than a promise, there's no word on whether the R2 or R3 will get there. If they do, though, it likely won't be with the help of an 800-volt architecture.

"You're Welcome, Tesla Owners. Kia Just Moved Its Charging Port",https://insideevs.com/news/741740/kia-ev6-charging-port-tesla/,"Kia moved the charging port on the 2025 EV6 to the left side of the vehicle, which should make for smoother Supercharger access.",11/21/2024 13:00,"Kia will move the charging port on the 2025 EV6 crossover to the left side of the vehicle from the right side, the brand announced on Thursday. If you ask the Tesla owners who will soon share their beloved Supercharger stations with Kia drivers and many others, that's the right side to have it on.
That update comes as part of a wider refresh to the EV6 that broke cover on Thursday. The 2025 model gets a new mug, more range and, perhaps most importantly, a Tesla-style charging port built right in. Thanks to an integrated North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, the EV6 will soon be able to charge up at thousands of Tesla Superchargers without using a dongle of any kind. That access opens up in January.
Read Up On The NACS Transition
But simply working with Tesla to grant Supercharger access (they used to be reserved for Tesla owners only, but that's gradually changing) doesn't guarantee the charging process at those locations will easy or hiccup-free. Since Tesla began letting outsiders use its stations, it's become clear that the location of a car's charging port can make or break the charging experience—both for the car's owner and the station's other patrons.
2025 Kia EV6
Supercharger stalls are designed with short cords and for Teslas only, and all Teslas have their charging port at the back left of the vehicle. So when a non-Tesla shows up with its port in the ""wrong"" place, the owner can't simply back into the appropriate spot like a Model Y or Model 3 could. They may have to straddle two parking spaces or park horizontally across them just to get the cord to reach.
Understandably, that's been pissing off Tesla owners left and right. It's awkward for the person causing the nuisance too.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line.
Enter Kia. The brand not only gave the 2025 EV6 a NACS port—it also relocated the port the left rear fender to mimic Tesla's setup. (The high-performance EV6 GT won't get the same update, however.) Kia didn't explicitly mention the parking problem in its press release, only saying that the new port and location serve to ""make charging more convenient.""
But everybody knows this is an issue, including Tesla. On its website, it recommends that non-Tesla owners ""avoid parking diagonally to reach the cable and try to obstruct as few charge posts as possible,"" and shows how they should do so in a handy illustration.
""Additionally, we encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side,"" Tesla adds.
This may only be a temporary bug of the great NACS transition, though. Gas stations have no problem dealing with cars that have their gas caps on either side of the vehicle. We're starting to see EV charging stations with that kind of pull-through design coming online too. And Tesla says its new V4 charging cabinets will better accommodate other EVs.

Our Long-Term Kia EV6 Testing",Tim Levin
The 2025 Kia EV6 GT Gets Ioniq 5 N-Style 'Virtual Gear Shift',https://insideevs.com/news/741857/kia-ev6-gt-virtual-shifter/,"Simulated gear shifts will pair well with 641 horsepower, don't you think?",11/21/2024 12:50,"Just admit it: you love the idea of simulated gear shifting in electric vehicles. Oh, you may act like you hate the anachronistic idea of changing ""gears"" in a car that technically only has a one-speed transmission because it ruins the ""purity"" of the smooth and efficient EV experience. Or maybe you're a gas car purist and the idea of trying to simulate a transmission is, at best, like watching a clip of your favorite band on someone's Instagram reel when you could have had a front-row seat to the show instead.
But deep down, you know you're wrong. And you wish every EV could do that. How do I know this? Because every single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all.
Even Jeremy Clarkson calls the Ioniq 5 N ""as much fun as is humanly possible."" Jeremy Clarkson! A man who made an entire career out of being very mad that it's not 1968 anymore. Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red
And joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut today at the LA Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature.
""The GT’s new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,"" Kia officials said in a news release. And that's all they have to say for now, but we'll try and get more at the show itself if we can.
Since Kia and Hyundai are owned by the same parent company but are technically separate entities, the news release does not mention the Ioniq 5 N. Yet it's clear that something similar will now be added to the Ioniq 5's platform-mate, the EV6. And on the Hyundai, the ""N e-Shift"" feature really goes the distance.
2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N First Drive Review
That car simulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission using the paddles normally used to adjust regenerative braking intensity on other Hyundai Motor Group cars. When activated—and it has a normal ""drive"" setting as any DCT would—it works much the same way: left paddle to go down a ""gear,"" right to go up. Of course, the EVs do not have multiple forward gears. They have so much instant torque that gears are not necessary to achieve different speeds as they would be on a gas engine, which puts power to the wheels far less efficiently.
But the Ioniq 5 N is also special for how it simulates the ""feel"" of gear shifting, including the jolt and brief interruption in power that happens and the mechanical resistance that's normal upon downshifting. The Ioniq 5 N also simulates engine sounds through the speakers, will let you rev the ""engine"" while parked and has a ""redline"" you'll hit before you need to shift again. It's all great fun.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red
Based on Kia's statement, we can expect some version of that for the EV6, but I'm eager to see Kia's spin on things. I'm sure engineers will find some way to make it fairly unique to this car.
Beyond that, we know a few other specs, including power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. With GT Mode activated, you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque. Unlike the rest of the EV6 line, the GT will still be made in South Korea, not Kia's Georgia factory, so it won't qualify for U.S. EV tax credits at purchase. Pricing has not been released yet, nor have official photos: what you see above is the European-spec Kia EV6 GT-Line, which is visually similar.
So now we're all wondering the same thing, right? The new Kia EV6 GT, or the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N? We have reason to believe the Kia is a hotted-up version of the existing model with a ton of extra power and some new tricks, while the Hyundai is a top-to-bottom performance car rework that's meant for track day duty. But the EV6 GT may still be no slouch. This a showdown we'll have to take to the track in 2025 so we can find out.

"2026 Kia EV9 GT: Sporty Electric SUV With Native Tesla NACS Port, Virtual Gear Shifts",https://insideevs.com/news/741837/2026-kia-ev9-gt-specs-nacs-port/,Meet Kia’s most powerful three-row SUV. It just happens to be electric.,11/21/2024 12:45,"This is the all-new 2026 Kia EV9 GT. Not to be confused with the EV9 GT-Line which was already available with some sporty-looking hardware, the newly introduced version is Kia’s most powerful production three-row SUV.
Boasting a dual-motor powertrain with a total estimated output of 510 horsepower, the Kia EV9 GT is 122 hp more powerful than the EV9 GT-Line. That’s enough to propel the sporty electric family hauler from zero to 60 miles per hour in an estimated 4.3 seconds, seven-tenths of a second quicker than the GT-Line.
The front motor of the EV9 GT makes 214 hp while the rear drive unit pumps out 362 hp, but because they don’t reach peak power at the same time, you can’t just add the numbers together. The torque figure was not disclosed by the Korean automaker.

Kia’s go-fast family hauler adopts a rather controversial feature from the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N–Virtual Gear Shifts. We quite liked the simulated gear shifts when we drove the refreshed Ioniq 5 N, but there are plenty of people out there who think an EV–which doesn’t actually have gears–shouldn’t try to impersonate a gas-powered car. This includes some folks at Porsche who said such a feature will only make their cars worse.
The system works in conjunction with the in-cabin electric Active Sound Design (e-ASD) system to make it feel like the car shifts through gears while accelerating. The EV jolts when it goes from one virtual gear to another and the sound system provides the audio cues to tie it all together.
The EV9 GT is Kia’s first three-row SUV to get electronically controlled suspension or ECS. This can soften or harden the suspension damping based on what driving mode has been selected: Normal, Eco, Sport or My Drive. These modes also alter the steering and brake feel. Speaking of brakes, the flagship EV9 gets larger front rotors than the lesser versions.
At the rear, there’s an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD), just like on the EV6 GT, which limits wheelspin to the tires with less grip. Meanwhile, the 7.8-inch ground clearance is the same as on the other trim levels, as is the 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity of the GT-Line.
Just like the new Hyundai Ioniq 5, Genesis Electrified GV70 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, the 2026 Kia EV9 GT comes with Tesla’s NACS charging port from the factory. This means owners will be able to charge at Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network without an adapter. However, an adapter will be needed to charge at DC fast chargers with CCS plugs, like the vast majority of stalls operated by companies like EVgo, Electrify America and ChargePoint.
Kia said that all EV9 versions will come as standard with the NACS charging port starting in the first half of next year. The battery of the EV9 GT is the same as on the other long-range versions–99.8 kilowatt-hours–but the automaker hasn’t provided a range rating or a maximum charging speed. For reference, the EV9 GT-Line has an EPA-rated range of 270 miles and can accept up to 235 kW from a DC fast charger, enough for a 10% to 80% top-up in less than 25 minutes.
“The EV9 has been a home run for Kia and introduced the first mass-market electric three-row SUV,” said Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America. “And EV9 GT includes all those wonderful elements while amping up the fun factor significantly. This new halo trim is set to spark the hearts of driving enthusiasts who still need the practicality of a six-passenger SUV. You can have your cake and eat it too!”
Outside, the 2026 Kia comes with 21-inch wheels wrapped in 285/45R21 high-performance Continental tires. The brake calipers are painted in neon green and GT-exclusive patterns on the Active Air Flaps in front.
Inside, the cabin is adorned with bright green accents, including on the steering wheel and seats, both of which are unique to the EV9 GT. The standard kit includes Parking Collision Assist with front, side and rear monitoring, as well as Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Navigation-based Smart Cruise Control and others.
Pricing for the 2026 Kia EV9 GT has not been announced yet. However, we know it will go on sale in the latter half of next year. We also know that it will be assembled in South Korea, so any potential federal tax credit when purchasing goes out the window (leasing might make it eligible for a tax credit, if there will still be a tax credit for EVs in 2025.)",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Kia EV6: Made In America With A Tesla NACS Plug, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741756/2025-kia-ev6-specs-us/,Kia's groundbreaking EV6 makes a big comeback for 2025. The new face isn't even the big story here.,11/21/2024 12:45,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 gets a lot of well-deserved glory in the electric vehicle space. But personally, I'm more a fan of its cousin, the Kia EV6. So much so that I bought one earlier this year and am strongly considering acquiring it outright whenever my lease is up. But when I look at the changes coming with the updated 2025 Kia EV6, I may just have to consider an upgrade.
What's better now about Kia's electric crossover? Basically, everything. The EV6 will now be built in the U.S. to qualify for at least some EV tax credits; packs more range thanks to a bigger battery; offers a redesigned face and interior; and will come out of the gate with a newly-relocated Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to that vast network of DC fast-chargers.
There's a lot to cover here, so let's dig in.
The EV6 originally debuted way back in 2021 and now sees its most substantive update yet. We've already seen its newly redesigned face—a ""Star Map"" grille designed to more closely match other modern Kia offerings—as the second-generation model has been on sale for a few months in places like Europe and its native South Korea. But the U.S.-spec version comes with more surprises than we anticipated.
The EV6 now gets two battery options in larger sizes than the previous car, offering more range. The base, smaller battery is now 63 kilowatt-hours in size, up from 58 kWh previously, while the larger battery goes from 77.4 kWh to 84 kWh. While exact range figures for each trim level have not been released, Kia claims the Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line models will target 319 miles of range in rear-wheel-drive configuration.
2025 Kia EV6
There's no word yet on range for the dual-motor all-wheel-drive models, unfortunately. But we're expecting all range figures to be generally similar to the 2025 Ioniq 5 that uses the same battery setups, so likely around 290 or more miles of range for the AWD versions. Either way, those should be decent upgrades from the current EV6; the RWD models are currently listed at 310 miles of EPA-rated range and 282 for AWD models (which drops to 252 and 218 miles for the GT-Line and GT variants, respectively.) Considering that my own EV6 Wind AWD regularly tops 300 miles of range on a 100% charge when the weather is fair, those could be much more consistently above that.
Power is roughly similar across the board, however. The Light RWD model is rated at 167 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque, while more powerful RWD models in Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line forms come in at 225 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. Upgrading to AWD gets you 320 hp and 446 lb.-ft. of torque as before.
But I'm happy to say the go-fast Kia EV6 GT gets even more powerful now, which it absolutely didn't need, but nobody's going to say no to more power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. Turn on GT Mode and you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque to adequately meet any Lamborghini-hunting needs that may arise in your community.
2025 Kia EV6
I'll readily admit I'm not the biggest fan of the updated grille. But the EV6 still looks as sharp as ever, and it offers more than just a new face here. The taillights also add Star Map details, while the front and rear bumper have new designs with sharper angles and a more aggressive overall stance. Kia's also offering new designs for its 19- to 21-inch wheels.
2025 Kia EV6
The inside is pretty familiar but with a few notable tweaks. The steering wheel has been totally redesigned, and the EV6 finally gets the fully updated Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) operating system that offers quicker speeds, higher-definiton graphics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates—something the current EV6 has only done with navigation and a handful of other core features. Basically, the software setup on the EV6 now mirrors that of the EV9, which gets high marks from us. And like the EV9, you now get access to the new Kia Connect Store for downloads like displays themed after your favorite NBA teams. (Yes, really.) The Digital Key setup has been improved to offer true smartphone-activated door unlocking, remote starting and driving.
And finally, the flush door handles now pop open automatically across all trim levels. That fixes one of my biggest gripes about the current EV6 and may justify an upgrade on that alone.
Kia's unfortunately not telling us much about the EV6's legendary fast-charging. The car can go from a 10% charge to 80% in just about 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast-charger, and we don't expect that to change. However, like the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and updated Genesis Electrified GV70 that also debuted at the LA Auto Show this week, the revised EV6 packs a NACS plug from the factory now. And it's been moved to the other side of the car—the driver's side instead of the passenger's—to make charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations a little easier.
2025 Kia EV6
And best of all, the revised EV6 is now American-made, just like the 2025 Ioniq 5. This one is made at Kia's West Point, Georgia assembly plant alongside the EV9, so it should qualify for at least some of the $7,500 EV tax credits when purchased. Those may soon vanish, so take advantage of them while you can. (The EV6 GT will continue to be built in Korea.)
Kia says that like the outgoing car, the 2025 EV6 will be available in Light (RWD only), Light Long Range (RWD or AWD), Wind (RWD or AWD), GT-Line (RWD or AWD), and GT (AWD) trims. The automaker says it's expected to go on sale in the first half of next year. Pricing and other specs will be announced at a later date.
All in all, the 2025 model year represents a big upgrade for one of the best-equipped, best-looking and best-performing EVs in its class. Expect more on this as we get it.

Rivian's CEO Thinks It Can Be Besties With Scout,https://insideevs.com/news/741730/rivian-rj-scaringe-scout-coexist/,"Plus, Lucid isn't scared of tax credits going away and Lotus abandons its all-EV approach.",11/21/2024 11:08,"Have you thought about how small the EV segment really is? Today, fewer than one in ten new vehicles sold in the U.S. are BEVs. Now start to think about what kind of buyer each EV attracts—you've got high-ranking execs picking up Porsches, glamping outdoorsy folk looking at Rivian and then there's anyone not looking at a Tesla scoping out GM and VW. Niches exist, which is exactly what Rivian's CEO is banking on being what separates its customers from others and allows the brand to coexist.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Rivian and Scout's budding bromance, Lucid scoffing at the EV tax credit kerfuffle, plus, Lotus scrapping its EV-only plan in favor of EREVs. Let's jump in
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been playing it surprisingly cool as Volkswagen brings its new rough-and-tough brand up to bat. See, Scout is really the first true competitor for Rivian—sure, other EVs exist, but Scout is the first brand to bring strong, rugged battery power in the shape of a truck and blend the lifestyle component along with it.
The threat of competition hasn't fazed Scaringe, though. In fact, in a recent media roundtable, the CEO even nodded to the notion of the two brands coexisting without problem. Why, you might ask? Well, according to Electrek, Scaringe says there are ""less than five"" compelling EVs in the sub-$50,000 price range, which should make differentiating itself from the competition by simply making a better product surprisingly easy.
You may have noticed that Rivian and Scout have been getting awfully cozy lately. You can thank Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen for that, as this move has enabled Scout to take advantage of the new Rivian-sourced tech—namely the zonal architecture—which is available as part of the agreement. While great news for all involved, the tech sharing has blurred the line between brands a bit, which means that we should once again shout this from the rooftops: Rivian and Scout are not the same.
Not the same brand, not the same chassis, not even the same underpinnings outside of the zonal architecture and some software. Hell, despite some overlap, the two brands aren't even targeting same target audience. Rivian is marketing to EV enthusiasts with active outdoor lifestyles, while Scout is banking on nostalgia to sell an efficient blue-collar work truck. It's like Patagonia jacket versus Carhartt overalls—and that's why they can coexist.
Scaringe's optimism isn't without warrant. The EV segment still makes up less than 10% of America's new vehicle registrations, which makes it still pretty small. And with the threat of a repealed EV tax credit eating into adoption rates, that leaves plenty of time for brands to start filling up the market with their own cars, trucks, and other battery-powered people movers. In case you forgot, the Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevy Silverado EV and Tesla Cybertruck all exist, too. Again, each of these has some overlap with Rivian and Scout, but still cater to a specific customer.
So, at least for now, the segment seems harmonious. Both brands live in their own corners and are attracting their own customers, blissfully aware that the other exists and unfazed by the other's existence. But will the friendly competition last if either brand starts to grow and offer more ""normie"" versions of their cars for the mass market? Only time will tell.
It seems like the whole auto industry is holding its breath over the future of the $7,500 EV tax credit—everyone except for Lucid, that is. Lucid's attitude is apathetic at best, with CEO Peter Rawlinson throwing a big fat shrug at the unknown rather than sweating whether or not Lucid's future hinges on the incoming Trump administration doing away with the EV tax credit.
“Lucid, amongst all the EV makers, is really the most immune from that,” said Rawlinson in an interview with Bloomberg, referencing the possible revocation of the $7,500 EV tax credit.
See, Lucid is in a unique position: it doesn't need the credit. In fact, the only vehicle that it sells today—the $69,900-and-up Lucid Air—doesn't even qualify for it because the cheapest model starts above the $55,000 threshold for electric sedans. Lucid hasn't said whether or not its upcoming Gravity model (which technically starts within the $80,000 cut-off limit for SUVs) qualifies for the tax credit, but judging by Rawlinson's comment, it doesn't seem to matter:
Rawlinson believes that the tech in Lucid's vehicle, soon-to-be vehicles, speaks for itself and will help guide the automaker into the next phase of its Gravity-fed growth. The CEO feels that the EV startup has even surpassed Tesla in industry-leading efficiency, so having Elon Musk at the ear of the president-elect for favorable treatment seems to put very little fear in Lucid's business:
“We’ve really taken the mantle of technology leadership from Tesla right now, and this is not really sufficiently recognized,"" said Rawlinson. ""So, I think we’re in a very strong position to weather any such storm.”
These are bold words for a car company that is projected to sell just half of a percent (yes, 0.5%) of the number of cars compared to the company it claims to have stolen the tech crown from. Rawlinson seems to be convinced that people will be lining up to buy a Lucid because it's a Lucid, not because it happens to be the best deal out there because of a meager $7,500 discount.
But then again, if Rawlinson is right, it could finally be Lucid's time to shine amongst the luxury nameplates. The automaker still needs to overcome its currently unprofitable carmaking operation before all of its investor funds dry up (again), which is what it appears to be depending on the Gravity to help with. But the tax credit? Not so much.
Lotus has always been the brand that cares more about cornering than cupholders. The driver-centric approach was Lotus' niche, but with years of bleak sales amid other premium brands, the same technique would also almost be its coup de grace. Thankfully, Chinese automaker Geely extended a lifeline—one that would transform the brand into an all-electric lifestyle brand, or so we thought.
The British racing brand previously committed to electrifying its lineup by 2028, and it seemed on track to do exactly that as it introduced its Eletre SUV. But now, Lotus seems to be taking the same road as other brands and ripping up plans for an EV-only future. But rather than commit to a new ICE powertrain, Lotus is instead looking to the spectrum of hybridization in Geely's parts bins. Now, it could soon offer plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and extended-range EV (EREV) options.
“At Lotus, we have always chosen the best power technology available, whether it’s pure gasoline, pure electric, hybrid or range-extended [EV],” said Lotus CEO Feng Qingfeng in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, according to AutoCar.
Feng said that Lotus previously rejected plug-in hybrids because they were a compromise compared to pure EVs. While Lotus appears to have rethought this for future models, the brand isn't completely sold on only EVs or only PHEVs. Instead, it will also look to EREVs—that is, an EV with a combustion-powered generator to charge the battery like Scout's Harvester and Ram's Ramcharger—to complete its lineup.
It's hard not to ignore that this goes against just about everything Lotus stood for in its early racing days. I can't help but think of that line famously uttered by founder Colin Chapman: “simplify, then add lightness."" Maybe it's the purist in me, but this feels more like ""complicate, then add compromise."" But, then again, the purist-driven financials clearly aren't on Lotus' side.
So scoff at this direction if you must, but for Lotus, the move here is less about tradition and more about staying afloat in a market where Chinese smartphone makers can build 1,548-horsepower EVs that destroy Nurburgring records for breakfast. Stay tuned to see how this chapter for Lotus plays out in the long run.
New car buyers are quickly finding themselves with options that never existed before. EVs are starting to penetrate the market, and they offer pretty darn competitive in-class performance compared to gas-powered cars. Think: more seating area, more cargo space, better acceleration. It's a compelling argument if you're not worried about the slightly elevated cost or range anxiety.
I still find myself window-shopping gas cars and EVs constantly (impractically, if I'm being real with myself). And with limited options out there, it's easy to start crossing segments and comparing models that aren't even out yet. For example, the GR Corolla versus the upcoming Rivian R3X—one of them won't be on the streets for years and the other will surely undergo a refresh or be discontinued by the time it launches.
More realistic are the luxury and truck segments. For example, The Porsche Taycan versus the BMW 5-series, or the F-150 versus F-150 Lightning. A more practical example would be the Chevy Blazer EV and the Mazda CX-50.
There are plenty of options here, and I want to know which gas car you last cross-shopped with an EV. Let me know in the comments.",Rob Stumpf
The Mercedes CLA EV Will Have Both Tesla NACS And Type1 (J1772) Plugs (UPDATED),https://insideevs.com/news/741249/nacs-ccs-mercedes-cla-ev/,Both charging ports will be on the same side of the car under the same charging flap.,11/21/2024 10:49,"Correction and update: Mercedes-Benz officials initially told InsideEVs and other outlets that the upcoming CLA-Class would be equipped with both CCS1 and NACS fast-charging ports. The manufacturer has reached out to now clarify that this is incorrect.  It will, in fact, feature a Type1 (J1772) port for AC charging and a NACS port for DC fast charging. You will be able to fast-charge from a CCS1 station via a CCS1-to-NACS adapter. The original article follows below.
Most manufacturers selling electric vehicles in the U.S. have announced that they will begin switching from the typical Combined Charging System (CCS) plug to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug this year and next. Tesla's slimmer, sleeker plug type is expected to become the most common type of charger in the coming years, and adding access to the Tesla Supercharger network will be a godsend for American EV drivers everywhere. Mercedes will be the first German automaker to do so starting with the upcoming CLA-Class EV. But the Silver Arrow brand is doing something very novel and interesting here.
While in Germany at Mercedes’ Sindelfingen factory, InsideEVs learned that it will actually come with both NACS and CCS charging ports—a very unique proposition. If that’s not unusual enough, the two charging ports will be located on the right side of the car, stacked one on top of the other under the same charging port door.

Mercedes CLA Teaser (2025)
Mercedes recently published a set of teaser photos featuring a thinly veiled CLA prototype wearing revealing camouflage, which appeared to have flaps on both flanks. We thought it signaled the arrival of a plug-in hybrid variant. However, Mercedes confirmed that the vehicle in the teaser shots was the EV, which only had one charging port door on its right flank. It will only make the pure electric or non-plug-in hybrid CLA with a brand-new engine and hybrid system.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
Having the two most common types of charging ports will greatly improve the CLA’s versatility, giving owners the freedom to charge from Tesla Superchargers or any national public fast charging network natively without the need for an adapter. These adapters have sometimes proven problematic, and eliminating the need for one will result in a better user experience, which is what Mercedes is banking on with the CLA.
We saw plenty of camouflaged CLA prototypes driving around the Sindelfingen factory, and it looks like a bigger and more grown-up car than its predecessor. It’s also the first to be built on the 800-volt Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA), which will spawn three more models, including a shooting brake CLA and two crossovers (one of which will probably be a GLB-like seven-seater).
The high-voltage platform allows the CLA EV to charge at up to 320 kilowatts, enough to add 186 miles (300 kilometers) in 10 minutes with en-route preconditioning. It’s worth noting that even the latest V4 Tesla Supercharger is still officially limited to 250 kW of power (although Tesla wants to upgrade it to provide over 300 kW), so you will likely need a 350 kW CCS station to be able to match the official power claim.",Andrei Nedelea
"Zero’s 'Intelligent Aero' Takes From F1, But True Benefits Remain To Be Seen",https://www.rideapart.com/news/740983/zero-intelligent-aero-wmc-duct/,"It's definitely a step forward, but I'm beginning to question the direction.",12/25/2024 1:26,"I’m going to offer you an electric motorcycle, with a realistic 90-mile range for around 150% of the cost of a comparable ICE. What do you say? You don’t need to answer, sales figures and the general vibe of the motorcycle community have answered for you. Electric motorcycles are going until manufacturers address the cost and/or range issues, and Zero is, but not in the traditional way.
Zero Motorcycles collaborated with White Motorcycle Concepts (WMC), which is the company behind the British electric motorcycle land-speed world-record program, to incorporate WMC’s patented intelligent aerodynamic duct on a re-engineered Zero SR/S concept bike.
Although we don’t have any figures that’d indicate exactly how the duct would improve the SR/S’s performance figures, we know it’d result in a 10% reduction in aerodynamic drag.
WMC’s in-house engineering teams used processes and procedures learned whilst working on Formula 1 to help develop this proof of concept. But, just like in F1, the benefits of the aero duct don’t really come into play until the bike reaches higher speeds.
Aerodynamics is a hot topic, especially in MotoGP, where winglets and other devices improve lap times, though this efficiency benefit does not always translate to retail bikes. Our intelligent aero duct enhances aerodynamic efficiency, positively impacting upon power consumption, especially at high speeds.” said Robert White, Founder & CEO, of White Motorcycle Concepts.
So we get a 10% reduction in drag, but that’s only fully coming into play at higher speeds. Improved efficiency at highway speeds is a key area to focus on in the electric motorcycle world, as an electric bike’s range takes such a heavy blow at higher speeds that it makes using one untenable for plenty of people. But how much of a tangible improvement this technology will make to the SR/S’s range remains to be seen.
A step in the right direction, for sure, but not something to let you rest on your laurels. And that’s why one line from Zero’s press release made me somewhat concerned,
“The aerodynamic efficiency gain can be used to extend range or lower costs, reducing the need for a larger battery, which in turn cuts down on weight, charge time, and battery expenses.”
Unless Zero is about to pull a solid-state battery out of its behind, this technology won’t “reduce the need for a larger battery”. By all accounts, it seems like this intelligent aero system would make the bike marginally more efficient, meaning Zero would use a marginally smaller battery, so the savings to the customer would be, you guessed it, marginal.
Even if you can make electric motorcycles a bit cheaper, but for the majority of ICE riders who log serious miles, range will still keep electric bikes off the table. With that said, I have to imagine, regardless of what that line from the press release says, that Zero knows the biggest hurdle to electric motorcycle adoption lies in advancing battery technology so that price and range become a non-issue.
How much range would you need to consider replacing your ICE bike with an electric motorcycle? Let us know in the comments.

BMW Builds First Neue Klasse Pre-Production Prototypes In Hungary,https://insideevs.com/news/741832/neue-klasse-electric-suv-production/,The new plant in Debrecen will begin large-scale production of an iX3 replacement in 2025.,11/21/2024 8:46,"BMW is preparing to enter a new age of increasingly electrified vehicles, which is why it chose to resurrect the Neue Klasse moniker that originally designated a series of groundbreaking new models launched starting in 1962. Those models ended up defining BMW and shaping its image into what we know today, so the new Neue Klasse line, which will debut with an iX3 replacement in 2025, is seen as similarly pivotal for the company.
The automaker is erecting (or upgrading) factories around the world to build Neue Klasse vehicles, one of which is in Debrecen, Hungary. This brand-new plant has already started to build its first pre-production test vehicles, and it will soon begin to ramp up production, expecting to build the first customer vehicles in the latter part of next year.
But we don’t have to wait until then to see what the electric SUV codenamed NA5 will look like because its production body was fully revealed via leaked patent drawings. Autoweek published the images last week, and they show a vehicle that closely resembles the Vision Neue Klasse X, but it’s also considerably toned down and less aggressive.
Neue Klasse is the name of BMW’s new modular platform that will gradually phase out CLAR, the architecture used to underpin all the manufacturer's models from the 2 Series coupe to its largest offering, the X7. CLAR-based BMWs will remain in production until around the end of the decade, but the plan is for Neue Klasse to be used across the lineup.
We’re not completely sure Neue Klasse is an EV-only platform, though. BMW, like most other European automakers, has announced that it is pushing back the date when it goes pure-electric. BMW must have thought about at least making it possible to make range-extender EVs on the new platform, given that they seem to be rapidly growing in popularity. The company also has experience making EREVs after building the i3 Rex for several years.
More On This
Last year, BMW optimistically announced that it was going to achieve its goal of selling 50% EVs well before the self-imposed deadline of 2030. Now that seems unlikely, with EV sales not hitting predicted levels in most markets outside China, which is the only large market where electrification really seems to have taken off.
BMW is also investing $800 million to expand its plant in Mexico, which currently builds the CLAR-based 3 Series. The factory will begin building the same iX3-replacing electric SUV that just rolled off the production line in Hungary, but around two years later, in 2027. Additional Neue Klasse models will likely be produced in both factories in the next few years.
New generations of BMWs will also be built on the CLAR architecture, so the transition to Neue Klasse won’t be sudden. We’ve already seen spy photos of the next-generation combustion engine 3 Series codenamed G50, which will ride on an updated version of the platform that underpins the current model when it debuts around 2027. It will be sold alongside the pure-electric i3 previewed by the Vision Neue Klasse concept.",Andrei Nedelea
Honda Is Getting Closer To Making Solid-State Batteries,https://insideevs.com/news/741779/honda-solid-state-batteries-demonstration-facility/,"The automaker built a demonstration production line to figure out how to make affordable, high-density solid-state batteries for EVs and everything else.",11/21/2024 3:51,"All-solid-state batteries promise more driving range, faster charging speeds and potentially lower costs. They have been promised by battery manufacturers and automakers alike for at least a decade, but as it stands today, you still can’t walk into a showroom that sells electric vehicles and buy a car with a solid-state battery.
Small runs of prototype cells are already rolling off production lines across the world, but mass production is where things get complicated. That said, technology is moving at breakneck speed and several companies are promising we’ll be able to buy and drive an EV with solid-state batteries by the decade’s end.
One of those companies is Honda. The maker of the Prologue–which, admittedly, is made by General Motors–has built a life-size factory to demonstrate how it can manufacture all-solid-state batteries.
More Solid-State Battery Stories
With a floor area of nearly 300,000 square feet, the demo line is located on Honda’s property in Sakura City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. It has all the equipment needed to start the verification phase of each production process in preparation for the big leap.
That will happen sooner rather than later, which is excellent news. Honda says it will begin making actual batteries on this demo line in January 2025. However, these won’t make it into any EV; instead, these will be used to figure out what needs fixing before moving on to full-scale manufacturing in the following years.
Honda claims its first all-solid-state EVs will hit the market in the second half of the 2020s–that’s just one to four years away. The Japanese automaker’s might coincide with Stellantis’ plan to launch a demonstration fleet of Dodge Charger EVs with Factorial’s semi-solid-state batteries by 2026. Other companies like QuantumScape, Nissan and even Toyota are also working hard to bring solid-state batteries to mass production.
Honda’s approach to the potentially groundbreaking battery tech is to use conventional production processes that were originally designed for liquid lithium-ion batteries. However, the automaker’s research and development team adopted a roll-pressing technique which will help to achieve denser solid electrolyte layers. It also enables Honda to deploy continuous pressing rather than making solid electrolytes in smaller batches.
""The all-solid-state battery is an innovative technology that will be a game changer in this EV era,” said  Keiji Otsu, President and Representative Director of Honda R&D. “Replacing engines that have been supporting the advancements of automobiles to date, batteries will be the key factor of electrification. We believe that [the] advancement of batteries will be a driving force in the transformation of Honda. Now, the start of operation of our demonstration production line for our all-solid-state batteries is in sight, and we can say that we have reached an important milestone for Honda and the country of Japan.""
Honda’s EV plans in the United States have already started with GM’s help, and the Prologue is doing quite well here, but the long game includes several self-developed models part of a new line known as the Honda 0 Series. At least two new EVs will hit the streets starting in 2026, including an angular flagship sedan that was previewed by the rather lovely 0 Series Saloon Concept.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 9 Will Come With Tesla's NACS Plug,https://insideevs.com/news/741737/hyundai-ioniq-9-tesla-nacs/,"The three-row EV will work with Tesla Superchargers right out of the gate, with no adapter required.",11/20/2024 20:15,"Say hello to dongle-free Tesla Supercharging. The upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 9, revealed on Wednesday, will come from the factory with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug.
That means Ioniq 9 drivers will be able to visit Tesla's abundant and acclaimed charging stations without the need for a pesky adapter. The vast majority of other non-Tesla EVs, even ones that can technically access Superchargers now, use the Combined Charging System (CCS), which is quickly becoming the antiquated standard.
Owners of those EVs need to a CCS-to-NACS adapter if they want to charge at the thousands of Tesla Superchargers that blanket the country.
The Tesla NACS Transition
All major automakers have announced they're switching over to NACS and getting Supercharger access in return. Historically, only Teslas could access Superchargers, and that was a huge selling point for the brand. Tesla spent years building out the largest and, by many accounts, the most reliable and easy to use EV charging network.
Now other companies have inked deals to grant their EVs access to that walled garden. But those plans are moving slower than expected, and not every firm is at the same stage in the process. Ford, Rivian,  General Motors, Hyundai, Volvo and Polestar all have access to the network now. But so far, that's only been possible using adapters. Hyundai's 2025 Ioniq 5 crossover is the first non-Tesla EV to go on sale with a built-in NACS port, and it will hit dealerships later this year.
The Ioniq 9, a three-row bigger brother to the 5, will go on sale next spring. Of course, native NACS is a double-edged sword, given that the industry is still very much in-between standards. Owners may still have to use a dongle to plug in at non-Tesla stations.

Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles Of Range And A Tesla Plug,https://insideevs.com/news/741714/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row/,"We tour the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the latest entry into the growing world of electric family-haulers—and maybe the most enticing one yet.",11/20/2024 20:00,"If you’ve been hunting for an electric three-row SUV but never loved any of the choices available, you’re not alone. The Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X have their compromises, and while we love the Kia EV9, some variety would be nice too.
The situation is improving, thanks again to the Hyundai Motor Group. Following the home run it scored with the EV9, the Hyundai Ioniq 9 makes its debut as the newest and largest addition to its acclaimed Ioniq family of EVs.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
The Ioniq 9 builds on what makes its smaller siblings great: long ranges, fast charging and head-turning design. It’s just all in a bigger package that, for better or worse, American families increasingly crave.
And it's more than just a re-badged and re-bodied EV9 this time. It beats the EV9 on range and even comes with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug right out of the gate, so it'll be ready to use the thousands of Supercharger stations out there on the next family road trip.
First came the Ioniq 5 as a compact crossover aimed at the Tesla Model Y. Then Hyundai launched the Ioniq 6, a streamlined sedan with epic efficiency and range. Hyundai’s third U.S.-market EV on its modern E-GMP platform is the Ioniq 9. It offers up to seven seats and is an electric alternative to the Hyundai Palisade.
It’s part of Hyundai’s plan to have a lineup of 23 electric models by 2030. It goes into production this coming spring at Hyundai’s Georgia plant, so the automaker expects it to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, which requires vehicles to be assembled in North America. (That is, if that policy still exists when the vehicle goes on sale.)
Hyundai hasn’t announced pricing yet, only saying it will be “competitive.” Given that the EV9 starts at around $55,000, somewhere around there is probably a good guess. It’ll cost a lot more than a Palisade or Santa Fe, I can tell you that much.
Hyundai is targeting an Environmental Protection Agency range rating of up to 335 miles, which is well above average and sure to dampen some buyers’ range anxiety. Even more impressively, the brand says that no matter what Ioniq 9 trim you buy, it’ll be rated for at least 300 miles. The same can’t be said of its cousin, the EV9, which is good for anywhere from 230 to 304 miles, depending on the trim.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Much of that has to do with the Ioniq 9’s 110.3 kilowatt-hour, nickel-cobalt-manganese battery, which is about 10% larger than the largest pack available in the EV9. Long range and super-fast charging is a winning combination, and that’s just what the Ioniq 9 serves up. Hyundai says the 9 will be able to recharge from 10%-80% in 24 minutes on a sufficiently powerful plug, thanks to its 800-volt architecture. And it comes from the factory with Tesla’s NACS plug design. So owners will be able to plug in at some 17,000 Tesla Superchargers without needing to use an adapter.
The NACS Rollout
Every major automaker is switching over to NACS from the Combined Charging System, the current standard, but Hyundai is ahead of the curve. Other automakers are still putting out new or updated models with the old charging port, necessitating the use of a dongle at Superchargers.
There will be three powertrain options on offer. The Long-Range RWD is the range champion, while the Performance AWD is the quickest. The AWD Long Range fits in the middle.
Here’s how they break down:
At first glance, the Ioniq 9 gives off minivan vibes. I mean this in a good way; the 9 lacks the standard upright boxiness of other big SUVs and that gives it a striking presence. Its short hood, steep windshield and curving roofline give it a sleek, unique look. Just like on other Ioniq models, the exterior is dotted with hundreds of little squares, or “pixels,” that tie together the otherwise disparate-looking EVs.
And a stretched-out wheelbase—the longest of any Hyundai model—creates plenty of room to stretch out inside. Of course, as a three-row SUV, the Ioniq 9’s main selling point is how much stuff and people you can fit inside.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
The Ioniq 9’s cabin does indeed feel huge, as I learned when I got a preview of the model earlier this month. It has a flat floor throughout, which frees up room for your feet, particularly in the middle seat. The second row is downright cavernous and can be optioned with either a three-seat bench or reclining captain’s chairs. The third row is totally usable, even for adults. When I crawled back there, I didn’t feel cramped in the legroom or headroom departments.
The Kia EV9
One fun touch up front is the addition of a sliding center console. So when you want extra room between the front seats for a purse or something, you can slide the unit backward. When you need more room in the rear, you can shift it forward. A similar feature is also available in the Ioniq 5.
Up front, the 9 offers high-output, 100-watt USB-C ports that get their power straight from the high-voltage battery. That’s in addition to vehicle-to-load, or V2L, a feature that lets owners use the Ioniq 9 as a mobile battery pack to power practically anything.
The Ioniq 9 has the same dual-screen setup that’s shared with other Kia and Hyundai EVs. In this one, though, it’s curved rather than flat, which is a nice touch. Both the driver-facing cluster and the main screen come in at 12 inches. And the system can handle over-the-air software updates, just like previous models.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
What’s new here is something called “Features on Demand,” an in-vehicle store where owners can buy “digital upgrades” for their cars. It’s debuting with a few options: some lighting signatures for opening or closing the doors, new themes for the displays, and streaming services like Amazon Music and Soundcloud.
Don’t worry—Hyundai says paying to activate one's heated seats is off the table.
2024 Kia EV9
We won’t know for sure until we can get the Ioniq 9 out on the road and spend some quality time with it. But it’s mostly a question of design preference. These two SUVs share a platform, they’re both big and spacious, and their user interfaces will feel similar too. The Ioniq 9 has the firm edge on range, though, which may be the deciding factor for some folks. And we know that the EV9 will soon pack the NACS port as well, along with an adapter for the existing cars.
At the end of the day, it’s just great to see another solid electric option for bigger families.

Jaguar Follows Up Controversial Ad With Controversial EV,https://insideevs.com/news/741742/jaguar-preview-new-ev-miami/,Jaguar's new EV is as avant-garde as its controversial rebranding and ad campaign. But all that hate may be misplaced.,11/20/2024 16:24,"It seems like the fruits of Jaguar’s new rebrand may just pay off.
Hot on the heels of a controversial advertisement and announcement of new logos and typeface, the storied British sports car and sedan brand has shown off a cryptic look at its first model in an EV future, with an announcement that we’ll soon learn more on Dec. 2 in Miami.
The teaser doesn’t show a lot, but we can ascertain a surprisingly high amount of information from what appears to be a cropped dead-on rear photo of an aqua-colored car against a bright pink background. The mystery Jaguar is very wide, appearing to have a sports car-like width that houses the car’s wide tires. The car’s lines are interestingly rectilinear, a dramatic change from the organic flowing shapes of Jaguar’s now-discontinued ICE and EV models.
What few curves there are in the car’s haunches are offset by the car’s straight line and simplistic cutouts for what could be a rear grille or rear window. Whatever the case, it’s certainly a huge departure from whatever Jaguar was doing before today.
Jaguar Commercial Screenshot
For those not in the know, Jaguar just previewed a provocative new advertising campaign that signaled a relaunch and rebranding of the classic British brand. It featured a high-contrast color palette, along with young high-fashion models in androgynous garments that feel reminiscent of designs from the late, great Alexander McQueen. The advertisement didn’t show a car or a timeline—just a tagline that said “copy nothing,"" which is actually a callback to a famous saying from Jaguar's founder.
The campaign felt as if Jaguar had somehow become a fashion brand under LVMH selling skincare or handbags rather than cars.
The ad’s reception has been pretty controversial. Some have praised Jaguar for taking a chance and attempting to set itself apart in a premium EV world, while others think the company should have focused on introducing a car—especially since Jaguar is killing its entire lineup of vehicles (including its lone EV) until its new models are introduced.
But the ad's inclusion of diverse faces and bodies has put Jaguar right in the crosshairs of the culture wars. Fox News called it ""Bud Light 2.0"" On X, the social media network owned by Elon Musk with an algorithm now keenly dialed in to reflect his politics, some have insisted that Jaguar’s ad is a symptom of everything wrong with society, that the mere presence of models in dresses means that Jaguar is done for.
Those seem like strange critiques to anyone who has paid any attention to the fashion industry. Jaguar's new direction feels pretty much in line with any luxury fashion house marketing campaign from any point in time from 2021 onward. That's clearly the vibe Jaguar is going for now, and probably must, since the cars are slated to cost at least $120,000.
A lot of the hate comments tend to revolve around a bygone era of Jaguar, one that they think catered to ""rich men"" intrested in the old-style, stodgy designs like the pre-2010 Jaguar XJ. But those designs, that marketing—it just wasn't working. In 2023, Jaguar sold a whopping 8,438 cars. By comparison, Genesis sold 68,798 vehicles that same year. Clearly, Jaguar was in bad need of a shake-up.
Whatever you feel, you can’t deny that it certainly got people talking about Jaguar in ways that its old cars never, ever did. Searches for Jaguar are up dramatically since it pulled this marketing stunt. Maybe Jaguar knows something we don’t, and it’ll pay off in the long run.
Jaguar’s next vehicle, which is likely a concept car, will be unveiled in early December. Is Jaguar's new direction misguided? Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

Zeekr 7x Crossover Spotted Testing In Europe Before Debut,https://insideevs.com/news/741726/zeekr-7x-europe-china-testing/,This BMW X3-sized EV will likely end up on European roads before the end of next year.,11/20/2024 16:00,"Geely, Zeekr, the EU, and China are all hot-button topics right now, as each entity goes through its own tumultuous re-organization to protect its own interests. Geely has merged Zeekr and Lynk & Co back into one entity (sort of), while the EU demands a technology transfer from China if it wants to establish more European roots. Nevertheless, the wheels of progress keep turning, right? The Sino-Swedish brand Zeekr is continuing its quest for growth in markets outside of China by growing its model lineup. According to new photos, the 7x luxury compact crossover is next on the docket for European expansion.
Photographed in the midst of validation testing, this all-black crossover looks pretty much identical to the version already on sale in China. There are a few differences. For example, the wheels on this test unit are different from the ones found on the Zeekr 7x on Chinese roads. Also, this unit appears to be missing the customizable light-up Stargate panel that we’ve seen on the Zeekr 007. To be fair, it is optional on Chinese models.
Remember, the Zeekr 7x uses the same SEA platform that’s underpinning a plethora of new EVs made by Geely and its associated brands. This means the 7x effectively is a mechanical sibling to the Polestar 4, Zeekr 001, Zeekr 007, and a gaggle of new Smart-branded EVs that thus far only exist in Europe and China.
However, it appears that the 7x tends to favor the 007 out of all of them. Upon launch, the 7x got the same 800-volt architecture as the 007, unlike the older 400-volt architecture that underpins the Polestar 4 and export versions of the Zeekr 001. When coupled with Zeekr’s 75 kWh Golden Battery, the brand claims it can sprint from 10-80% in under 11 minutes.
Now, there’s no news as to what changes the 7x will have before it enters the European market. But, if it does keep the 800-volt architecture and 75 kWh LFP battery, the 7x could end up being one of the fastest-charging vehicles on sale in Europe.
Of course, we don’t know what price the 7x will take. In China, the 7x significantly undercuts EV crossovers from brands like BMW, which costs only about $31,000 for a base single-motor 7x. However, imported Zeekrs are subject to an additional 19.9% tariff (not including the 10% already added in), which naturally will raise the price. Also, it’s not uncommon for Chinese manufacturers to raise the price for export markets. The Zeekr X (mechanical twin to the Volvo EX30) starts at about $45,000 USD, significantly more than the roughly $23,000 an equivalent version would cost in China. The 7x is likely to be somewhat more expensive than the subcompact Zeekr X.
The Zeekr 7x will likely go on sale in Europe before the end of next year.

"2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 Gets Tesla NACS Port Up Front, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741700/2026-genesis-electrified-gv70/,"The charging port is located at the front of the SUV, just like before, but now it’s motorized and heated.",11/20/2024 15:00,"The Genesis Electrified GV70 doesn't get as much attention as some of the Hyundai Motor Group's other electric models, but it's always impressed us with its combination of style, performance and comfort. Now, a lot more people might notice it soon, as it's found at Tesla Supercharger stations.
This is the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. It’s not a completely new model but rather a subtle facelift that also brings a couple of notable changes under the skin. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a native NACS charging port at the front of the EV. The location of the port isn’t new–the outgoing model’s CCS1 port was also at the front–but the native NACS is new and makes the Electrified GV70 the first EV in the Genesis lineup to come with one from the factory.
2026 Genesis GV70 Electrified Tesla NACS
As a reminder, NACS means North American Charging Standard. It’s Tesla’s invention and it means the 2026 Electrified GV70 will be able to recharge at Tesla Superchargers in North America without using a charging adapter. However, Genesis said customers will get an NACS to CCS adapter to top up their EVs at CCS DC fast chargers. Combined, there are over 36,000 NACS and CCS DC fast chargers in the United States, so going on long road trips shouldn’t be a daunting experience anymore.
More Genesis Stuff (Not The Band)
Besides switching from CCS to NACS, Genesis added a motor to the charging port door (it previously used a manual release), as well as a heating element to the charging port to help with de-icing during cold months. There’s also new lighting to make it easier to see what you’re doing while parked in dark places.
The second notable change is a bigger battery under the floor. The outgoing model had a 77.4-kilowatt-hour pack that enabled an EPA-estimated range of 236 miles on a full charge. The 2026 model comes with a larger 84 kWh battery that should provide a longer driving range, but there’s no official rating yet. Power remains unchanged, with a dual-motor setup good for 429 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.
Several design changes have been made, including a redesigned G-Matrix Crest Grille and multi-lens array (MLA) headlamps. There’s also a refreshed skid plate design and new 19- and 21-inch wheels. Inside, there’s an all-new 27-inch OLED display that integrates both the instrument cluster and infotainment.
The facelifted Electrified GV70 now responds quicker and better to voice commands, according to the Korean automaker. There are also improved over-the-air update capabilities, but we don’t know what that means, exactly.
The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 is manufactured in South Korea but Hyundai Motor Group’s plant in Alabama is responsible for the final assembly. Genesis says the EV is “dual-sourced at the brand’s production facilities in Montgomery, Alabama and Ulsan, Korea.”
The refreshed all-electric SUV will arrive at North American retailers in the first half of 2025. Pricing details are yet to be determined, but we’ll know more when Genesis starts taking orders next year. The current model starts at $68,300 including destination. We expect the refreshed model to be similar in price.",Iulian Dnistran
The Audi Q8 E-Tron Will Be Axed Early And Its Factory Will Close,https://insideevs.com/news/741718/audi-brussels-factory-close-february/,"China’s Nio was reportedly interested in acquiring the Audi Brussels factory, but the deal was never confirmed.",11/20/2024 14:00,"We’ve known for months about the troubles Audi has been having with its Brussels plant that today only builds the Q8 E-Tron. Rumors that the automaker was considering ending production of the electric SUV early, essentially stopping all work at the facility. This made its 3,000 workers uneasy, and many gathered outside in protest, even setting tires alight to attract attention and make the extent of their worries clear.
Angry protesters reportedly broke into the facility last Wednesday and tried to enter the meeting room where union representatives were in talks with factory officials regarding its future. The police were called to remove the protester and try and instill calm, but it apparently degenerated into violence, according to EuroNews.
More On This
Audi tried to find a buyer for the factory, and China’s Nio, which Audi had a naming dispute with in the past, was reportedly interested in taking it over, but that deal was never confirmed by either party, and nothing materialized. Now Automotive News says Audi has officially ended the search for a buyer, which likely means the plant will shut its doors in a few months.
That will probably happen when production of the Q8 E-Tron, which hasn’t been as big a hit as Audi was hoping, stops at the end of February next year. The reasons behind the Q8 E-Tron’s failure are complex and are a mix of falling EV demand in key markets, the arrival of increasingly talented rivals from China, and the fact that it’s just a revamp of the original Audi E-Tron SUV launched in 2018, which feels like an eternity ago given the rate of progress of EVs globally.
The Brussels plant could be Volkswagen’s first factory to shut its doors, but two more could follow, along with tens of thousands of job cuts across Europe and a 10% salary cut for the employees that will stay. This is from another EuroNews report that quoted Volkswagen’s General Works Council Chairwoman Daniela Cavallo as saying, ""All German VW plants are affected by this. None of them are safe.""
Audi parent Volkswagen says it was not expecting post-pandemic demand to be so weak, and it was caught with too much production capacity. Reuters says strikes are expected at all of VW’s European plants starting next month and it all depends on what deals the unions will be able to negotiate with the automaker.
The workers’ union is proposing that no factories close but they are willing to accept concessions like forgoing bonuses in 2025 and 2026 that could yield €1.5 ($1.58) billion in savings, and it says it plans to take the automaker to court if it proceeds with the planned plant closures. This means there is still a chance Volkswagen (and Audi) will keep its overproducing factories open, but it will definitely close them if this poses a threat to its very existence (which isn’t the case yet since its finances aren't in the red).",Andrei Nedelea
Electric Mini Cooper And Aceman U.S. Launch Is Up In The Air,https://insideevs.com/news/741709/mini-cooper-se-aceman-delayed/,"The new electric Mini hatch and the high-riding Aceman were slated to arrive in the U.S. in 2026, but now that may not happen at all.",11/20/2024 13:00,"The high import tariff on electric vehicles made in China, which in the U.S. is now up to 100%, has made many manufacturers reconsider their strategy and reassess their plans to expand their lineups. Mini, for instance, decided against importing the new electric Cooper hatchback, which is currently exclusively made in China, saying that it would bring it over once parallel production started in the U.K. at Mini’s Oxford plant.
This pushed the Stateside launch of the Cooper EV back by two years, but according to a new report published by Road&Track with information from Motoring File, that plan may have fallen through. The same goes for the Aceman, which is the Cooper’s crossover equivalent, that’s also built in the same Great Wall Motor factory in China and whose U.S. debut was also planned for 2026.
The launch of the Cooper and Aceman EVs has now been put on hold until further notice, and it may not happen at all. Mini is still going to import the Countryman EV into North America, but there’s a chance that could be its only electric model. It will continue to offer the gas-burning Cooper hatch and convertible, both of which are manufactured in Oxford and aren’t subject to import duties, although that might change under the presidency of Donald Trump, which may impose a 10% tariff on imports from Europe.
The 100% tariff is also the main reason why Volvo delayed launching the China-made EX30 in the States. It’s now expected to arrive in the States next year once production begins at Volvo’s plant in Belgium.
More Mini EV Stories
We’ve already tried the China-made 2024 Cooper SE in Europe and had a lot of things to say about it. Considering it’s underpinned by the same platform as the Ora Cat (albeit with a superior independent rear suspension setup), it felt great, although not as fun as the previous Cooper SE. It has much bigger batteries, though, so it has a lot more range, making it a much more usable EV and expanding its breadth of talents.
Considering EV buyers seem to be increasingly looking at high-riding crossovers rather than the traditional hatchback, sedan and wagon body styles, perhaps the new electric Countryman is the only EV that Mini really needs in its U.S. lineup. When we sampled the Countryman SE at its launch event in Portugal in March, we found a lot to like, and we thought the EV variant was a better choice than any of the versions that still use fuel.",Andrei Nedelea
"Tavares: China Is 'Many Years' Ahead With EVs, Says EU Politicians Created 'Dead End'",https://www.motor1.com/news/744740/tavares-resignation-amicable-blames-eu-politicians/,"The Ex-Stellantis CEO believes China is years ahead when it comes to EVs, hence his push for company goals many said were unrealistic.",12/25/2024 7:27,"Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares isn't backing down from the decisions that led to his resignation. In his first interview since voluntarily exiting the company, he effectively double-downed on his stance that conflicted with the Stellantis board members. At the same time, he voiced concerns that China was far ahead in the electric fold, essentially forcing European brands into survival mode.
Speaking with Portuguese news outlet Expresso, the ex-executive emphasized the importance of having a strong, singular vision and admitted his plan didn't mesh with the board.
""A company that has 250,000 employees and 15 brands cannot be managed with a lack of alignment,” said Tavares, according to Expresso. That was the catalyst for his resignation, which Tavares described as an ""amicable"" joint decision between him and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. And it seems he has no regrets, as Wards Auto reports he would make the same calls if it all came about again.
His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",12/25/2024 7:27,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,12/25/2024 7:27,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",12/25/2024 7:27,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

Volkswagen's New American CEO Comes From Rivian,https://insideevs.com/news/741708/vw-rivian-laas-cm-2024/,"Plus, the Hyundai Motor Group's EVs plan to own the LA Auto Show, while Ford makes cuts in Europe.",11/20/2024 10:39,"The Rivian-Volkswagen $6 billion joint venture got a little more interesting this week. The Volkswagen Group of America, which includes the core VW marques plus Audi, Lamborghini and other brands, is getting a new CEO whose last stint was at the California-based electric vehicle startup. And it's a homecoming of sorts as well, since new CEO Kjell Gruner also ran Porsche Cars North America for a few years. Can he help turn around an iconic brand whose American future feels a bit murky these days?
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news from the mobility and technology spaces. Also on tap for today: we look at Hyundai Motor Group's big electric plans for the LA Auto Show, while Ford is cutting jobs in Europe.
VW NA CEO Kjell Gruner
Even I'll admit that the ""new CEO from Rivian"" in my headline is a bit of a reach here. Yes, Gruner is a former Rivian executive. But he was only the startup's sales chief for 11 months between 2023 and earlier this summer. Gruner is a 25-year auto industry veteran who worked as a manager at Porsche in Germany, what was then called DaimlerChrysler, then Mercedes-Benz, then back to various leadership roles at Porsche until he was CEO of its North American operations.
Gruner's appointment to the top job was announced yesterday alongside the departure of Pablo Di Si, who VW officials said ""stepped down from his position last week on his own request."" Di Si had been CEO of the division for about two years.
So why the change? It's hard to point to one particular reason, but across the board, the global VW Group is generally not in fantastic shape. It's getting creamed in China by new, local competitors, losing ground in Europe to them too, struggling with a shrinking overall car market, and probably has a war brewing with its labor unions as it seeks unprecedented plant closures. In the U.S., it's doing a little better; Automotive News reports sales were up 19% in Q3, but on the backs of heavy discounts, which is never great for the bottom line. And VW's once-ambitious electric transition feels more endangered than ever. After years of hype, in the U.S. it just sells the ID.4 and now the ID.Buzz—the former's sales haven't been great as of late and the latter is on the expensive side for the range it offers.
Volkswagen, as a brand and as a conglomerate, seems to be in the midst of figuring out what it really is in 2024 and beyond. Perhaps Gruner will be able to help figure that out, at least on our shores.
Hyundai Ioniq 9 teaser
One automaker that does seem to have things figured out is Hyundai. Its leaders have repeatedly insisted that it's not slowing down on the EV front as many rivals are, and that it can capitalize on its huge U.S. investments. But that theory is about to get tested if the EV tax credits evaporate.
We'll see a lot of that at this week's LA Auto Show, which like most big auto shows has been inconsistent in terms of new product news in recent years. But Hyundai and its brands are the ostensible stars this time: we expect to see the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the U.S.-spec 2026 Kia EV6, the public debut of the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, some news from Genesis and more. Plus, all of the cars debuting here should have the Tesla NACS plug and almost all—if not all—may end up being built in the U.S. too.
Expect more on these debuts as we get them.
Ford Explorer EV production start in Cologne, Germany
But again, not everyone is having a great time in this space. Ford is cutting jobs in Europe as its Capri and Explorer EV models, which are based on a VW Group electric platform, seemingly fail to take off. Here's Agence France-Presse:
""The company has incurred significant losses in recent years,"" Ford said in a statement, blaming ""the industry shift to electrified vehicles and new competition."" The move will affect 2,900 jobs in Germany, 800 in the UK and 300 in western Europe by the end of 2027, a Ford spokesman told AFP.
""It is critical to take difficult but decisive action to ensure Ford's future competitiveness in Europe,"" said Dave Johnston, Ford's European vice-president in the statement.
The company also said it was adjusting the production of its Explorer and Capri models, resulting in reduced hours at its Cologne plant in the first quarter of 2025.
Europe's entire car market just isn't in a great way right now.
2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz U.S. edition first drive.
What's your advice to Gruner as he steps into the top job? How does VW's American arm—now more important than ever, with China sales shrinking—kick things into high gear?

Make No Mistake: Killing The EV Tax Credit Hurts Tesla Too,https://insideevs.com/news/741135/tesla-ev-tax-credit-end/,"Suddenly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he's anti-subsidies. He may want to double-check his own balance sheet.",11/15/2024 10:00,"When former President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to end the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, many people pointed to his newfound close ties with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as proof that he wouldn't really act to deliberately harm America's nascent EV sector.
But as with all things Musk, it's not that simple. It never is.
Yesterday, Trump's transition team made headlines when sources told Reuters that it was already formulating plans to kill the credit, and that Tesla representatives told the team they supported the move. In other words, America's largest EV maker favors ending a subsidy that has helped drive millions of its sales so far. (Tesla no longer responds to requests for comment from news outlets.)
It's a baffling argument to make. The U.S. auto industry and related companies like battery manufacturers are investing some $300 billion into EV production aimed at giving America the tools to compete with a rising China, which also heavily subsidized that transition.
But the going theory is that Tesla is the only American automaker (and really, the only Western one) that is profitable and manufacturing at scale with EVs, so ending the tax credits would hurt competitors taking up Tesla's market share like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai and others. Musk has been saying this for a while; on his social media platform X in recent months, he called for an ""end [to] all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas."" And on a July earnings call, he said ending the credit would be ""devastating for our competitors"" but ""long term probably actually helps Tesla.""
That may depend on the length of the ""term"" Musk is talking about these days. Unless you have complete and total blind faith that his five-dimensional chess game will prevail in the end, this is not good news for Tesla, and its ostensible CEO may want to look at his own balance sheet before he pushes for this.
Tesla EVs
There's no getting around the fact that ending tax credits will hurt the entire EV sector. It's why the U.S. auto industry's top lobbying group is so opposed to the move, urging Congressional Republicans to keep this momentum going or risk losing out to China. Granted, Tesla has always been an outlier in that space, even more so than other startups like Rivian and Lucid; Musk has long leaned into the idea that it's a ""tech company"" rather than an automaker, which is what drives its sky-high valuation.
Yet as countless critics have pointed out, Tesla has long depended on subsidies of all kinds. (So have Musk's other companies, including lucrative government contracts.) The EV and hybrid tax credit actually dates back to the George W. Bush administration. Save for a few years in the late first Trump era and the start of President Joe Biden's before the Inflation Reduction Act kicked in—when automakers would lose the original credit after selling a certain number of cars—Tesla has almost always benefitted from those credits in some way.
While Tesla's U.S. sales have been dipping due to increased competition, the potential backlash to Musk's online presence and politics and its aging lineup (more on that in a moment), it has benefitted tremendously from the IRA too. Though Tesla also implemented intense price cuts in 2023, those tax credits still helped propel it to more than 650,000 sales in 2023—a 25% jump from the previous year. And even though not every current Tesla model qualifies due to where some of their batteries are made, this certainly does help move metal.
Other kinds of subsidies help just as much. It's unclear which ones Musk really wants removed, but Tesla has racked up billions of dollars over the years in regulatory credits: essentially, other manufacturers buy credits from Tesla because they themselves cannot meet strict emissions targets. It's represented almost $2 billion in revenue in each of the past two years. Does Musk want to get rid of the system that creates that situation too? It's unclear.
That doesn't sound like a lot for an automaker that pulled in $96 billion in revenue these past two years, but between that and the hit to sales, it does add up. So does the fact that Tesla once banked on being a key charging driver for the rest of the auto industry. Every U.S. EV maker switched to its plug type and got, or is working on, a deal to access its Tesla Supercharger network. One analyst I spoke to said that was pegged to add up to an additional $20 billion for Tesla by 2030.
If the EV tax credit dies and electric sales from other automakers fall, you can add that revenue to the tally as well.
Tesla Cybercab Robotaxi
If you were to ask Musk in one word the real reason he's doing this, my guess is it would be ""robotaxis.""
This era of Tesla is betting the farm not on electric cars or competing with China, but on the idea that one day it will crack the code of fully autonomous driving. In theory, then everybody will want to move to its cars en masse because driving yourself will be as outdated as owning a horse. (Indeed, that's a big part of why Tesla implemented so many price cuts in 2023: get as many people into its cars as possible and then charge for Full Self-Driving subscriptions.)
But if that's the plan, it must be where Musk means ""long-term."" Autopilot and FSD have gotten better in recent years but they're nowhere near ready for truly autonomous, steering-wheel-free driving. Google's Waymo robotaxi service has logged more than 25 million miles of human-free driving so far; Tesla has logged essentially none. Even in the consumer car space, there are technologies that automate driving assistance better than Tesla can in many scenarios since the automaker is wholly dependent on AI and cameras instead of advanced sensor suites.
Now that he's close with Trump, Musk is also banking on being able to tear through regulations that he feels are holding autonomous vehicles back while setting new ones to drive their growth. But again, that's a long-game strategy at best that isn't validated by anything we've seen so far from Tesla's actual technology. And the company still has to sell cars in the meantime to bankroll that dream.
Tesla Model Y
This is where things really start to fall down for Tesla: its family of cars is getting old. The world's best-selling car in 2023, the Model Y, is quickly losing ground to new competitors in terms of specs and performance. Other automakers are quickly expanding into electric spaces that Tesla is ignoring, like three-row SUVs and affordable compact cars. Musk even recently said he sees no point in making a ""regular"" $25,000 EV that isn't fully autonomous because it wouldn't be investing in the future; ""it would be completely at odds with what we believe,"" he said on a recent earnings call. And there are many signs that Cybertruck demand is slipping as well.
Tesla is expected to release an updated ""Juniper"" Model Y next year, and there's little doubt that will juice EV sales. But with Musk increasingly bored with making cars, and very few new models on the horizon, and an industry and driving populace just not ready for full autonomy yet, where does Musk expect growth to come from? Perhaps the plan for Tesla is to kneecap its EV competitors, coast with modestly updated versions of its current cars, live without regulatory credits and then wait however long it takes to become a robotaxi company—all while hoping the fallout from Musk's own antics don't completely tank its own sales.
If that's really the case, we should all get comfortable. We're going to be here for a while.
In the meantime, it's hard to see who really wins from killing the tax credits besides the oil industry and China. It certainly won't be this country's largest electric automaker.

‘He Doesn’t Know How To Make A Battery’: China’s CATL Chief Blasts Elon Musk,https://insideevs.com/news/740941/he-doesnt-know-how-to-make-battery-musk-blasted-catl-chief/,"CATL is the largest battery manufacturer in the world. Its founder and chairman, Robin Zeng, disagrees with Musk on several topics.",11/14/2024 3:56,"Tesla placed a big bet back in 2020 when it announced that it was developing a new battery cell format. The 4680 battery, as it’s known, powers the Cybertruck and in the past, it made its way into a limited number of Model Y crossovers.
The cylindrical cell was touted as being more energy-dense than the 2170- and 1865-type units found in the Model Y and Model 3 and the Model S and Model X, respectively. It’s also supposed to be cheaper to manufacture and easier to assemble.
Recently, Tesla announced that it produced its 100 millionth 4680 cell. That’s a big achievement and a sign that the company managed to ramp up production of the proprietary cell significantly to reach an average manufacturing rate of 495,000 cells per day. That’s enough for 368 Cybertrucks.
More Battery Stuff
However, the biggest battery maker in the world, Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited, better known as CATL, believes that going down the cylindrical cell route is a dead end. CATL’s founder and head honcho, Robin Zeng, told Tesla CEO Elon Musk this to his face. The reaction was silence.
Zang, who spoke with Reuters, said he had told Tesla’s head honcho that his bet on the 4680 cylindrical battery “is going to fail and never be successful.”
""We had a very big debate, and I showed him,"" Zeng said. ""He was silent. He doesn't know how to make a battery. It's about electrochemistry. He's good for the chips, the software, the hardware, the mechanical things.""
But that’s not all. Zang also had some remarks about Musk’s tendency to set unrealistic timelines for upcoming products. ""His problem is overpromising. I talked to him,"" Zeng said. ""Maybe something needs five years. But he says two years. I definitely asked him why. He told me he wanted to push people.""
Tesla 4680 cylindrical battery cell
CATL prismatic battery cells
Musk has been pushing the narrative that Tesla vehicles will be able to drive themselves for about a decade. This promise culminated with the reveal of the Cybercab robotaxi which will supposedly go on sale in 2026 without a steering wheel or pedals.
""He probably himself thinks it needs five years, but if you believe him when he says two years, you will be in big trouble,” Zang said for Reuters. “The direction is right.""
Zeng met with Musk in Beijing in April and the two often talk about various topics, according to Reuters. For context, CATL is a major supplier to Tesla’s Shanghai factory which assembles the Model 3 and Model Y EVs for local and international markets. Tesla has also licensed CATL technology for its upcoming battery manufacturing facility in Nevada, which is expected to become operational next year.
Tesla’s 4680 cylindrical cell uses a lithium-ion chemistry with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode. Meanwhile, CATL specializes in manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic cells. Recently, the Chinese giant introduced a consumer-grade sodium-ion battery which is even cheaper to manufacture than LFP cells.",Iulian Dnistran
How VW Got A 'Wake-Up Call' That Sparked A Rivian Team-Up,https://insideevs.com/news/740871/rivian-volkswagen-software-venture-cm/,"Plus, Trump prepares to take on California's emissions rules, and we look at Elon Musk's plans for our government.",11/13/2024 11:30,"Anyone who follows the electric vehicle race closely knows that the Volkswagen Group has struggled on the software front for years now. That's a broad term, but it includes everything from in-car subscription services to over-the-air updates to autonomous driving. But what probably no one expected is that VW's tech headaches would lead it to a small but scrappy American startup for help. Now, we have a clearer idea of why that happened.
That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news from the tech and automotive space. Also on deck: President-elect Donald Trump may target California's ability to regulate its own vehicle emissions, and we look at Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big plans for the U.S. government. Let's dig in.
2025 Rivian R1 Internals
It says a lot when the world's second-largest car company by sales needs backup from a startup that's never once turned a quarterly profit. But the new $5.8 billion deal between Rivian and VW is a win for both sides: Rivian gets access to capital it badly needs to cross the so-called ""Valley of Death"" to reach true profitability, and VW gets a ""next-generation electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology"" for future vehicles. And that tech will serve both companies, too; the Rivian R2 is expected to use it, as is the new Scout Motors vehicles and future electric VWs—including subcompact cars, the companies said in a press release.
And VW gets to lessen its reliance on Cariad, the in-house software division originally created to consolidate and advance what used to be disparate efforts spread across many brands. But Cariad has, perhaps infamously now, become a money pit with frequent layoffs amid important new car delays.
The Wall Street Journal today explains the other thing that got VW moving: China.
VW’s big wake-up call was the Shanghai auto show in April 2023, when the carmaker saw firsthand that digital features such as automated driving and voice control were proliferating on Chinese cars, while Cariad kept on missing deadlines.
A few months later, VW announced a deal to collaborate with Chinese startup Xpeng to jointly develop tech-forward EVs. But Steiner said VW knew that using Chinese technology in the rest of the world was a non-starter.  Shortly after, Blume met Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe at the Porsche Performance Center in Atlanta.
The talks ultimately became serious enough for the companies to form “clean teams,” whose members would have been contractually barred from working on similar projects if the deal had fallen through.
Yes, that auto show last year—the first one in China since the COVID-19 lockdowns—was a giant wake-up call to the entire car industry as to how far behind they'd fallen to those homegrown brands. (Which begs the question: how did they not know? It's not like they haven't been doing business in China for decades now.)
And VW and Rivian moved fast here, too:
By early June, they had stripped down a cutting-edge Audi Q6 e-tron shipped from Germany and fitted it with Rivian’s components as a lab project. The teams then started work turning a second Audi into a demonstrator vehicle that could actually be driven. A third Audi remained untouched as a reference point.
“In former times, we had kind of a claim that if something is not invented here within the VW ecosystem, it might not be good enough. Now this is gone,” said VW’s Steiner. “We cannot push the technological barrier in every area on our own.”
Of course, the Q6 E-Tron that's about to be on sale doesn't use Rivian-derived hardware or software; anything coming to the new cars will be from this joint venture, not from existing components, Scout's own CEO told InsideEVs recently.
But the lesson is clear: if any automaker wants a chance in hell to catch up to China's dominance in the EV race, they need to move at light speed on batteries and software. This should at least help with the latter.
California Highway
""How do we compete with China?"" is one of the biggest questions coming up in my discussions with industry officials, analysts and experts in the wake of Trump's successful re-election bid last week. The former president campaigned heavily against EVs (though he softened somewhat when he joined forces with Musk) and has vowed to roll back fuel economy and emissions rules driving more electrification—and end California's longstanding power to set its own rules there.
But this isn't like 2016-2020. That wasn't so long ago, but China's auto industry a decade ago was a cash cow, not a competitive threat. Back off in the EV race and America's automakers sign their death warrants at the hands of BYD; maybe not next year, but eventually.
So Automotive News previews what the re-elected president could be in for if he targets California: lawsuits, objections from automakers who need to stick with one set of rules so they can advance their technology, the state itself as a voting bloc and even the heavy trucking industry that's also signed on the Golden State.
The presence of a contractual agreement between the state and automakers, including BMW, Ford, Honda, Stellantis, Volkswagen and Volvo, plus the state’s continuing responsibilities under the Clean Air Act to maintain a certain air quality will complicate a Trump administration effort to block California’s green energy push.
“It’s obviously open to some question, but I think that the core structures are actually pretty favorable” to California, said Craig Segall, senior vice president of environmental group Evergreen Action and a former deputy executive officer with the California Air Resources Board.
[...] Beyond the agreements, automakers may take different approaches. John Boesel, CEO of clean transportation organization Calstart, said the ones that stay committed to the zero-emission push “will be rewarded in the long term.”
“I do wonder if the president is going to follow through on his previous commitment to undermine California’s authority,” he said. “He certainly seems willing to let states set their own policy regarding abortion.”
“This is the fight that California has been preparing for,” one analyst said. Then again, the same can be said of Trump.
Trump Musk EVs Bromance
You, a normal and sane person, may have seen the news last night that Trump will in fact appoint Musk to ""head up"" a ""Department of Government Efficiency"" alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. No, it wasn't just a campaign meme; it's actually happening. Supposedly.
Musk said during Trump's campaign that he would want to help reduce the size, restrictions and spending of the federal government, although he saves particular ire for regulations that get in the way of his own companies. But what can he really do here, and how will he still run Tesla on top of such a monumental job?
That's because this is more like a consulting gig, it turns out. More from Axios today in its morning newsletter:
Trump said in the announcement statement that the ""department"" will actually be outside the government. He said it could become the ""Manhattan Project"" of our time — a reference to the atomic race during World War II.
Musk said: ""This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!""
Fact check: It's essentially a non-governmental commission with no power other than to recommend things for people in power to do.
Congress could grant it official powers. But lawmakers are skeptical.
It also has an end date, Trump said, of July 4, 2026. So no, if anyone asks, Musk is not going to be leading some cabinet-level new division of the government (like when George W. Bush established the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11) but rather advise on where to cut. And it sounds like Ramaswamy will be managing whatever the day-to-day is.
But no one should underestimate Musk's clout here, especially after delivering such a victory for Trump. If regulations around everything from autonomous cars to spaceflight look different in the coming years, we may well trace it back to him.
Ford F-150 Lightning At Tesla Supercharger
We'll have more on this in the coming days. But given that Trump 2.0 is going to have a very different take on EVs than Biden did, and at a very different time in history, what does success look like in your mind?

The Honda Prologue Is Already Proving Toyota Wrong,https://insideevs.com/news/740597/honda-prologue-toyota-bz4x-sales/,"It may be a GM car underneath, but the electric Honda Prologue is a hit. And it proves people want good EVs from brands they trust.",11/11/2024 16:44,"One of the more interesting—perhaps even baffling—studies that we've highlighted this year is the one that indicated most consumers are convinced that the Japanese automakers are the ones leading the way on electric vehicles. This, of course, is not true; while companies like Toyota, Honda and Nissan pioneered hybrid vehicles and do very well there (the first two, anyway) they are now playing catch-up when it comes to fully electric cars.
But people still think of those brands as ""green"" and trust their generally excellent reputations for reliability and quality. Put simply, people want good EVs from the Japanese automakers. And Honda is proving that to be true more and more every month.
As we have reported before, the all-electric Honda Prologue is proving to be the unexpected EV hit of 2024. The most recent data running through the end of October had the Prologue at 18,309 sales this year; it outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E that month and has already bested the Nissan Ariya and Toyota bZ4X with year-to-date sales. Not bad at all for a total newcomer to the modern all-electric space.
While Honda has had a few U.S. EV offerings here and there like the old Fit Electric and Clarity Electric, the Prologue is Honda's first really serious entry into the space. The base version has almost 300 miles of EPA range, while the top one has 273 miles due to its all-wheel-drive and bigger wheels.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite
Under the skin, the Honda Prologue isn't even a Honda at all; it's a General Motors Ultium EV, made at GM's Ramos Arizpe, Mexico plant alongside its cousins the Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV. Then again, who cares? The specs are good and the whole package has lots of Honda touches, including its own take on the Android Automotive-based software system and—unlike most GM EVs—Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If you can't live without those things, the Honda may be the one to get of the three.
In fact, the Prologue is the subject of a recent Bloomberg story about how Honda is turning its brand loyalists into EV fans for the first time:
MeLissa Jones, a 45-year-old software developer in Utah, isn’t overly concerned about air quality or climate change, but she does love a Honda. The Pacific Blue Prologue that she got in June is her 19th. “It’s not that I really like electric, it’s just that I wanted the new Honda to try it out,” Jones said. “We drove it as soon as (the dealer) got one in.”
[...] Much of the Prologue’s draw lies in just how unremarkable it is. Its starting price — before incentives or fancier options like all-wheel drive — is $47,400, just $400 less than the average market value of all US cars in September, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Unlike many EVs, the Prologue’s performance will set no one’s hair on fire, but it does feature thoughtful and elevated details of the kind Honda evangelists have come to love. There’s a huge storage bin under the center console, for example, a massive sunroof, a supersized smartphone charging pad and a rash of buttons and knobs to preclude a flatscreen hunt-and-peck typical of the Tesla driving experience.
When asked why they chose a Prologue, Honda buyers cite trust in the brand followed by value, according to company spokeswoman Natalie Kumaratne. What’s more, almost two-thirds of Prologue buyers have owned a Honda before and nearly 80% have never had an EV.
Other car companies, take note: this is probably how EVs crack more mainstream adoption. People don't want spaceships, they want good specs and affordable prices from brands they trust. While Hyundai and Kia used the EV revolution as a chance to hit reset on their brand perceptions, there are tons of Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 buyers out there who just want the same cars they've always loved, minus the need for stops at a gas station. It's the way to win over those mainstream, next-wave EV drivers.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite interior
I'd argue that the above is why Toyota's bZ4X has done so well in certain months, especially when extra-generous deals and incentives get involved. But everything the bZ4X can do, the Prologue does better: it has more range, better fast-charging, better software and is, as Edmunds put it, ""a better vehicle in every meaningful way."" Even if it's not the best EV out there, it's clearly delivering what Honda owners want.
And I'd argue it's proving Toyota wrong right now. The bZ4X—which is a car I actually enjoy driving—has tremendous potential. Every time the InsideEVs staff tests the electric Toyota, we get tons of excited questions from curious onlookers; usually, it's some variation of ""Toyota makes an electric vehicle?"" People want EVs from brands they know and trust. If Toyota upped the specs on the bZ4X or maybe had a few other similar offerings in this space, it would be crushing it right now. Yet mere days after an election that could slow down the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle space, Toyota's executives are out there throwing water on California's EV goals. Maybe if they tried a little harder, this wouldn't be an issue for them. (And maybe a little intensified competition from Honda will get Toyota moving.)
2024 Honda Prologue Review
The point is that automakers have to meet people where they are, and the Prologue's steadily increasing sales in its very first year prove that the consumer may just be more ""ready"" than some companies think they are. This race is only going to heat up soon; all of them need to be thinking about whether they have the technology to meet the moment or not.

"Why Hyundai, Samsung And Korea May Stay Ahead In The Trump Era",https://insideevs.com/news/740458/korea-ira-ev-hyundai-trump/,The South Korean automakers and their battery companies bet billions on America's EV race. They see a 'limited' impact now.,11/10/2024 10:13,"Over the past four years, the U.S. has had a president who has aggressively supported clean energy investments and pushed for an electric transformation of the auto industry. In two months' time, the White House will be occupied by someone who's been openly critical of electric vehicles and has threatened to repeal the tax incentives and subsidies backing them.
So what happens to all the car companies, battery makers and supporting firms who have planned huge investments in American manufacturing? That's now the $300 billion question facing the entire industry. And if tax incentives may not exist to encourage EV purchases, those plans could face tremendous headwinds in the coming years.
But for the Korean automakers and battery manufacturers, the answer so far seems to be this: We've come too far to back off now.
That's the gist of this post-election report from Korea's JoonAng Daily, which certainly concedes that firms like Hyundai Motor Group, Samsung SDI, SK On and LG Energy Solutions are in an ""uneasy holding pattern"" ahead of President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump has vowed to end what he's falsely called a Biden administration ""mandate"" for EVs as well as Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies, including possibly EV tax credits and incentives for manufacturing.
Stellantis and Samsung SDI's Kokomo Gigafactory Marks Construction Milestone
But the Korean firms have already made big plans for the U.S., and in many ways, they're significantly further along than most—and they hail from a country that's a key American ally and one of its best opportunities to get ahead of China's battery dominance. While the U.S. may be concerned about China's incursion into the autos space and rise in the world, South Korea is basically next door to the country and has countless reasons not to back down here.
“SK On is bent on expanding U.S. investment regardless of the election results to jump on the bandwagon to contain China, though uncertainties are looming over the downsizing of the Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] in Trump’s second term,” the newspaper reported an SK On vice president as saying during a recent earnings call. “The entire repeal of the law is less likely to happen as some lawmakers in states considered Republican strongholds have recently voiced opposition to the IRA's abolishment... the impact on SK On could be limited.”
According to that story, LG has a similar take:
LG Energy Solution, Korea’s largest battery maker, also said it will push forward with the necessary investment in North America considering various anticipated circumstances such as the scheduled launch of new EVs by client automakers. “With the IRA requiring a strict process and political consensus, the AMPC benefits will be maintained in a broad framework,” said Kang Chang-beom, a chief strategy officer at LG Energy Solution. “The policy package aimed at containing China will surely be tightened no matter who wins, and LG’s position in the U.S. battery market will have to be solidified.""
Since Trump's definitive win last week, few automakers have stepped up to publicly announce what this massive shift in policy could mean for their EV plans—many of which have already been delayed or even canceled amid sales that are rising but out of sync with once-rosy projections. One of the only ones to weigh in so far has been a Toyota Motor North America executive who called California's especially aggressive EV targets ""impossible"" to meet. While it's not immediately clear if that statement was directly tied to Trump's ascension, it does represent the questions that are being asked more openly now.
Hyundai Motors Group Metaplant America (HMGMA)
But that's just one automaker. And one that's admittedly skeptical about EVs and slower to get more of them to market. It's a very different story with the Hyundai Motor Group and the various Korean battery firms that have been developing that technology for decades and also have a vested interest in not letting China get ahead.
Given that the Trump administration is hardly expected to be cozy with China, that's going to be a big part of the calculus ahead, according to Don Southerton, a longtime business consultant who has worked with various Korean firms.
""Based on what we know, President-elect Trump’s leadership will intensify Washington’s anti-China trade policies, so Korean battery firms must prepare to diversify and internalize their supply chains,"" Southerton told InsideEVs. ""If Trump blocks Chinese companies’ entry into the U.S. and loosens the regulations on autonomous driving, I see Korean battery firms benefiting.""
After all, those are the ones who have already bet big on the U.S. As JoonAng Daily noted, South Korea was the top international investor in America in 2023, with ""large-scale projects totaling $21.5 billion last year alone."" LG, Samsung and SK On are building battery plants across the U.S. to supply many automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, General Motors and more—not just Hyundai and Kia.
2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited
By the same token, the Korean automakers got in early and may be in a good position to succeed here. Hyundai's new Metaplant, which will produce the 2025 Ioniq 5 and other models soon, is Georgia's largest economic development project ever. And while that's a red state that went solidly for Trump last week, it's bringing too many jobs to be going anywhere—plus, Hyundai has already confirmed it's meant to be a flexible factory, able to produce hybrids as well as EVs. And extended-range EVs could be on the menu there too.
With more U.S. production coming soon, that means cheaper EVs and cheaper batteries as well. Plus, Hyundai's cars will be the first EVs out of the gate with the Tesla-style North American Charging Stanard (NACS) plug from the factory, granting those cars easy access to Tesla's charging network. Even if the EV tax credits vanish, they could be priced and equipped well enough to succeed on their own merits.
Southerton also echoed much of the present thinking across the industry: even if Trump wants to repeal all aspects of the IRA, that may be logistically tough to do. And the new president would probably have every reason in the world to keep jobs and manufacturing going strong—something he campaigned heavily on.
""In reality, this will take considerable work to roll back, with some severe repercussions,"" Southerton said. ""The Department of the Treasury would have to change IRA regulations and guidelines, which would probably result in litigation regarding IRA loans, guarantees, and subsidies. Trump, too, will need support from the Senate to 'scrap' the IRA. And, across America’s 'Battery Belt,' Republican senators have openly supported the laws to boost manufacturing on American home soil and with plants in red states.""

Toyota Calls California EV Rules 'Impossible',https://insideevs.com/news/740400/toyota-calls-california-ev-rules-impossible/,"A top Toyota executive is challenging California's EV ""mandate."" Is there really one in place?",11/8/2024 17:09,"Despite being a pioneer of hybrid technology since the late 1990s, Toyota has been a laggard in the electric vehicle race. The automaker offers several hybrid and plug-in hybrid models in the U.S., but there's only pure electric model in its portfolio, the bZ4x crossover. The Lexus RZ and Subaru Solterra are the same underneath but wear different clothes.
Toyota plans to launch several electric models in the next few years, including a three-row electric SUV made in America. It has also increased its investments in next-generation battery technologies and building out EV plants in the U.S. And yet, it has resumed criticizing the regulations that call for increased adoption of EVs to reduce vehicular pollution.
Jack Hollis, the chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said California's EV regulations would be ""impossible"" to meet, CNBC reported on Friday. “I have not seen a forecast by anyone … government or private, anywhere that has told us that that number is achievable,"" Hollis said.
For years, California has spearheaded the path towards broader electrification. The California's Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II regulation calls for 35% of new vehicle sales to be zero-emissions from model year 2026. These models can be a mix of plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel-cell models.
""At this point, it looks impossible. Demand isn’t there. It’s going to limit a customer’s choice of the vehicles they want,” he added. If the regulations remain unchanged, it will lead to ""unnatural acts"" and ""distort the industry,"" Hollis said.
It's unclear how it will ""limit"" choice, as consumers will have the option to choose gas, hybrid, or electric cars when they walk into a showroom for years to come. The word ""mandate"" gets thrown around unrestrained these days, whereas the current regulations only encourage increased adoption, not a national ban on gas cars.
Regardless of his remarks, EV adoption remains robust in the state. Some 22% of new cars sold in California through September were EVs. More than half of them were Teslas, but rival OEMs have started catching up. In the third quarter, U.S. automakers sold a record number of EVs nationwide, with experts saying that 10% market share was now within reach.
Twelve other states, including Washington and New York, have also adopted California's standards. Some plan to adopt the standards from model year 2026 onwards, whereas others plan from MY2027. California also plans to ban sales of gas cars from 2035 onwards, but those plans are pending federal approval and risk getting axed under the new Trump administration.
Scaling back the regulations may have a disastrous impact on the planet, which scientists say is already blasting past the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold that nations were hoping to limit warming to. Tailpipe emissions also have an adverse impact on public health and are linked to several diseases and illnesses.

Rivian Is Still Paying For A Big Mistake,https://insideevs.com/news/740352/rivian-q3-financial-profit/,The promising electric SUV and truck startup gets more bad financial news in Q3.,11/8/2024 9:32,"Rivian is having some growing pains, and it really felt them in the third quarter of this year.
On an earnings call Thursday evening, the electric startup announced that production, deliveries and revenue were all down, and a single component is largely to blame. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Rivian was struggling with the ramp-up of its updated 2025 R1S and R1T models thanks to a shortage of a part for its new in-house ""Enduro"" electric motors. Due to a miscommunication with one supplier, Atlanta-based Essex Furukawa, Rivian was unable to secure enough copper windings to get production to where it needed to be.
That shortage was reflected in last night's financials: revenue of $874 million in Q3, more than 12% lower than what analysts estimated. And down quite a bit from Q2's $1.158 billion in revenue.
""This has been a tough quarter for us because of some of those supply chain or supplier ramp challenges,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said on the call. ""And one of those suppliers in particular has limited our production quite substantially and we're working very, very hard to address that. This is one of our highest priorities in terms of the business.
Rivian delivered 10,018 cars in Q3, down from 13,790 in Q2 and way, way down from 15,564 cars in Q3 of 2023. However, there are still signs of optimism for the nascent automaker. In Q3 of this year, production of the new 2025 ""Gen2"" cars was actually up to more than 13,000 cars from Q2's 9,600, suggesting that while these results weren't what Rivian wanted, it is ramping things up and getting past this supplier issue. Scaringe said as much on the call: ""We're seeing this as really a short-term issue, but it certainly introduced challenges as we saw in Q3,"" he said.
Rivian R2
Perhaps more importantly, Scaringe said that these lessons—revamping the R1 models, bringing more components in-house and getting these problems solved—are being applied to the upcoming Rivian R2. That model is seen as key to Rivian's survival as it's a smaller, more midsize and more affordable electric SUV targeting a starting price around $45,000 before incentives.
""The R2 program is advancing,"" Scaringe said. ""From a timing point of view, it's on track. And the product itself is really exciting. It's delivering a level of performance and capability in a package that really looks and feels like Rivian, but it's doing it at a substantial reduction in terms of its overall cost."" Moreover, Rivian's battery partner LG had some exciting news for that car, announcing last night that it will get more advanced and higher capacity battery cells than current vehicles. Scaringe reaffirmed that the target debut for the R2 is still the first half of 2026.
In the meantime, Rivian is hoping that the R1S and R1T can carry it to the point where these new, more mainstream EVs can provide some relief. Soon, Scaringe said, that will come from the debut of the new Tri-Motor models: Rivians with one electric motor upfront and two in the back.
""Performance is better than our first generation [Quad-Motor Rivians], but with a much lower cost in terms of what it takes to manufacture and also with a substantial improvement to efficiency,"" Scaringe said. ""We also expect to see an increase in the R1 average selling price, as we improve our sales mix with more meaningful Tri-Motor sales in Q4.""
Perhaps most importantly, Scaringe said the company still expects a ""modest"" profit in Q4, which would be its first-ever. And Rivian officials reaffirmed that they hope 2025 will provide a ""positive gross profit,"" which would mean it would have to achieve both reliable scale and profitability with the current R1 models. That may be a tough order, especially with still-high interest rates impacting sales of expensive vehicles like the R1T and R1S.
Still, Q3's results were clear: Rivian can pull this off but it has a long way to go. And it literally can't afford mistakes like the one it made with its motor part supplier in the future.

America's EV Revolution Collides With A Second Trump Era,https://insideevs.com/news/740030/evs-trump-election-cm/,Trump has vowed to cancel the Biden administration policies that were driving an electric transition. What now?,11/6/2024 9:45,"What now?
If you have a vested interest in all the progress America has been making to forge a cleaner energy future, including with its automotive industry, the news that President Donald Trump will return to the White House is probably not what you wanted today. As we've covered exhaustively over the past few months, much of the electric vehicle transition in the world's second-largest car market was driven by new policies from the Biden administration. Those included EV charger growth and tax incentives to buy electric cars and build them stateside. Trump has vowed to target those policies if he was reelected, which he was last night in a possible landslide. So ""What now?"" is a pretty valid question for the auto industry, the charging industry, policymakers and the planet as a whole.
On today's edition of Critical Materials, we begin the process of figuring out what that all means.
Without a doubt, you're going to read a lot of reactionary, knee-jerk takes out there today and in the coming days. My goal as the Editor-in-Chief of InsideEVs is to give you something better: something more thoughtful, more thorough and more grounded in reality than what our worst fears may tell us. That's always been the case here, and this team will make sure it continues to be so. Let's dig in.
If you ask any automotive industry chief executive what they want most for the holidays, besides copious bonuses and returns for shareholders, they'd probably say ""regulatory certainty."" And that is very, very up in the air right now.
The Biden administration set a goal of 50% all-electric car sales by 2030. That was backed up by aggressive new emissions and fuel economy rules meant to gradually phase out new internal combustion sales. It was a huge reversal of the first Trump administration's policies, which actually rolled back emissions and fuel economy rules.
Basically, since carmaking is a long-term, capital-intensive business, automakers spend years planning their businesses around ways to meet those regulations; if they change every four years, it creates a tremendous deal of uncertainty around what products to build, what people will want and how to even sell them. Here are some highlights from Automotive News:
“A Trump victory leads to a lot of immediate volatility in the transportation policy space,” said John Miller, who covers sustainability policy for TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group.
With the House majority still in the balance, it’s unclear whether significant changes could come to the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump, without congressional control, still can revisit the act’s implementation guidelines, including those for the individual tax credit, commercial vehicle tax credit and used clean vehicle tax credit.
“Depending on how much [the individual tax credit] would be changed, it could be very detrimental to the North American automotive industry,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. “A lot of the demand for EVs currently is driven by that incentive, and that incentive feeds the manufacturers.”
The new Trump administration may also seek to delay light-vehicle regulations set to come into effect after the 2028 model year, which would also delay regulations for post-2032 model years — as well as eliminate California’s ability to set its own standards. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said this year that California’s waiver to set its own greenhouse gas emissions rules would be “immediately revoked” upon Trump taking office.
As that story notes, a large coalition of automakers has already agreed to meet California's tougher climate standards. But Trump could target California's ability to set those standards as well. Like I said, a lot is up in the air today.
In a career marked by taking big and improbable bets on things everyone else had written off—online banking, electric cars, space travel and more—Tesla CEO Elon Musk's biggest bet yet paid off in a massive way last night.
Nobody backed Trump harder than Musk. From effectively funding and running Trump's ground game in Pennsylvania to turning the pro-Trump volume to 11 on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Musk placed his eggs in the Make America Great Again basket, and it looks like he's gonna come out on top. He may even make good on his claim to advise, or even run, some kind of government agency aimed at dramatically slashing federal spending.
Does this mean that EVs have an ally in the White House? Or will Musk just be looking out for Musk, which to me means cutting regulations around space travel and cementing new ones for autonomous vehicles? And will the Trump-Musk partnership continue to hold steady?
What we do know is that it's already paying off big for Tesla. From CNN:
Early Wednesday, investors were already betting that Trump’s win will also be a win for Musk’s major public holding, Tesla (TSLA), sending shares of his electric vehicle maker up 12% in premarket trading. That lifted the value of the shares of Tesla that Musk owns outright by more than $12 billion, which works out to a better than a 10,000% return on the $119 million he donated to Trump. But there are risks for Tesla, even from Trump’s victory.
Much of Musk’s massive net worth can be traced to the government support his companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, have received over the years. Even if Vice President Kamala Harris had won, much of that money would have continued to flow. But even if some of the government support for electric vehicles is now trimmed or cut off, as is likely with Trump’s victory, Musk’s wealth will remain firmly intact. In fact, Tesla could benefit if government support for EVs ends.
[...] But Musk has said he’s not worried about the end of the tax credit, as Tesla sees it as a boon to legacy automakers’ efforts to move into the EV market and provide more competition.
“Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,” Musk posted on X in July.
Thanks to increased competition, Tesla’s global sales sank 2% in the first nine months of this year compared to last year. Sales and profit managed to improve in the third quarter, but it was the first time the company had ever seen such a drop in its history.
That's one plausible outcome here. Take away the subsidies driving EV manufacturing and development for General Motors, Polestar, BMW and countless others, and they retreat into internal combustion and Tesla gets ahead on EVs.
That, of course, depends on Musk actually wanting Tesla to focus on batteries and electrification and not just autonomy, something we've had considerable doubts about lately.
BMW Mexico battery factory construction
It's not just environmental regulations that are at stake here. Trump also ran with big promises of tariffs on all kinds of foreign-made goods, including cars. Just the other day, he threatened 25% to 75% tariffs on Mexican-made products—including cars—if the country didn't assist in reducing migration into the United States. Earlier, he promised to set a 100% duty on imported cars and trucks to boost American manufacturing, and then doubled that to 200% on the campaign trail.
It's not like the Biden administration, and past ones, haven't done this. Biden kept Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made cars and then boosted them to 100% for Chinese-made EVs. And the Chicken Tax has helped keep America's lucrative domestic truck industry afloat for decades. But implementing stiff new tariffs on a country like Mexico, which exported 2.5 million cars to the U.S. in 2023, would create new levels of uncertainty. It's not like auto factories can be ramped up overnight, and forcing so many cars to be built stateside would no doubt increase their costs.
Fears of anti-Mexico tariffs already put Honda on notice before the election was decided. Overnight, European auto stocks took a big hit as well, fearing the same. And that's on top of the disastrous year they've already been enduring. Via Reuters:
BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said potential import tariffs under the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump may benefit the automaker, even as shares in the German premium carmaker and its rivals fell due to concerns the sector would be hurt by escalating trade disputes.
Fears over import tariffs, which Trump has threatened on goods from the European Union, caused shares in BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche to fall 4.6 percent to 6.4 percent on Nov. 6.
Zipse sought to allay fears after presenting bleak third-quarter results, pointing to the company’s strong U.S. footprint that includes its largest plant worldwide.
The U.S. market accounted for 12.9 percent of the 3.1 million in German passenger car exports in 2023, making it the single-biggest export market for Germany’s carmakers. The U.S. is increasingly lucrative for German automakers because of robust demand for large SUVs and a slower shift to EVs than in Europe, allowing them to sell more of their higher-margin combustion-engine models.
Having covered the auto industry during the first Trump administration, I can tell you this: he says a lot of things. What he actually does is far more difficult to predict, but the mere act of saying it creates a unique brand of uncertainty that a lot of people are scrambling to figure out today.
Rivian Wall Charger
I hope to have more to say on this later, but here is what I do know. The auto industry has always chased two things: efficiency and performance. EVs represent the next evolution of both.
A U.S. government that's less inclined to throw money at the electric transition won't stop it, but it may well slow it down when other players—China, namely—show no signs of slowing down. Rolling back our clean energy goals will have profound effects on our climate, however. And hundreds of thousands of planned manufacturing jobs are now at stake if the policies of the Inflation Reduction Act get repealed.
So where does it all go from here? That's what we intend to find out next.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 Is Surging And The New One Isn't Even Out Yet,https://insideevs.com/news/739806/ioniq-5-sales-october-2024/,The Ioniq 5 had another great month. Again. And the NACS-equipped version is still on the horizon.,11/4/2024 18:40,"You might think a headline about the Hyundai Ioniq 5 having one of its best U.S. sales months ever might refer to the updated 2025 Ioniq 5, which will come from the factory with a charging plug that can natively use the vast Tesla Supercharger network. You'd unfortunately be wrong; that car isn't even out yet. And that makes the month the Ioniq 5 just had all the more impressive.
Hyundai reports that in October, its dealers moved 4,498 examples of the retro-futuristic electric crossover. That would make it the best October ever for the Ioniq 5, and the car's second-best sales month ever since it hit the market in force in 2022. It's also up a whole 51% since October 2023—an impressive result given how uneven EV sales have been this year for several automakers.
Generally, however, South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group has had far more wins on the electric (and increasingly, hybrid) front than losses. As we reported last week, electrified vehicle sales in particular helped Hyundai and its corporate cousin Kia to record October sales. Besides the Ioniq 5, the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe hybrids saw 140% year-over-year growth, and for Kia, the Sportage, Carnival and EV6 all posted record October sales as well. Not all models are created equal, however; the Ioniq 6 only saw 837 sales in October, down an unfortunate 32% since last year. Sedans are a tough sell these days; SUVs, less so.
And the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 continues to make a strong case for itself. Available in rear-wheel-drive or dual-motor all-wheel-drive, it can be had in several forms, including the basic 220-mile SE Standard Range all the way up to the 303-mile RWD SEL and Limited models. (Adding AWD drops range to a still-respectable 260 miles.) Packing an 800-volt electrical system, the Ioniq 5 is a charging monster too, capable of going from 10% to 80% in a manufacturer-estimated 18 minutes on a DC fast charger with speeds of 250 kW or more. Between performance, range, charging and style, it's a tough package to beat.
Moreover, we've seen some extremely impressive lease deals and discounts on the Ioniq 5, so be sure and do your homework if you're in the market for one.
But that package is going to get even better soon. The 2025 Ioniq 5 should be on sale soon, and since it's built in Georgia, it's expected to qualify for EV tax credits at purchase and not just when leased, as most Ioniq 5s currently are. It will also come from the factory with a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to the Supercharger network. Existing Ioniq 5s will be able to do the same soon via an adapter, which should offer the same level of charging performance. And the 2025 Ioniq 5 will also get a more rugged and off-road-focused XRT trim.
Hey, it's American now—it may as well lean into the vibe.

Want Some Good News? Electric Vehicles May Be Getting Less Partisan,https://insideevs.com/news/739783/ev-politics-partisan-study-autopacific/,EVs are radioactive this election season. But a new study indicates that attitudes in America are changing fast.,11/4/2024 14:00,"Here's a crazy idea: maybe, just maybe, not everything in America needs to play into our endless culture wars.
For now, at least, electric vehicles are right in those crosshairs. EVs—and the tax incentives provided by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that will help them get built and bought in America—have become so clouded by politics in 2024 that elected officials can't even campaign on the battery factories being built in their districts. As the U.S. explores a more energy-independent future and ways to compete directly with China's iron grip on battery technology, that kind of knee-jerk partisan pullback feels rather silly.
But politics alone may be less and less of a factor surrounding an EV purchase, according to new data from the industry research firm AutoPacfiic. According to that data, ""political identity is still a factor in electric vehicle (EV) ownership, but it may be becoming less of a factor for future EV acceptance.""
AutoPacific surveyed 12,000 Americans—including EV acceptors, rejectors and current owners—and asked why they did, would or wouldn't consider going electric. Their reasons for or against are the typical ones. They're worried about the still-higher costs of EVs, the prevalence or lack of charging, environmental concerns, challenges with cold-weather range and overall range.
Another reason is political: EV adoption in America so far has been largely concentrated in wealthier, coastal areas that generally lean Democratic. This, coupled with the unpopularity of EV-related tax incentives and widespread misinformation about what critics say is an ""EV mandate"" to ""force"" people to go electric has led to more negative perceptions of these vehicles in more conservative, Republican-leaning areas. Earlier this year, data from Republican political consultant and EV advocate Mike Murphy showed how stark the divide is, and the rhetoric found in the various campaigns across the country has certainly reflected that.
But AutoPacfiic says that as EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids grow across many car brands' lineups and continue to decrease in price, that divide is beginning to narrow. ""Findings reveal that 54% of current EV owners and 60% of current PHEV owners identify themselves as Democrat compared to 30% of EV owners and 26% of PHEV owners identifying as Republican,"" the study said.
AutoPacific's Director of Marketing and Consumers Insights Deborah Grieb added: “Our analyses of EV owners over the years have clearly shown a correlation between more left-leaning political views and EV early adopters. But as EVs continue to expand across brands, vehicle types and price ranges, that association is showing signs of fading."" In fact, the 46% of respondents who said they intended purchase an EV or will consider purchasing one in the future were all fairly evenly split among Republicans, Democrats and Independents.
“When it comes to EV rejection, politics do play a small role, albeit a declining one,” Grieb said. “But rejection of EVs is much more likely to be due to charging and cost concerns.”
And that's much more fair, isn't it? Because unlike political perceptions that often aren't based in fact—including politicians who rail against EVs even as massive projects spring up in their districts to bring tens of thousands of new jobs—problems like charging and costs are real and also fixable. The U.S. is adding as many as 1,000 new EV chargers every week and new and used prices are going down as well. Moreover, it's hard to look at relatively normal and normal-looking electric vehicles like the Chevy Equinox EV and Ford F-150 Lightning and argue that driving one is some kind of ""virtue-signaling."" In reality, this is just another powertrain choice, and one that can often save people a ton of money on things like gas and maintenance over time. Simply put, it does not need to be as political as it is right now.
That's just hard to see from the hyper-charged environment we find ourselves in right before Election Day. As Politico's E&E News reported recently, politicians on the Democratic side have been advised to stay far, far away from anything EV-related; indeed, you won't be seeing Kamala Harris out there touting electric investments the way Joe Biden once did. “Voters really, really hate electric cars, so stop talking about them,"" said David Schor, a progressive pollster with Blue Rose Research, at an event earlier this summer. Meanwhile, these cars have become a cudgel in multiple battleground states, but especially Michigan. Anti-EV ad spending is through the roof and the entire auto industry is in ""wait and see"" mode to find out what those subsidies and tax incentives will look like from 2025 onward.
But that's right now, and any industry-wide transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. Maybe AutoPacific's data indicates people are coming around, no matter who they want to vote for.

More EV Politics

These Red And Purple States Are EV Epicenters. What If Trump Wins?,https://insideevs.com/news/739308/ev-carolinas-election-politics/,North and South Carolina are seeing an EV jobs boom. But politics could change that soon—and who really wins then?,10/30/2024 13:52,"When one thinks of American technology and innovation, Silicon Valley is usually the first place that comes to mind. But in recent years, another region of the United States is going all-in on EVs, challenging the West Coast’s sector dominance. That’s the Carolinas.
North Carolina will be home to Toyota’s upcoming hybrid battery manufacturing facility. It recently saw the opening of European battery manufacturer Alpitronic’s U.S. headquarters and charging giant Kempower’s U.S. office. There’s also Thomas Built’s electric school bus manufacturing facility, VinFast, Natron Energy and more.
Toyota North Carolina Battery Plant Construction
And that’s just one Carolina. South Carolina is seeing upgrades and expansions to plants owned by BMW and Volvo to make future EVs and batteries and, perhaps most notably, Scout Motors’ all-new $2 billion factory to make electric and extended-range trucks and SUVs.
The Southeast’s EV game is proliferating big time, to put it mildly. And much of that is thanks to the investments and tax incentives pushed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden Administration’s signature infrastructure and climate legislation.

But there’s something else notable about the region. North Carolina voted for President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. And it’s likely that Trump could win the swing state again in 2024. South Carolina, Trump almost certainly has in the bag. And begs a question: if the region’s EV efforts flourished under a pro-EV federal administration, what would happen if different leadership was in the White House?
We don’t really know yet. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is expected to continue or even expand those policies; Trump is not, to put it lightly.
But the two states are part of a nationwide boom that few people would want to see disappear if, for example, Trump makes good on his threats to end Biden’s EV and climate subsidies. “We need to future-proof our economy and make sure we're getting modern innovative companies here,” says Christopher Chung, the CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina.
North Carolina’s popularity with electric vehicle ventures stems from several avenues. These include lower labor costs, cheaper taxes, proximity to coastal ports and existing car manufacturing ecosystems and a diversified workforce, thanks to local universities and technical colleges.
“We're a manufacturing state, historically,” Chung told InsideEVs. “If you're looking at doing EV assembly or battery manufacturing, knowing and working with a state that has a strong manufacturing history is really important.
But these factors alone aren’t enough to woo manufacturers considering the state. The rest resides within the locality’s ability to incentivize companies to set up shop. “Incentive packages are usually split at both a state and local level because typically a company is not just choosing a state to do business in, but they're choosing a specific county and sometimes a specific city within that county,” Chung said.
While North Carolina has its arsenal to facilitate EV growth, the federal government can do even more. The 48C section of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides tax credit incentives to businesses in the clean energy space looking to set up shop in the United States. “The 48C tax credit is probably one of the most common ones,” Chung said.
A possible Toyota electric SUV would be powered by batteries from its new North Carolina plant.
Portions of the IRA incentivize companies to establish facilities in the United States. The next part is on the state level. If a certain state offers a competitive incentive package, then there’s a good chance the business will reside in that state. And North and South Carolina just happened to be more competitive states. In other words, the IRA is like a shiny new car dealership. Once you go inside, you’ll choose the car that best suits your needs. (You want a three-row EV with all-wheel-drive? There’s the Kia EV9 for that.)
Chung said these incentive packages are usually complex as they have to weigh out numerous factors. “So our job is to try to understand, of course, what's the employment, investment, and the wages that a company is pledging to put here in the state,” he said. Another factor is what the company has to benefit the state.
Take Toyota’s battery plant, for example. Given the automaker’s huge push to turn most, if not all, of its lineup into hybrids, that plant will be busy for a long time. And while Toyota has been slower than most to embrace fully electric cars, Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina will be set up to support at least two EVs someday. In other words, these are long-term investments, poised to grow over decades—hardly some run-of-the-mill food processing plant.
It’s why, as NC Newsline reported recently, the state is due to receive $3.5 billion in funding from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for a litany of manufacturing projects including EVs.
Despite all the EV interest, North Carolina is very much a purple state. Its liberal, blue metropolises are surrounded by conservative, rural localities. The amalgamation of regions has given the state an interesting voting history. In 2020, North Carolina voted for Republican Trump in the presidential election, Democrat Roy Cooper on the gubernatorial side, and a majority Republican rule in the state house and senate.
But Chung says the political differences have actually helped make the region more competitive. “Anytime you have two parties in control of two different branches, they're going to butt heads on certain policy disagreements,” Chung said. “Like everyone, no one can disagree that educating our people is a good thing to do, but they're going to have differences around what's the best way to do that.”
Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (under construction)
To improve and strengthen the state’s workforce, EV manufacturing simply happens to be a great avenue to do so. It’s advanced technology, and nobody can say “no” to getting these companies to relocate to North Carolina. Plus, some of these investments were implemented in deep red counties. Toyota’s battery manufacturing facility is in Randolph County, a locale with a 211% Republican voter advantage (as opposed to Democrats.)
“The more EVs are seen as job creators, the better they will do politically,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant and founder of the nonprofit EV Politics Project. “Congressmen fight like hell to keep local jobs.”
Positioning EVs as a way to accelerate the workforce, generate revenue, and “future-proof” the economy is one of the most effective ways to dismantle the political barrier.
“The politics of EVs are all tangled up because our country is so partisan,” Murphy said. “You’ve got to move the debate from the environmental stuff to jobs and competition with China.”
Less than two hours south of Raleigh and the situation gets even more complex. Volvo is adding at least 1,300 jobs to its Ridgeville, South Carolina plant just to make the electric EX90—a vehicle whose American production is even more important as Volvo’s parent company faces anti-China tariffs elsewhere. BMW’s famed Spartanburg plant, actually America’s largest car exporter, is getting a $1.7 billion investment for EV production and a battery assembly plant nearby. And Scout Motors is perhaps the biggest coup of all. It’s set to bring at least 4,000 jobs to the Blythewood area and become an ultra-important brand for the Volkswagen Group as it faces tremendous headwinds in Europe and China.
Scout Traveler and Terra Concepts
But there’s little doubt how South Carolina will vote next week. That state is heavily expected to tilt toward Trump, who has consistently promised to “terminate” what he falsely calls “Kamala’s insane EV mandate” while vowing to “rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”
So if he does, what happens to the money driving those investments now—not to mention future EV tax incentives that encourage people to buy those cars? They may well be on the chopping block, and it’s why the Biden White House is now scrambling to allocate as many of those funds as it can in case the election doesn’t go Harris’ way.
Legal experts and industry observers generally believe it’d take an act of Congress to repeal everything Trump says he wants to get rid of. But many of them also believe doing so would mean big setbacks for America in the EV race.
When it comes to governmental forces, there are industrial and regulatory policies, says Levi Tillemann, the author of The Great Race: The Global Quest For The Car Of The Future. Industrial policies “push” money and resources to a specific industry to help it grow. An example of this would be giving a tax break to an electric vehicle manufacturer for building a plant in the country. The other is regulatory policies. Regulatory policies “pull” industries up to certain standards through legal requirements. An example of this is the Clean Air Act, mandating catalytic converters.
“The state that's led all of these efforts has been California, and the reason for that is that California had special authorities granted to it under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “And so [California] created this, I would say, fairly straightforward, but also extremely innovative, synthetic market for zero-emission vehicle credits, where they had the mandate, and then they allowed people to buy and sell credits amongst themselves.”
The Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credit program was instrumental in Tesla’s path to success. It was an example of regulatory policy rewarding those who built clean vehicles like Tesla and fining those who didn’t. It also generated more EVs on the market. The Ford Focus Electric, Chevrolet Spark EV, and Volkswagen e-Golf are just a few vehicles that manufacturers were effectively forced to produce. Were these excellent EVs? Absolutely not, but they were nevertheless first steps that led to bigger things. And now that the U.S., Europe and Japan are scrambling to keep up with China’s advancements in the electric space, they need all the help they can get.
“So if you cut back on your industrial policy, or if you cut back on your regulatory policy, either one of those is going to have a pretty significant effect on the growth in EV manufacturing and the U.S. EV market,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “But if you hit both of them at the same time, then you could see a really significant slowdown.”
Taking an objective look at the industry, it’s clear that governmental efforts can help shape the EV industry. Manufacturing incentives can help steer companies to build in the USA and regulatory policy will require automakers to build more efficient vehicles. But what if someone like Trump is at the helm of these policies?
Trump and his vice presidential pick, JD Vance, have both expressed distaste for the IRA and its pro-EV policies. But more recently, the former president has opened up to a future of electric vehicles—with internal combustion engine vehicles still in the fray. At a rally in Georgia, Trump said, “I’m for electric cars, I have to be because [Tesla CEO Elon Musk] endorsed me very strongly.”
“I think the Trump thing is a little more complex than it looks like, but there's no doubt that he is less sympathetic to EV subsidies,” Murphy said. Even Musk seemed to agree on X, though his various companies have benefitted tremendously from subsidies and government contracts alike.
But even with the IRA in place now, it could be possible for a different administration to stall its implementation process. “I would expect dramatically more narrow interpretations of a variety of tax credits within the IRA. I think that there is a very good chance that the Trump administration would simply fail to administer certain programs,” Tillemann said. “They wouldn't appoint the necessary people or allocate the necessary resources in order to administer certain plants, certain programs that are important to innovation and to expanding EV manufacturing in the U.S.”
Can EV advocates count on Trump and Musk’s newfound bromance to change the calculus? That depends on who you ask.
“I do think that the alliance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could have some sort of strange upside for the environmental and electric vehicle communities,” Tillemann said. “I didn't think that it was going to have much of an impact, but Elon Musk has gone from being sort of a Trump-curious tech executive to Donald Trump's biggest fanboy, and Donald Trump is very easily swayed by people who flatter him and people who support him in various ways, whether rhetorically or financially.”
Murphy, the political consultant, said he saw things differently. “Elon's interests are not necessarily aligned with the EV industry. They're aligned with Tesla,” he said. “I would say a Trump presidency is likely to add a lot of friction to government-supported EVs, slowing things down, maybe going after the tax credits or the lease loophole that help dealers offset the price.”
BMW's Neue Klasse EVs. Its South Carolina plant is expected to make six EVs by the end of the decade.
So will a Trump Administration curtail EV growth and support, if it comes to pass? Surely his role would have some impact, but it’s too soon to say what precisely will happen. But here’s what we do know. Electric vehicle sales are steadily growing, states love electric vehicle jobs, and China is unrelenting with its technological progress.
As Ford, General Motors and others still grapple with making EVs and batteries profitably, it’s clear that there are growing pains on the path to electrification. Any assistance from Uncle Sam—not unlike the stiff tariffs keeping BYD and the like out of our market for now—would be greatly appreciated. And interestingly, both parties have supported protectionist measures against Chinese EVs in the form of tariffs.
“Laws are kind of like a coloring book,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “You have all of these outlines, but then the Administration is responsible for filling in the colors. And depending on what colors you use, that picture is going to look very, very different at the end of the day.”

VW Dealers Call Scout Plans 'Salt In The Wound',https://insideevs.com/news/739302/vw-dealers-scout/,Volkswagen dealers aren't happy about Scout's direct-to-consumer retail plan. They're gearing up for a big fight.,10/30/2024 12:56,"Volkswagen dealers are gearing up for a fight. The company's U.S. retailers are livid over being cut out of VW's new Scout brand, which plans to sell its Terra and Traveler models directly to consumers. So a group of VW dealers is getting ready to challenge VW's plans in court and in state capitols, leveraging their deep connection to state governments, as new reporting from Automotive News details.
“To just show these new vehicles that would have fit very nicely into VW’s portfolio, it’s like rubbing salt in the wound here,” National Auto Dealers Association CEO Mike Stanton told Automotive News. “What’s really different about this is that we’ve got a brand, it’s owned by Volkswagen AG, that is going to compete directly with franchise dealers. That’s not OK.”
Most states bar car companies from directly competing with their own dealerships, and many bar direct sales altogether. Many states have made exceptions or have rules that allow companies like Tesla to sell there, given that it doesn't have any dealers to compete with. But even Tesla's company-owned stores required a decade-long legal battle in countless states, some of which still don't allow Tesla to operate stores. Scout thinks it can follow that model, but the VW connection could prove to be an issue. Many predicted this issue.
As Stanton's quote shows, one of the key arguments the dealers have on their side is that Scout will ""compete"" with VW dealers. That's explicitly against the law in many states. But Scout has two defenses. First, it is not VW. The company has stressed that is an independent company owned by VW. This holds some water. I mean, if Volkswagen bought Rivian, would it have to close its factory stores or sell them off to dealers? The truth is, we don't know, because this has never been tested. Laws require interpretation and application, and this is a gray area.

Another one: Does Scout really compete with Volkswagen? Will any potential buyer of a Volkswagen Toas gasoline compact crossover say, no, in fact, I'll get an electric pickup truck with a bench seat instead? Probably not. But will someone considering an Atlas Cross Sport decide instead to chance it on a more exciting looking EV? Maybe. It's not likely, but on a long enough timeline it'll happen. At the very least, Scout's existence will likely make Volkswagen think twice about pushing toward any more outdoorsy or truckish products. But again, that's not what Volkswagen makes here, anyway.
It's a tricky problem. Volkswagen can argue that a new brand should not have to abide by the franchise agreements of a separate brand owned by the same company. It's not like VW dealers all got the rights to sell Lamborghinis as soon as they acquired that brand. No, the fight here has a broader angle: Dealers are threatened by direct-to-consumer models, and have enshrined protections from them in many state laws. A company store model from your own parent brand is a death knell, especially when Volkswagen itself is in rough waters.
This probably won't be stealing Jetta buyers away from VW stores. But it could be an attractive upgrade for someone who wants a more interesting, more capable, electric Atlas alternative.
The dealers are certain to leverage their deep pocketbooks and deep state government connections. VW is going to take advantage of its even deeper pocketbook. The fight will be messy. As Stanton told Automotive News, the NADA is going to fight anywhere it can fight, using any argument it can make. ""Everything’s on the table right now,"" Stanton said.

Women Are Lagging Behind In EV Adoption: Study,https://insideevs.com/news/738642/gender-gap-in-bev-adoption/,"Women tend to be less familiar with EVs, and they have worse dealership experiences.",10/24/2024 13:20,"We’ve known for a short while now that the road to mass EV adoption has been fraught with roadblocks unrelated to the vehicles themselves. Now, we're hearing about another issue. A new study from the analytics and data firm Escalent found out the whole EV sphere is overwhelmingly male-dominated; Men make up 71% of EV owners and 74% of EV shoppers. That’s much higher than the average for all light-duty vehicles, where men are estimated to make up about 65% of the market.
It looks like the EV revolution is leaving many women behind. The answers why are both complicated and entirely unsurprising for any person who has ever bought a car from a dealership.
The study noticed that even the way that men and women research their future purchases is different. “Men are significantly more inclined to explore their options via online research (71% compared with 64% of women), videos (34% versus 27%), online forums (22% versus 15%) and vehicle-building tools on manufacturer websites (22% versus 17%),” the study said. By comparison, women the study surveyed rely on in-person experiences: 65% of women studied did test drives, compared to 60% of men. This in-person experience is the start of where women are getting left behind.
“To sort of overly simplify, men care about range and battery life. I mean, there are some other concerns in there, but those are the two big ones,” said K.C. Boyce, vice president of the Automotive & Mobility and Energy team via Zoom call. Boyce said that while the women the study surveyed certainly do care about the range or charging experience, they also tend to have more questions in general that go beyond just the vehicle powertrain specifics.
“[Women] tend also have a lot of other questions about the [vehicle ownership] experience broadly. Like, how do I install charging at home? What does that look like? Where do I charge when I'm out in public? Do you know if it is going to take longer? Is it going to cost more? What is, you know, depreciation look like on an EV? There is just of a lot more kicking the tires, if you will, that women are doing,” Boyce continued. And as readers tell us all the time, many conventional dealer employees aren't good at answering those questions. Some treat EVs as an afterthought.
Nikki Stern, Escalent’s senior insights manager of the Automotive & Mobility and Energy team, was quick to say that the in-person car-buying experience wasn’t just the only lynchpin to the BEV gender gap. After all, you can get an EV from a company like Tesla, which doesn't have traditional dealerships and tends to have better answers to common EV questions. So buying experience issues don't tell the full story.
“Women are much less familiar with the BEV powertrain than males are,” Stern said. Stern said that lack of familiarity has a trickle effect. The women the sturdy surveyed, as a whole were less familiar and weren't able to get the knowledge about the powertrain. Also, they were less likely to know someone who has a BEV. “When you're less familiar with a product, you tend to have lower opinions of it because you don't really know much about it,” said Stern. Stern also said that women the women surveyed tend to use the same brands and products they trust or use and buy things based on things they’ve heard from people they know. If the people in your circle aren’t exposed to EVs either, then, well, it’ll be hard to have a positive, informed opinion about EVs. The study showed that only 30% of women it surveyed were familiar with EVs, but that number was 55% for men.
As a whole, both Stern and Boyce said that there’s a real education problem for all genders when it when it comes to EVs. Most consumers don't have enough information to make a confident decision. Boyce said that as a whole, BEV shoppers want to know about battery life, driving range and cost of ownership. “[Shoppers] are getting information about it, but [shoppers] are saying, “yeah, not sure this gives me the warm fuzzies that [BEV ownership is] going to work for me,” said Boyce.
Stern insisted that to help close the gap, brands and dealerships need to understand what women’s EV concerns are, where women’s EV knowledge and familiarity are compared to men and figure out a way to ease those concerns and assist them in their buying process. Escalent’s study found that 38% of EV shoppers liked messaging that favored education compared to technology, environmental, practicality and emotional messaging.
Clearly, consumers of all sorts are in desperate want of clear and informative communication when it comes to buying an EV. And if the EV transition is going to work, it can't leave any of them behind.

There’s Enough Lithium In Arkansas For The World’s EVs. Extracting It Is The Issue,https://insideevs.com/news/738449/lithium-source-arkansas-evs/,A new study says there’s nine times more lithium in Arkansas than the projected need for EVs globally in 2030.,10/23/2024 13:30,"A massive source of lithium has been discovered in Arkansas which could shift the global production scales in the United States’ favor and establish a local supply chain that would no longer depend on countries like Australia and South America.
Lithium is a key product needed for rechargeable batteries of all kinds, including those that power electric vehicles–that’s why they’re called lithium-ion. So finding new sources is a big deal, especially when we’re talking about reserves so big they could satisfy the projected needs for the entire world’s EV batteries in 2030–at least nine times over.
According to a new study from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), there are anywhere between 5 to 19 million tons of lithium in southwestern Arkansas. To come up with these figures, researchers used a combination of water testing and machine learning. But here’s the kicker: extracting clean lithium out of there is difficult, time-consuming and possibly not very cost-effective.
More Stuff Like This
That’s because the massive lithium reserves are present brines located in a geological unit known as the Smackover Formation, the USGS said. These brines are high-salinity waters associated with deep salt deposits that can be traced back to an ancient sea.
Moreover, scientists are weary of how much lithium could be commercially extracted and warn that their estimates are exactly that: estimates.
“We estimate there is enough dissolved lithium present in that region to replace U.S. imports of lithium and more,” said Katherine Knierim, a hydrologist and the study’s principal researcher. “It is important to caution that these estimates are an in-place assessment. We have not estimated what is technically recoverable based on newer methods to extract lithium from brines.”
Incidentally, the same Smackover Formation is a historic site for oil and gas production where the salty, lithium-rich brine is brought to the surface as wastewater from these operations. This liquid can be processed to extract the precious chemical, but it’s not easy.
Traditionally, the brine would be left in ponds until the water evaporates and the lithium can be scooped up, but this is time-consuming and requires a lot of physical space for the ponds. Another faster method is called direct lithium extraction (DLE) which uses chemical solvents or filters to separate the lithium from the water, but the technique is still in its infancy and there are concerns about the potential toxic waste left behind.
ExxonMobil–yes, the American oil and gas juggernaut–is reportedly already working on tapping the huge lithium resources buried 10,000 feet under Arkansas’ surface. According to The New York Times, the company has already drilled exploratory wells in the state and plans to start production in 2027, with the ultimate goal of becoming a “leading” lithium supplier for electric vehicles. As reported by The Verge, the fossil fuel giant purchased drilling rights across 120,000 acres of land within the Smackover Formation in Arkansas.
The United States relies on imports for more than 25% of its lithium, so tapping this new source would be a global game-changer that would put America at the forefront of lithium production. Another lithium-rich brine source is California’s Salton Sea. Now we just need to extract it without making a mess.",Iulian Dnistran
Ford Is Paying Its Dealers To Order F-150 Lightning EVs. Here’s Why,https://insideevs.com/news/738093/ford-paying-dealers-f-150-lightning/,"Dealers can score up to $22,500.",10/21/2024 3:35,"Ford F-150 Lightning sales more than doubled in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, but the American automaker wants to move even more units. To do so, dealers will have to play ball, whether they like it or not. But Ford has something in store that’s sure to entice franchises: cash.
According to a bulletin sent to dealers seen by Cars Direct, Ford will pay its partners up to $22,500 to order new F-150 Lightning electric trucks from its Retail Replenishment Centers (RRC) which are meant to make distribution easier ahead of a big model year change.
Until November 15, Ford will pay dealers across the country $1,000 per unit when ordering an F-150 Lightning from a Retail Replenishment Center and not directly from the factory. If a dealer orders over nine units, the bonus is boosted to $1,500 per EV. The maximum is 15 units for a bonus of $22,500.
More Ford Stuff
The XLT, Flash, Lariat and Platinum trims are eligible for the program, with the Pro notably absent from the list–it’s already the cheapest version of the F-150 Lightning and it’s mostly intended for fleets.
Ford said in its letter that the program is meant “to further test the logistics and efficiencies of RRCs and to increase RRC engagement.” As a reminder, the company’s Retail Replenishment Centers were first detailed last year for dealers who were part of the now-defunct EV certification program. Their main purpose was to reduce the costs of selling EVs for franchise owners, all while giving them an incentive not to stock too many electric cars–fewer cars on the lot means less floor space is needed.
Ford’s delivery centers, which are similar to General Motors’ fulfillment centers, ship EVs to dealers within an average of seven days, according to Mike DeYoung, the automaker’s senior director of sales and advertising, quoted by Automotive News.
It’s worth noting that while dealers may benefit from manufacturer incentives, these won’t necessarily translate into savings for customers, so do your homework before ordering a new F-150 Lightning. That said, Ford is currently offering some pretty sweet deals for the all-electric F-150, such as 0% financing for 60 months and a free home charger, including installation.
In the first nine months, Ford sold 22,807 F-150 Lightning EVs, a year-over-year increase of 86%. Overall, the Dearborn-based automaker sold 67,689 electric vehicles from January to September, up 45% from last year’s 46,671 units.",Iulian Dnistran

Renault 5 E-Tech Electric 2024
I'm a bit ashamed to admit this but as an American, I don't really think about Renault all that much. (Sorry, everyone.) But I've been thinking more and more about the French automaker these days because its newest designs are absolutely fire: the new electric Renault 5, the new Renault 4 E-Tech and others have me wishing this brand would give the U.S. market another go.
Frankly, Renault is going to need all the firepower it can muster. Nearly all the European automakers—the Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and so on—are losing market share like crazy in China and their home turf at the same time. So at the 2024 Paris Motor Show, which commenced on Monday, those car companies shored up their defenses with new budget EVs.
Here's Bloomberg:
With drivers balking at the high cost of owning electric vehicles, Stellantis NV, Renault SA and Volkswagen AG plan to showcase their latest budget EVs at the biennial event that starts Monday. Their aim is to turn around a slump that started last year when governments began pulling back incentives to ditch combustion engines.
The stakes are high for the new models to succeed. Chinese rivals led by BYD Co. are gaining market share in the region with cheaper models. And if the European carmakers fail to sell more EVs, they’ll be on the hook for as much as €15 billion in fines for failing to meet stricter fleet emissions-reduction targets.
“The mood is not great around EVs right now — there’s not enough charging infrastructure, there’s volatility on price, but let’s see,” Renault Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo said. “We are really trying our best.”
Renault is at the forefront of the affordability push, unveiling plug-in models in Paris including the R4, which is expected to cost less than €35,000 ($38,269). It’s also showing off the new R5, a €25,000 electric version of a 1970s gasoline car that offered fuel-efficient transport during a time of soaring oil prices.
Other examples include Stellantis' new Chinese joint venture Leapmotor, the Skoda Elroq, some new electric Mini Coopers and so on.

As is the case in America, the overall car market is shrinking because people are fed up with high prices and high interest rates, so more affordable EVs like these are the right move for now. The problem is that China's automakers are making serious inroads into Europe too, and they're hardly just sitting back and letting the home team score some runs (or goals, I guess I should say, since this is Europe we're talking about):
BYD is bringing EVs and plug-in hybrids to Paris including mass-market models competing with the French and German cars as well as Tesla Inc.’s Model Y. In a bid to demonstrate its technology prowess, BYD also will be showcasing the Yangwang U8, a luxury SUV costing around 1 million yuan ($141,509).
Guangzhou-based Xpeng Inc., which has a partnership with Volkswagen, will present its upcoming P7+ sedan, a longer-wheelbase version of the €50,000 P7 that competes with more expensive mid-size models from BMW and Mercedes.
While manufacturers including Great Wall Motor Co. and Nio Inc. are absent from the show, a number of Chinese automakers have sent their staff to Paris to discuss potential partnerships, market entries and European production with local manufacturers and dealers.
And China still has a tight control over the part of EVs that matters the most: the batteries. Plus, it has the edge on labor costs, though we can't pretend that situation is all sunshine and rainbows.
Do Europe's automakers have a fighting chance here?

What do Donald Trump and Akio Toyoda have in common? At least one thing that I can think of: both are convinced that the move to EVs will have a disastrous impact on employment in the auto sector, which is a crucial part of any country's economy and certainly the global one. Toyoda seems to consider himself not only chairman of the world's largest automaker by volume but also the vanguard of Japan's auto sector and the millions it employs; Trump never passes up an opportunity to spread doom and gloom about EVs on the campaign trail.
It's no secret that EVs need fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles do. So how bad could the jobs impact really be? Right now, research points to ""maybe better, actually"" or ""a bit worse than now."" In other words, it depends on who you ask and how they culled their data. Here's The Detroit News:
But emerging research on the topic — including a new, first-of-its-kind study from the University of Michigan — suggests that vehicle manufacturing won't see the job losses EV skeptics have warned of, though the impacts will be mixed. The UM study suggests that building electric vehicles requires more labor — or in other words, more jobs — than gas-powered cars over a plant's first 15 years or more of making EVs.
""(R)apid widespread loss of employment at vehicle assembly plants is a smaller risk than many fear,"" the team of researchers led by Ph.D. engineers Omar Ahmed and Andrew Weng wrote. That finding, though there are important caveats, conflicts with Trump’s comments on the topic.
Analyses on other areas of the automotive supply chain, the UM team pointed out, suggest a wide range of job impacts. For manufacturing of battery cells poised to replace traditional gas-powered engines, two leading studies indicated there could be a jobs boom.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and McKinsey & Company estimated that battery cell manufacturing in an all-EV auto industry could represent 107,000 or 71,000 jobs, respectively. Those would be significant increases over the roughly 57,000 engine manufacturing jobs in the United States.
A third study from Argonne National Laboratory, however, suggested that battery cell manufacturing might only be responsible for 31,000 jobs in an all-EV market. Trump has played to fears of such a decline.
So the jury's kind of out, but I have a very hard time believing this will be some extinction event due to electrification alone; intense competition in this space (see above) is the far greater threat.
I also think that so much of the rhetoric around EVs ignores the jobs that are coming or are in play right now due to investments in this space, including and especially right here in America. To that end...
Pilot Travel Centers LLC, General Motors and EVgo charging station
Maybe some automakers are culling back their EV plans and delaying certain models as sales grow, but not at the level they expected in 2024. I tend to think of this as I do with artificial intelligence: the initial hype wave is over, and now the serious players are settling in for what will be a long war and not some overnight transformation.
But don't think investments in the space are slowing down. Not at all, and especially not in the U.S. Here's one example from Bloomberg again:
The Biden administration is poised to loan nearly $671 million to Aspen Aerogels Inc. to make a key component of electric car batteries in the election battleground state of Georgia.
The conditional financing, being announced Wednesday by the US Energy Department, will fund construction of a new manufacturing plant producing thermal barriers that help prevent battery fires. It’s part of President Joe Biden’s push to build a domestic supply chain for electric vehicles and the advanced batteries that power them.
“We are making sure that the supply side is made here in this country,” Jigar Shah, director of the Energy Department Loan Programs Office, said in an interview. “We have taken very seriously the onshoring of the entire supply chain.”
Or how today, a Canadian miner announced General Motors will contribute $625 million to a Nevada joint venture for battery-related materials for EVs and hybrids. Or how a Stellantis-backed Silicon Valley startup called Lyten will invest more than $1 billion into ""the world's first factory for lithium-sulfur batteries,"" also in Nevada.
The lists go on and on, and I think it's fascinating that we have three examples like that on one day. But don't think this technology is going anywhere; the alternative is that America lets China continue to take the lead it, and no sane person on the business or policy side in the U.S. wants that.
Renault 5 E-Tech Electric (2024): The exterior colors
I can't even remember the last time I saw a Renault on U.S. roads (perhaps this one possibly abandoned one I see in Manhattan from time to time) but in the last couple years, it's quietly upped its design game. As more Americans seek affordable EVs, I wish that new Renault 5 had a path to sales here. But between the battery issues and the tax incentive rules around local production, I'm certainly not holding my breath.
Your turn: what EVs do you wish were sold in your neck of the woods?

BMW Chief Says EU Must Cancel 2035 Gas Engine Ban,https://insideevs.com/news/737569/bmw-ceo-cancel-2035-fuel-ban-eu/,"BMW and Mini are doing pretty well on the EV front, so why is Oliver Zipse going down this road?",10/16/2024 3:59,"BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse said during this year’s Paris Motor Show that the European Union must cancel the upcoming 2035 ban on vehicles that emit carbon dioxide. In doing so, the German automaker’s chief added fuel to the fire that has been slowly burning in the EU ever since the Bloc approved its emission-cutting regulation last year.
The plan, which went into effect in April 2023, imposed a fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions limit of 95 grams of CO2/kilometer for new cars sold in the EU this year, while vans must not exceed 147 g CO2/km–values extracted from the outdated NEDC testing procedure. From 2025 to 2030, new cars must slot below 93.5 g CO2/km while the limit for vans goes up to 153.9 g CO2/km–but on the newer and stricter WLTP testing. However, the limits will get stricter after 2030, and from 2035, all new cars and vans sold in the EU must be emissions-free.
""A correction of the 100% BEV target for 2035 as part of a comprehensive CO2-reduction package would also afford European OEMs less reliance on China for batteries,"" Zipse said at the Paris Motor Show, quoted by Reuters. ""To maintain the successful course, a strictly technology-agnostic path within the policy framework is essential,"" he added.
More From Europe
In other words, BMW Group’s head honcho says the upcoming ban will only force Europe to rely even more on Chinese batteries for making electric vehicles–the vehicle category expected to almost completely replace combustion vehicles after 2035.
It’s worth noting that the EU regulation doesn’t ban gas or diesel vehicles outright, but rather forces automakers to come up with vehicles that don’t emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Fuel-cell vehicles and even e-fuel-powered cars will be allowed, but the infrastructure for these is extremely limited, as opposed to the EV charging infrastructure that is growing at a rapid pace.
Zipse said the mood in Europe was “trending towards one of pessimism” and that the region needed a new regulatory framework to remain competitive. The ban “could also threaten the European automotive industry in its heart,” he added. The regulation will “with today’s assumptions, lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole.”
BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse with the BMW i Vision Dee Concept
Chinese automakers, which–in case you weren’t paying attention–are gobbling up more and more market share in Europe, are exclusively focused on all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, often at very competitive prices. These cars sip less fuel–or none at all–and the long-term savings are significant compared to ICE vehicles.
Even with the recently approved import tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which will go into effect next year, automotive powerhouses like BYD are confident that if they play the long game, they can’t lose.
""We are now hearing that many companies are going back to combustion engine cars. But if the whole world switches to electric cars in five years, they will not be ready for it because they have not invested,"" said BYD President Stella Li said in an interview with a German newspaper. ""In the long term, that is very dangerous. It will kill these car manufacturers.""
The 2025 Mini Cooper SE is currently made in China by Spotlight Automotive, a joint venture between BMW Group and Great Wall Motor.
Sales of all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in Europe were down 4% in the first nine months of the year compared to 2023. All-electric cars, however, saw a steady 12% year-over-year increase in September, while PHEVs went down 12%, according to data from Rho Motion. Globally, BMW AG is doing well on the EV front, with 266,151 units sold in the first nine months, up 22.6% from last year.
But the bigger issues here are a slowing car market in general, with EU sales going down 18.3% in August, and the unpleasant prospect of paying billions of euros of fines if the emissions limits aren’t reached. This money could be otherwise invested in zero-emissions vehicles, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which, coincidentally or not, includes BMW Group.
This isn’t the first time someone opposed the carbon-slashing regulation in the EU. Volkswagen and Renault, as well as the Italian government, proposed that the CO2 targets be loosened or delayed. That hasn’t happened, though, so the limits will be enforced as per the law.",Iulian Dnistran
The Honda Prologue Is 2024's Surprise EV Success Story,https://insideevs.com/news/737314/honda-prologue-sales-q3-2024/,"It turns out people really wanted good electric cars from Honda, and the 296-mile Prologue EV is doing it for them.",10/14/2024 10:49,"You have to get up pretty early in the morning to outfox the Ford Mustang Mach-E. It's spent a few years now as one of America's top-selling electric vehicles that don't come from Tesla, and it took the top non-Tesla crown this year after the Chevrolet Bolt bowed out of the market. But now, and perhaps unexpectedly, an unlikely competitor is gaining fast on the Mach-E: the Honda Prologue.
The recent analysis of third-quarter U.S. electric vehicle sales data from Cox Automotive has some very interesting trend lines. One thing that stood out to us in particular was just how well the Prologue is doing in its first year on the market and as production really starts to ramp up.
According to the data, the Prologue became America's fifth best-selling EV in Q3, behind, in order, the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck and Mustang Mach-E. So for non-Tesla EV sales, that means the Prologue takes the silver medal. And with 12,644 Prologue sales in Q3, it was only off the Mach-E's numbers by 748 units.
Granted, the Mach-E will probably keep the non-Tesla leader status by the year's end because it's just been on sale in volume for much longer. But the fact that the Prologue is catching up so quickly to a hit like the Mach-E says a lot about how much people want good electric Hondas.
I'd also add that the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is no sales slouch either, and, in addition to being one of the best-spec'd EVs around, seemed like it could possibly take the non-Tesla sales leader position this year. But now it has tough competition too.
This is a nice outcome for Honda's first modern EV, but perhaps it's not too surprising. American car buyers still tend to equate Honda and Toyota with being ""green"" car companies since both were such pioneers in the hybrid arena (and still do very well sales-wise with electrified models.) This summer, we featured a survey that indicated Honda and Toyota were considered EV leaders in the U.S., despite both automakers being actually reluctant to embrace full electrification.
But clearly, people want good EVs from those brands; on the months when good deals and discounts could be found, Toyota's bZ4X showed massive growth. It's a clientele that wants dependable and reliable technology and is probably more inclined to ""green"" than fans of other car brands.
And the specs on the Prologue are pretty legitimate. With front- or dual-motor all-wheel-drive, up to 296 miles of range from its 85 kWh battery and a design that doesn't scream ""I'm an electric spaceship,"" Honda's EV crossover hits a lot of sweet spots for mainstream success. Honda is even throwing in a home EV charger and help with some installation costs on the Prologue, making it kind of a turnkey choice for people going electric for the first time.
Sure, underneath it actually uses General Motors' EV platform and batteries, but I'm not sure many customers know or even care. (And GM's Ultium platform is strong on its own, with electric sales from the American automaker showing serious gains too.)
Oh, and it has Apple CarPlay, unlike GM's EVs. No wonder it's doing well.
Honda 0 Series Prototype
The question now is what Honda's electric future will look like. It's cleat that while the GM-based Prologue is popular, it's also kind of a stopgap until Honda can get its in-house EV operations up and running. That includes huge battery and car production hubs in Ohio and Canada and a novel approach to EVs that aims to emphasize lighter weight, interior space and better tech. But we have questions about that approach too, like whether these next-generation Honda EVs will look as out there as the 0 Series Concepts that debuted at CES this year, and what it means if they launch with a more expensive flagship sedan.
With any luck, Honda will be able to deliver something that can capitalize on the Prologue's success. And as interesting as the 0 Series models could be, a moderately-priced, good-range family crossover may just be the proven play instead.

Tesla's Robotaxi Event Can Be A Win If It Brings Us What We Really Want,https://insideevs.com/news/736859/tesla-robotaxi-event-affordable-model/,Here's a hint: it's not actually the Robotaxi. It's what the EV market really wants.,10/10/2024 10:45,"There's an old Steve Jobs-ism that I think about a lot as we cover what's next in automotive technology: ""People don't know what they want until you show it to them."" And as Jobs himself admitted, that's a kind of derivative of something Henry Ford famously said as he sought to democratize the then-new automobile: ""If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would've told me a faster horse.""
Though they only apparently met once, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is certainly an admirer of the Apple co-founder—or at least, of his playbook. Today's ""We, Robot"" Tesla Robotaxi demo at a Hollywood studio in Burbank, California feels like the kind of show Apple would've put on at the peak of its cultural relevance.
But those famous quotes resonate another way, too: we don't really know if people want robotaxis and fully driverless cars yet. They do, however, very clearly want more affordable electric cars. And with any luck, Musk will give the world some long-awaited news on that front.
Put more directly, there is very little evidence right now that people are drawn to purchase certain cars over others because of their automated driving assistance systems. Whether it's General Motors' Super Cruise, Ford's BlueCruise or even Tesla's own Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, people generally check those boxes or get them with a purchase and say ""Huh, this is interesting."" They don't often seek those cars out because of those features. That's something we hear quite often anecdotally from EV owners and prospective ones.
It's also backed up by data. Research firm AutoPacific’s 2024 Future Attribute Demand Study indicates that autonomous driving aids, to say nothing of full autonomy, don't really drive car purchases: ""Despite a growing number of automakers offering hands-off semi-autonomous driving systems for use on highways, they’re not yet among the most demanded features by today’s vehicle shoppers,"" the study said. ""Rather, two simpler and more affordable safety-enhancing automated features have climbed their way into the top 10 most-wanted features list."" What people want instead, the study says, is more basic automated features like rain-sensing windshield wipers, cross-traffic alerts and automatic emergency braking.
Tesla FSD V12.4.1
That may also be because the vast majority of people, driving cars that are on average 13 years old in America, don't have much experience with systems like Super Cruise—to say nothing of full-blown robotaxis. Google's Waymo is objectively the leader in that field at this point, but even those cabs only run in three cities.
Let's put aside the questions of whether Tesla can actually deliver on this technology and pass countless regulatory hurdles after more than a decade of undelivered promises—and admittedly, those are huge things to put aside. When we do, it's clear that Musk is about to sell people on something don't know they want, and betting the farm on the idea that they will when they see it.
But we do know this for certain: people want more affordable electric cars.
The cost of entry is still one of the biggest barriers to going electric. It's true that new car prices have shot up globally since the pandemic, and that EV costs are generally higher still. In August, the average new electric car cost $56,575 before any tax incentives or discounts, according to Cox Automotive.
Now, that's changing fast, especially with a glut of new affordable EV options coming to market in the next few years. There's the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV, which could start around or below $30,000; the Kia EV3; whatever Ford's ""skunkworks"" program is cooking up; the Jeep Renegade, and a few others.
Tesla Cybercab Robotaxi teaser shots
So where's Tesla in that crowd? We really don't know. Musk has been back and forth on that one. Plans for a more affordable ""Model 2""—not an official name by any means—had been in the works for years. That vehicle, built in a new platform, was meant to push Tesla's cars into even more customers by being perhaps the most affordable new EV in the U.S. At one point, production of the affordable model was meant to start at Tesla's Texas factory in the second half of 2025.
But in April, sources within the company told Reuters that Musk put that plan on the back burner to focus on its robotaxis instead. Musk then said Reuters was ""lying,"" but followed up by saying that the next ""more affordable"" Tesla would not only be built in tandem with the robotaxi but be a mix of old and new platforms. Here's what we reported at the time:
“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” Tesla’s first-quarter earnings release said.
The company elaborated somewhat in Q2's earnings call release as well in July: “Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.”
So where that project stands now is unclear. Some have speculated that Tesla will pull a rabbit out of its hat and offer a truly new car that undercuts even the Model 3 and Model Y; others fear that it could be something like either of those with cloth seats. While Tesla has a great deal of its stock price riding on projecting ""success"" with its robotaxi demo, some analysts also want proof of life for cheaper future cars as well.
Tesla Model 2 rendering rear
“I'm looking for three vehicles (most are expecting two) and I believe we'll only hear production timing on the Model 2, which I expect to begin late in 2025,” wrote one analyst with Deepwater Asset Management, which invests in Tesla. “This timing is a few months later than what Elon's comments suggested on the June earnings call. The one wild card could be [that] the more affordable Model 2 is actually a stripped-down Model 3, which would be viewed as a negative by investors.""
It would be a negative for customers as well. Because let's face it: the Tesla brand could use a boost. Between Musk's becoming the most vocal booster of a presidential candidate half the country hates and its own aging lineup, Tesla's market share and public image are shrinking fast. Proving it's still truly in the game of making and selling cars, and not just ceding sales to General Motors and Hyundai, would be a needed boost for the brand and for Musk as well.
Maybe people really don't know what they want until they see it. But Tesla could score a win here by giving people what they do want.

More Tesla Executives Exit Ahead Of Robotaxi Debut,https://insideevs.com/news/736762/tesla-exodus-top-officials-leave/,"Last week, four top Tesla executives who directly reported to CEO Elon Musk announced their departures on LinkedIn.",10/9/2024 15:55,"Several high-ranking officials have left Tesla ahead of the much anticipated Robotaxi Day event on Thursday, according to multiple farewell posts on LinkedIn.
The exodus started with the departure of Nagesh Saldi last week, a long-time Tesla executive and the company's Chief Information Officer for the last six years, as Bloomberg reported. Saldi was invloved in building out Tesla's new data centers in Texas and New York. The data centers house ""supercomputer clusters"" which are supposedly critical in training the automaker's AI and self-driving systems.
On Oct. 1, Tesla's Director of Public Policy and Business Development Jos Dings announced in a LinkedIn post that he was resigning after spending nearly eight years at the company.
In the post, Dings said he contributed on things like automated driving regulations, clean vehicle and fuel credits and making European Superchargers more accessible. Business Insider was the first to report these departures.
Five days after that, Tesla's Global Vehicle Automation and Safety Policy Lead Marc Van Impe also said on LinkedIn that he was leaving after serving Tesla for over eight years.
Impe said he worked with regulators to move the needle on safety and autonomous vehicle legislation and regulations and also contributed to the Robotaxi project. He has since started a policy advisor role at SpaceX, Elon Musk's second largest company after Tesla.
The post capturing the challenging work culture at Tesla was written by David Zhang, the former Program Manager of the Model S, Model X, Roadster and Next Generation Vehicles.
Some of the moments he highlighted included ""rebuilding the cooling tube line in Reno overnight after a less than satisfactory 1 a.m. line walk with the boss"" and ""endless days and nights in the tent at Fremont, hand-building SX Refresh RC cars."" He told his followers last week that he was moving on.
This follows the departures of other top-level Tesla officials earlier this year when Musk laid off the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Some of them were re-hired and others went on to work for other firms.
This included Rebecca Tinuchi, Tesla's former senior director of charging, Drew Baglino, chief of battery development and Rohan Patel, global director of public policy and business development.
That means eight of Musk's top deputies who once reported directly to him have left the company over the past year. Now Tesla has only three executives in top leadership as per its corporate governance website: CEO Elon Musk, CFO Vaibhav Taneja and Tom Zhu, senior vice president of automotive.
All eyes are on Tesla this week as it prepares to reveal the highly-anticipated Robotaxi, a self-driving car Musk claims will revolutionize transportation with a low-cost taxi service akin to a mix of Uber and Airbnb.

GM Pushes On With The Key To Its EV Future: Profits,https://insideevs.com/news/736719/gm-ev-profits-cm/,"General Motors has good news on the EV front. Meanwhile, Volkswagen tries again and Honda hedges its bets.",10/9/2024 10:33,"As 2024 has dragged on, I've increasingly come to think that the electric vehicle transition is less about cars that plug into something and more about control over the energy future. That future is battery-powered—for home generators, mobile devices, grid power and much more beyond cars—and gaining control of the battery supply chain and battery costs is where car companies can lead the way. And General Motors is making some real progress on that front.
Today on our Critical Materials morning news roundup, we look at three so-called ""legacy"" carmakers and their approach to EVs: GM, Volkswagen and Honda. Let's dig in.
Chevy EV Lineup 2024
GM CEO Mary Barra promised that 2024 would be a kind of do-over year for its aggressive future electric car plans. After all, 2023 saw countless setbacks with battery production, software challenges and other headaches. I'd say that in the past couple of weeks alone, we've seen strong evidence that it's working: EV sales in Q3 alone topped 70,000, and at yesterday's Investor Day event, Barra and her team offered some promising news on the profit front.
""We believe our EV losses have peaked this year and we’re focused on significantly improving profitability next year,"" Barra said. She added that GM is aiming for ""positive variable profit"" in this quarter.
I'm very proud of InsideEVs' team coverage yesterday on all of this so I won't recap it all here. But I will stress that one of the biggest things keeping down EV adoption is how unprofitable they tend to be for automakers; they don't control much of the battery supply chain or production methods and batteries themselves continue to be costly. Now, both of those factors are changing fast, and GM appears to be leading the way. Here's CNBC's take:
The EV tailwinds are split between savings from increases in volume and lower costs, including for raw materials and battery production.
[GM CFO Paul Jacobson] said GM’s capital spend also is expected to be consistent in 2025 with this year. GM’s 2024 financial guidance includes anticipated capital spending of between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion.
GM has improved its EV variable profit by more than 30 points year over year through the third quarter, Jacobson said.
GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday the automaker is on pace to produce and wholesale about 200,000 EVs for North America in 2024, achieving profitability on a production, or contribution-margin basis, by the end of this year. That guidance is down from a prior target of 200,00 to 250,000 EVs, which had been lowered from as high as 300,000 units.
Also assisting GM’s earnings in 2025 are expected reductions to fixed costs, which have come down by $2 billion over the past two years net of depreciation and amortization, as well as relatively stable demand and incentive spend by the automaker.
By contrast, let's look at Ford. It's done some groundbreaking things with EVs over the past years. But the fact that sales aren't in the hundreds of thousands annually yet, and the fact that it continues to lose money on the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, led it to punt some plans back a few years and cancel one electric model entirely.
Either way, if you want more EVs, they have to make money. And even as GM revises some of its battery plans, it seems to be getting there.
Volkswagen brand CEO Thomas Schaefer with the Volkswagen ID. 2all Concept
At this point, I'm extremely skeptical of any automaker who says they'll have ""X number of EVs by Y year."" I can't even keep track of the claims Volkswagen alone has made on that front; here's an article from 2019 that promised 70 electric VW Group models by 2025. (That isn't happening.)
But this latest pledge seems somewhat more realistic. I can't find the original source interview from Germany's Auto Motor und Sport quite yet, but Reuters picked up a quote from VW brand CEO Thomas Schaefer that claims eight new EV models are on the way by 2027:
""We have to produce our vehicles profitably and put them on the road at affordable prices,"" the publication quoted him as saying. It also reported that the ID.2 small car model would be developed in 36 months instead of 50 months.
This was probably made as Schaefer debuted the new Volkswagen Tayron/Tiguan, which is kind of its bread and butter these days as it sorts out its EV strategy. As we've covered routinely this year, VW is facing a raft of challenges with labor costs, uneven demand for EVs and lower sales in Europe and China—not to mention competition with Chinese EV newcomers.
Honda Series 0 Prototype
Honda announced some very exciting things at its Tech Meeting event in Japan, which our own Kevin Williams covered extensively with more coming today. A lot of that involves new factories in the U.S. and Canada to produce this next generation of high-tech cars.
But Honda's not completely committed, or at least, is staying flexible, its CEO told Bloomberg:
Honda Motor Co. said it’s open to altering its electrification roadmap if demand for pure battery cars continues to wane, a sign the Japanese automaker may ultimately join international peers in walking back electric vehicle targets.
“There’s enough room to adjust the time line of establishing EV factories globally and change our strategy should things move in an unexpected direction,” Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe told investors at Honda’s technology day last week. That could include delaying setting up some battery production lines, he said.
But it's worth noting this aggressive R&D spend should yield technologies that can be deployed on all sorts of cars, including hybrids:
The company has also developed compact e-Axle systems, which combine motors and inverters, to make EVs more spacious, it said. It will also apply a new welding technology, which helps to make car frames lighter.
Here's hoping the company figures it out, because Japan Inc. so far doesn't look especially competitive as a long-term EV player.

Speaking with Britain's Autocar magazine, AMG CEO Michael Schiebe was highly confident that buyers will have no problems switching from a big ol' V-8 engine to electric.
""Customers who came to the brand because of the V-8 did not come because they just wanted to have a big engine. They came because they loved the technology that we put into the car. So when it comes to electric driving, I'm pretty sure they will jump into that new technology because it will be the latest and greatest that you can get.""
The gist of this statement is that AMG wants us to believe Affalterbach's clientele consists of people who prioritize technology. If the latest developments don't have a combustion engine, customers will apparently transition to EVs. Sooner or later, the ""one man, one engine philosophy"" will come to an end, and it looks as though Schiebe believes people won't hesitate to embrace EVs as long as it has the newest tech.
But the V-8 engine isn't dying anytime soon. AMG has promised it still has new eight-cylinder models in the works. A recent spy video indicates the CLE63 could be the next in line to get the V-8 treatment. Reports state that the top-tier CLE was supposed to have a downsized electrified powertrain but weak demand for the C63 has prompted AMG to change the engine late in the development stage.
Although exact sales figures for the C63 are not available, massive discounts in Germany indicate it's not exactly popular. The C63 is not the only AMG to lose its V-8 since the GLC63 has also dropped the twin-turbo 4.0-liter unit. In addition, Mercedes has already announced the next E63 won't have eight cylinders.
Referring to the plug-in hybrid 2.0-liter setup in a previous interview, Schiebe admitted some AMG customers ""take time to really be excited for the technology."" He went on to say that ""it's important to be open-minded when it comes to technology."" Looking further back, Schiebe defended the company's decision to put a four-banger in the C63 by saying its plug-in hybrid setup is ""very, very progressive.""
In AMG's defense, it is putting money where its mouth is. Not only has it launched several high-performance PHEVs, but it's also developing a bespoke electric car platform. The AMG.EA architecture has been several years in the making and Autocar understands a purely electric supercar is in the works. It'll apparently take after last year's Vision One-Eleven concept and should serve as a spiritual successor to the quad-motor 2013 SLS AMG Electric Drive.
AMG has already ruled out doing another F1-powered hypercar to follow up on the One because of increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Lower in the vast Mercedes lineup, there are still plenty of six- and eight-cylinder models, and even a massive V-12 in the Maybach S-Class.
Generally speaking, there's still time to buy a car with the right amount of cylinders but there are fewer and fewer options.

Even Toyota Knows The End Of Internal Combustion Is Near,https://insideevs.com/news/736270/toyota-end-of-ice/,"""There is a decision being made now as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,"" the company's chief scientist said.",10/5/2024 12:00,"Every company, whether it makes gadgets or home entertainment or software, wants its own technology to win. But it also has to go where the market is going. I'd say that's even tougher in the automotive world these days as global regulations push car companies toward a zero-emission future.
The world's largest automaker by production and sales volume, Toyota, gets this too. And even as it's been behind the curve on purely electric vehicles, its success with hybrids has it plotting the end of pure internal combustion.
Toyota's chief scientist admitted the company is discussing the end date for its non-electrified cars in America, he told Bloomberg this week.
“In the U.S., there is a decision being made now—and I’m not a part of it—as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,” Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist, told the outlet in an interview. “Just the fact that we’re thinking of that means that, OK, it must be close.”
That may come as a surprise to anyone who's passionate about Toyota's (admittedly very good) internal combustion engines, like the rowdy little three-cylinder in the GR Corolla or the almost-the-last-of-its-kind naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 in the Lexus IS 500 F Sport. But if you pay attention to Toyota's sales, you might realize this is the way things have been going for a while.
Toyota's track record with EVs hasn't been all that great. Its three electric offerings in the U.S. (if we count the related Subaru Solterra as well) are pretty outclassed in range, charging time and overall tech by competitors from the U.S., South Korea and Europe—to say nothing of the Chinese automakers that are leading the way.
But those electric models are still selling quite well, and especially, so are Toyota's hybrid models. Toyota pioneered hybrid tech and now has the biggest lineup of electrified cars of any automaker. In September, nearly half of its U.S. sales were EVs or hybrids. It's moved the ubiquitous Camry to an all-hybrid setup, meaning one of the few four-door sedans to still sell in any meaningful volume in America is now an electrified car.
For Toyota, that's the future. Not purely ICE vehicles. Company officials have hinted at times that the eventual plan is an all-hybrid-or-electric future in America, but this is one of the clearest admissions yet as to where things are going.
Pratt has been with Toyota for almost a decade now and is also the CEO of the Toyota Research Institute. Before that, he held leadership roles at the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and MIT. This is all to say that he's a smart guy and when he talks about climate matters, he knows what he's talking about. In that Bloomberg interview, he admits to being “thoroughly depressed” by the growing amount of CO2 emissions driven by human activity. “If you’re not scared by this curve, then you’re not seeing it right,” he said.
At the same time, Pratt has been a vocal proponent of Toyota's own skeptical approach to pure electrification as the future of cars. The automaker has instead argued for a ""multi-pathway"" approach with many different automotive powertrains depending on customer needs, whether those are hybrids, hydrogen vehicles or pure EVs. (It's also worth noting that, again, any company wants its technology to win. And two out of those three things have been driven by Toyota itself.)
There are two ways to look at that approach. The more critical one is that hydrogen power for passenger cars really isn't panning out so far and that hybrid vehicles, while much cleaner and more fuel-efficient than pure ICE ones, still generate carbon emissions, unlike EVs. But the other, perhaps more pragmatic way to look at it is that anything that takes pure ICE off the road is progress and that it's easier to get people into hybrids—for now, anyway—than it is to shift the entire market in a fully electric direction. Just this past week, Toyota said it would join other automakers in pushing back EV production in the U.S. amid concerns over uneven demand.
“What I’m trying to emphasize in my talks now is please, please, please, we all want the same thing, but let’s stop the wishful thinking,” Pratt said in that interview. “Let’s think about what really is going to occur, what human nature is like, what politics is like, the capital that folks don’t have to change their cars, and let’s find a way that accepts the reality of all those things, and let’s change what we actually can change.”
But I would say that no matter how you want to think of the evolution of car technology, the world's biggest automaker admitting that pure ICE has some kind of end date is a very big deal. In the near future, every Toyota for sale in the U.S. could be a hybrid, an EV or perhaps a hydrogen car. And that speaks volumes about where everything is going.

I’ve Been Running An EV Publication For A Year. Here’s What I’ve Learned,https://insideevs.com/news/735732/insideevs-2024-2024-recap-sales/,Transforming a society centered around gas-powered cars is proving harder than expected. And it requires thinking differently.,10/3/2024 15:35,"The concept of entrenchment has been on my mind a lot lately.
I have covered the auto industry as a journalist for more than a dozen years and have been a car enthusiast my entire life. Even so, I can truly say it’s hard to understand how entrenched the car industry is in modern society until you pay close attention to what happens when things start to change.
After a year at the helm of InsideEVs, I can see those fault lines more clearly than ever.
I'm grateful to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team of reporters, editors, video creators and contributors. 2024 isn't even over yet and it's been the wildest and most uneven year yet for the electric vehicle revolution, which to us feels both inevitable and also millions of miles away. We get more news to cover in a day than many publications get in a week.
But covering the EV shift must be like covering the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s; most people don't yet understand the magnitude of change we're all facing. What's going on right now isn't just ""cars that you plug in."" It's the rise of the battery economy and the war over who controls it. It's the transition from fossil fuels to a hopefully more sustainable future. It's automation, jobs and widespread economic upheaval. It's a software-driven transformation of how we'll get around someday, with all the good and terrifying things that entails.
I'm not even sure that the car companies can see all of that, either. That's because change is not a concept anyone is used to when it comes to cars.
The world as we know it today is built around the automobile. We have spent a century building a society where a car is an absolute necessity for daily living in most places. A sprawling ecosystem grew around that idea and in support of it: gas stations, highways, insurance providers, dealerships, repair shops, even suburbs. We have generally accepted as normal that a car purchase would be a normal part of life. Even if we don’t always see it, internal combustion touches almost every aspect of our lives.
Now, almost all of that is changing because it has to. Blame global air pollution or a looming showdown with China or just the inevitable march of technological progress. But the era of the EV is changing almost every part of how things have come to work.
Over the past year, I’ve seen every sort of reaction to those changes, from the car companies to consumers to the many institutions that support both. Some automakers are winning thanks to their forward-thinking embrace of what’s next; others are suffering because they realized going from 100 years of internal combustion to batteries and software is far harder than just saying you’re going to.
Lithium-Ion Battery Assembly
Millions of consumers are buying EVs in record numbers, albeit not as many as projected. Others curse the idea of being “forced” to go electric eventually. The dealers aren't happy, the parts suppliers worry for their future, the startups are figuring out how they're going to survive, and in America, much of what happens next may ride on what happens in the coming weeks.
I wanted to share a few major observations about our current moment. These are based on countless conversations with our readers—actual EV owners and prospective buyers—and people inside and around the auto industry, the public policy space, the tech sector and beyond. And from those conversations, a few big things keep coming up.
It’s actually rather unfortunate that the EV race is heating up in the era of 8% interest rates and record-high new car prices. Particularly during and after the pandemic, carmakers banked on the idea that people would just get used to paying $50,000 for family crossovers from now on.
Guess what? Squeezed out in every other area of their lives, they're now saying “No thanks.”
2026 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Rendering Rear
Even more so for the privilege of driving something more expensive that they didn’t understand and didn’t know how or where to “fill up.” (More on that later.) But when we ask people why they don’t want to go electric, “it’s too expensive” is one of the most common refrains we hear. And I certainly don’t blame them.
Hopefully, the next wave of cheaper models will change hearts and minds.
But let me put this as bluntly as I can: Everyone must now look at some of these car companies and ask, what is the point of you?
We now can tell the difference between the automakers whose leadership, engineers, designers and even rank-and-file folks are excited about EVs and the ones who are being dragged kicking and screaming into it by emissions and fuel economy rules.
It’s why so many automakers are freaked out by uneven electric sales. It’s an industry largely just used to people showing up like they always have. RAV4 owners buy more RAV4s. Silverado owners buy more Silverados. Much of the Nissan lineup feels like “the same car everyone else makes, except worse, but cheaper.” They’re not used to pitching a new, innovative product to a skeptical audience.
But I’d ask these same automakers what they’re actually doing to convince their customers of the real benefits of going electric. Until fairly recently, the move has been to toss them some Electrify America credits and let the dealers handle the rest, which they often didn’t.
As I started writing this, Ford announced it would hand out complementary Level 2 home chargers and cover most installation costs. That's the right way to play this. It's the kind of outside-the-box thinking they all need to be trying.
Education is key too. Car companies have been generally terrible at this in the EV era. Most people can’t explain how an internal combustion car works beyond “Gasoline goes here” and now they’re getting tossed into the deep end of a new world, one full of kilowatt-hours and charging curves and battery preconditioning.
2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Infotainment Review
I got an email a few weeks ago from a gentleman in his 80s who bought a Hyundai Ioniq 5 and did not know how to find fast charging with it. That’s a failure. I don't see a lot of effort to keep that sort of thing from happening again.
Put more bluntly, many of these car companies are just not going to survive this transition. Not if they can't commit to making the very best technology or offering the greatest value proposition while going the extra mile to educate consumers.
Many of them are failing to make cases for themselves—cases for why they’re really better than the competition that’s out there now and getting more intense each year. It’s hard to look at where things are going and feel good about Jaguar or half the Stellantis portfolio, let alone whether the world would be any worse off if those entities ceased to exist.
Like the good former city desk reporter that I am, I have a list of car company obituaries ready to go for when that day comes. The list is getting longer and longer. And if those companies can’t answer that question above, they’re probably on it.
There's perhaps no greater example of entrenchment than the group of people who have legally cemented themselves into America's new-car buying process and then collectively decided that they aren't down for what's next because it's expensive and hard and requires learning new things.
I can't say all car dealers are averse to selling EVs. Many are doing well on this front. But as a whole, and perhaps more importantly as a lobbying arm, they're going to be a bigger barrier to EV adoption than most people think. And the automakers get this, too; they just can't say anything publicly about their ""dealer partners.""
There are countless examples of this, like the 150-odd Cadillac dealers who cashed out rather than get ready to go electric or the challenges to Ford's EV sales plans or even how Hyundai's much-publicized Amazon pilot seems to be stuck in neutral.
Maybe things will start to change. Ford and GM seem intent on training those partners to get ready for what's next. And 32,195 GM Ultium-powered EVs don't just sell themselves in one quarter.
But if they don't, some big automaker is going to bring the hammer down, and the rest will follow suit when they do.
Entrenchment works both ways. Try reading our emails anytime InsideEVs writes about Apple CarPlay or Android Auto—specifically, the lack thereof in some new cars. People are furious about it and they simply will not buy cars that don’t have the smartphone mirroring systems.
Mercedes MBUX Apple CarPlay
Yes, in-car software is night and day better than it was even a few years ago. Try telling people that. Some two decades of dismal tech experiences have them clinging to what they know.
No automaker wants to cede the software future to the tech companies. But even if they really can find ways to become software giants on the same level as Apple and Google, I’m not sure they’ll ever be able to convince their customers to join them.
Mitsubishi i-MiEV Charging
Like the CEOs of General Motors and Ford, the continued knee-jerk reaction to EVs along partisan lines has surprised me too. Sure, our modern perception of EVs was born a decade ago from rich people in California driving Teslas. But in the end, it’s just technology. It doesn’t need to be partisan or inherently only for the politically left-leaning.
Considering that Florida and Texas are some of the top EV-adopting states behind California, I think plenty of people are starting to understand this too.
But there's been an upside to the prevalence of EVs in our wider national conversation: the rise in popularity of hybrid cars. The lack of charging infrastructure, or even the perception of it, is still the obvious barrier to EV adoption. In the meantime, people are waking up to the benefits of electrification with cars that are more familiar to their current lifestyle.
Nobody likes paying for gasoline. That isn't just going to be bad news for the fossil fuel industry; it already is.
A mere four years ago, probably 80% of the cars we write about daily on InsideEVs didn’t exist yet. The ones that did are now completely outclassed by modern EVs at range, charging times, software features and automated driving assistance tech.
I’ve never seen advancements happening at that rate in the car world before this.
I'm sometimes shocked when I hear things like GM claiming to have PHEVs available in the U.S. market by 2027. I wonder if they know that may as well be 50 years from now, the way things are going. That’s another aspect of this entrenchment thing: many of these companies, and their vast supplier networks, simply aren’t built to move that fast.
Again, it’s no wonder why. Things were always set up to work one way. Customers just showed up and everything else was just a fight over market share—battles over little things like design and features and horsepower, not owning the technologies that will define the future.
It’s not just the cars that are getting better. It’s the charging infrastructure too. People don’t often realize this, but charger growth in America alone is happening at an extremely rapid rate.
But there are two problems at work here. One is that chargers still aren’t getting built at the same rate as EV adoption, thanks to roadblocks around the installation of fast chargers and the fact that not enough is being done to get charging access to people who aren’t single-family homeowners.
The other problem is that this progress really depends on where you live. If you’re in New York, even New York City, things are night and day better than they were even a few years ago. In Nebraska or Idaho? Not so much, unfortunately.
Earlier this year, we launched a story series called EV Myths Discharged. The goal was to dive into some of the most pervasive misconceptions about electric cars out there, while still being factual and fair.
Running this series has been like trying to keep my basement from flooding with a tablespoon. There’s so much misinformation out there that it’s hard for us to keep up with. There are many reasons for this, from lies spreading on social media to intentional clickbait from so-called “traditional” news outlets to documented disinformation campaigns from Big Oil. The stories from ordinary EV drivers who are happy with their purchases get drowned out by the stories about extreme cases or straight-up lies.
Again, entrenchment. Gas cars are the norm, and any deviation from that is scary and worthy of hostility.
I’m also disappointed by the EV coverage I see from other outlets. While there are many thoughtful, well-researched, well-reported perspectives out there, much of what you see is rampant fanboyism, short-sighted “good quarter, bad quarter” financial reporting, or just open hostility from people who think owning a gas-powered car is, or should be, some kind of civil right.
Much of it ignores the fact that adoption of new technologies rarely happens on a straight, up-and-to-the-right line, or it neglects the environmental reasons behind the entire transition. Or fails to pay attention to the massive, massive amounts of investments still going into battery tech, new factories and software. I can’t predict the future more than anyone can. But I will say this: if you’re covering this world, make sure you don’t end up like this guy.
And no matter what happens, I'm always excited for what's next. It beats being bored at work every day.

Volvo Still Wants Europe To Ban Sales Of New Gas Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/735667/volvo-wants-new-gas-car-ban/,The CEO argues that going purely electric is the best way to cut emissions.,12/25/2024 7:28,"Volvo was among the first legacy automakers to announce the gradual demise of its combustion engines. As early as the beginning of 2021, it promised to go purely electric by the end of the decade. That's not happening anymore, but the Swedes insist Europe should still ban sales of new cars with gas engines by 2035.
Bloomberg got a hold of a declaration signed by Volvo and 49 other companies urging the European Union not to change the target. According to CEO Jim Rowan, the most efficient measure the automotive industry can take to reduce emissions on the continent is to ban sales of new ICE cars: ""Electrification is the single biggest action our industry can take to cut its carbon footprint.""
Volvo is not the only automaker on that shared declaration as Rivian also wants the EU to stick to its plan of abolishing gas and diesel cars by the middle of the next decade. Bloomberg points out other automakers refused to sign the declaration but other big names outside of the car manufacturing business did, including Uber and Ikea. Tesla isn't mentioned in the report, even though just like Rivian, it only sells EVs.
It's important to mention there's an asterisk next to that ban. The European Commission wants automakers to stop selling cars that generate harmful emissions, so ICE engines are not banned per se. In theory, that leaves the door open for new vehicles powered by combustion engines running on synthetic fuel or even hydrogen. Germany demanded this exemption, and the EC has pledged to elaborate a legal route for cars with combustion engines that run on carbon-neutral fuels to stick around after 2034.
In the meantime, Volvo has killed one important type of combustion engine and has promised to never bring it back. In late March, the last diesel car rolled off the assembly line. By 2030, plug-in hybrids with gasoline engines and purely electric vehicles are projected to account for 90-100% of total sales.
Six years from now, the Geely-owned brand believes only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models"" are still going to be around. PHEVs and EVs already represented 48% of shipments in the second quarter of the year, with Volvo estimating 50-60% for 2025.
At the beginning of the year, Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said the 2035 ban could be delayed. Earlier this month, Italy's Minister of the Environment and Energy Security declared ""the ban must be changed"" as the ""ideological vision"" has failed. Gilberto Pichetto Fratin added the proposed ban is ""absurd"" and that Europe ""needs a pragmatic vision."" His sentiments are echoed by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she believes the ban is ""self-destructive.""
Whatever happens in Europe, it will have global ramifications since the biggest players in the automotive industry develop and build cars on the continent. If a certain brand won't be allowed to sell its gas car from 2035, that company might not achieve the necessary economies of scale and could kill that ICE model globally.

European Automakers May Feel The Heat Amid Dockworkers Strike,https://insideevs.com/news/735919/dockworkers-strike-puts-european-brands-at-risk/,We also discuss Kia's plans to enter Japan and how Xpeng will fight the EU tariffs.,10/2/2024 11:26,"The auto industry is highly globalized. The Toyota, Tesla, Honda, Ford, Chevy or Hyundai you drive daily likely has parts manufactured across continents. This diverse supply chain helps automakers reduce costs and access expertise. But it's also vulnerable to any form of disruption, like tariffs, geopolitical tensions and what we're seeing this week: the dockworkers strike.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping up the world of electric cars, software defined vehicles and autonomous tech.
In other news, Kia plans to sell its futuristic-looking electric vans in Japan, where Hyundai Motor Group has struggled to capture even a tiny fraction of a market long dominated by homegrown behemoths. Meanwhile, Chinese automaker Xpeng has several options to tackle the European Union tariffs.
Automakers selling cars in the U.S. rely heavily on shipments arriving at the East and Gulf Coast ports. But the workers at these shipping ports are now on strike. It's their first big strike in nearly half a century, and Reuters has broken down how that could be detrimental to the economy and particularly to the auto industry.
The 45,000 port workers who went on strike this week are part of the International Longshoremen's Association union that is negotiating with the United States Maritime Alliance employer group for better wages and some assurance against automation impacting human jobs.
Experts say a few days of striking won't have huge impacts on the auto industry. But if it stretches up to a week or beyond, then automakers could feel the squeeze. That means fewer cars arriving at dealerships, fewer parts getting delivered for repair and maintenance and longer waiting times for consumers.
The strike could impact European carmakers for both exports and imports. Some experts went as far as calling this strike a ""tragedy.""
Here's more from Reuters:
""If (the strike) turns into weeks, it's going to be a tragedy,"" said Steve Hughes, CEO of HCS International, which advises the auto sector on shipping issues.
European automakers, many of which use the ports on strike, would be the most affected, Levy said in a research note.
""The European (automakers) lean heavily on Baltimore for imports and Southeastern ports (i.e. Charleston) for exports, as most of their U.S. production exposure is in this region,"" he said.
The news wire reported on Wednesday that BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo are all closely monitoring the situation as those premium brands rely heavily on shipments arriving from Europe. The strike might affect General Motors and Ford too, but less so compared to their European rivals.
In fact, GM and Ford vehicle imports are mostly routed through rail and truck from Canada and Mexico. So they may even stand to benefit from the strike as it can ease the pricing pressure if supply doesn't match demand and if more buyers looking at European EVs turn towards American carmakers.
Either way, if the strike continues, it would impact the record EV sales projection for 2024. Some automakers like GM and Hyundai Motor Group already reported a banger third quarter for EV sales. A prolonged strike could skew their production and sales targets for the remainder of the year.
Hyundai Motor Group has struggled for decades to penetrate the Japanese car market, which is dominated by Japanese giants like Toyota and Honda. According to Automotive News, Kia hasn't sold cars in Japan since 1990. Hyundai only reentered that market in 2022 after an unsuccessful stint in the aughts that forced it to pull out in 2009.
But remember the super cool commercial EVs that Kia revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show in January? Kia calls them Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV) models and those EVs, according to the brand, might be successful in Japan.
Kia will start its Japanese onslaught with the PV5 in 2026, followed by PV7 and more models later in the decade. It will partner with Tokyo-based trading company Sojitz Corporation for distribution.
They won't ride on the E-GMP platform that HMG's passenger EVs use. They will ride on a dedicated commercial EV platform instead that allows bidirectional charging, DC fast charging at up to 150 kilowatts for a 10 to 80% charge in 30 minutes and an estimated battery capacity of 80-100 kilowatt-hours.
Whoever purchases the Kia PBVs will have access to a high degree of customization, like various seating layouts, luggage compartment shapes, door options, battery capacities and more.
Rivian proved with its Amazon EDVs that delivery drivers deserve to have a better day at work with spacious, feature-rich cabins and also look cool while doing so. Other automakers seem to agree and are now offering their versions of what they think are cool, modern and futuristic electric vans.
Just like BYD, Geely and SAIC, Xpeng has big plans to expand its electric car business in Europe. Despite the looming tariffs on Chinese-made electric car imports, Xpeng won't back down.
The Guangzhou-based automaker that Volkswagen has a 5% stake in, plans to have several options on the table to sidestep the EU tariffs.
Here's more from Bloomberg:
“We’re looking at multiple options, ranging from contract manufacturing to working with existing plants, or even thinking about [new] plants,” Vice Chairman and Co-President Brian Gu said in a Bloomberg TV interview from Berlin on Wednesday. “But those are still very preliminary.”
EU members will vote on Friday to finalize the definitive tariffs on Chinese EVs—as high as 45%. The only way the tariffs don't come into effect is if 65% of the member states, or about 15 countries, vote against the tariffs.
The price war in China is forcing many local players to expand overseas. While that puts automakers at risk as geopolitical tensions remain high, it can ultimately be good news for consumers. If Chinese automakers do expand with European or North American plans, the increased competition should ultimately benefit consumers.
If the dockworkers' strike goes on for a while, it could be a real test of the resilience of America's auto industry, which is already undergoing a massive disruption amid the bumpy rise of electric cars.
Is this another major sign for U.S. automakers to bring production home and localize supply chains even further to develop flexibility and immunity to sudden disruptions? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Toyota Drops Meaningless Name For Plug-In Hybrids,https://www.motor1.com/news/735224/toyota-drops-prime-name/,"The ""Prime"" nameplate is dead. From now on, Toyota will just call them plug-in hybrids. As it should be.",12/25/2024 7:28,"""Prime"" is dead. Toyota announced on Thursday that its naming scheme for plug-in hybrid trims of the RAV4 and Prius has been dropped. Instead, the cars will be called the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. As it should be.
The Prime name first appeared in 2017 with the introduction of the Prius Prime, based on the then-new fourth-generation Prius. The first RAV4 Prime appeared in 2019, making headlines with its combined 302 horsepower and claimed 5.5-second 0-60 time.
""The switch to the RAV4 Plug-in name is intended to help consumers more easily identify the powertrain choices among RAV4 models,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""In addition to the model naming change, the Toyota logo on the front and rear of the vehicle will no longer have a blue “halo” within.""
The Prime name might've sounded cool, but it made things tough for normal shoppers who just wanted to know what they were getting. This switch will make it far easier for people to understand the differences in powertrain offerings without having to load up Google on their phones.
Aside from the badging switch-up, the RAV4 Plug-In continues into 2025 with no changes. That means standard all-wheel drive, an estimated 42 miles of all-electric range, and a combined 38 mpg when in hybrid mode.
The 2025 Prius Plug-in Hybrid continues similarly, with the same 220 hp as last year's Prime model, 44 miles of electric driving range, and up to 52 mpg combined, depending on wheel size.

Anti-China EV Policies Won't Protect America Forever,https://insideevs.com/news/735092/china-tariff-panel-critical-materials/,"Or rather, America's auto industry, experts say. For now, tariffs buy time. ""Then the question is, what will we do with our time?""",9/25/2024 11:14,"You may look at the auto industry's current chaos in Europe and think that those problems won't come to America. That this country is now taking aggressive steps to protect its auto market with 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs or a software ban that will effectively prohibit those cars from being sold here entirely. From that, you may think that it's all problem solved—the U.S. keeps new players from China out for good.
But the truth is that these protectionist measures are temporary at best, and even the auto industry seems to get it. Or at least, the smart folks in the business do.
That leads off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and industry news. Also on tap today: Hyundai's online sales program with Amazon seems to hit the skids, and another reminder that China's auto industry is strong, but not invincible. Let's dig in.
BYD Seagull Takes Over The World
This week, the U.S. government instituted some of its toughest moves yet to keep Chinese cars from pouring into the U.S. market. Officially, the bans that will go into effect later this decade are predicated on national security: keeping high-tech, connected, camera-equipped cars from potentially spying or collecting sensitive data on citizens.
While U.S. Department of Commerce officials say the measures aren't related to any other anti-China policy actions, like the earlier tariffs, it's easy to see what's really going on here. And that's a plan to at the very least help the U.S. automakers (and ones operating here, like Toyota and the rest) to buy time to build cars that can compete with China.
That was the vibe on a panel yesterday at the Automotive News Congress in Detroit:
""This industry here in the United States should not think that this is going to be here forever,"" said John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, at the conference in Pontiac, Mich., a suburb of Detroit. ""Then the question is, what will we do with our time?""
The moves are aimed at addressing national security concerns and boosting the competitiveness of the North American auto industry in the face of the threat of imported, inexpensive Chinese EVs flooding the market.
They're unlikely to keep Chinese automakers out of the region for long, as companies such as BYD eye Mexico as a location to open an assembly plant, AutoForecast Solutions CEO Joe McCabe said. But they do give companies in the region the ability to become more competitive by building back brand loyalty and addressing issues such as range anxiety and the high cost of new EVs, he said.
""This gives us time for manufacturers to not be complacent,"" McCabe said. ""If you build here, get competitive.""
The North American auto industry cannot directly compete for long with the enormous subsidies Chinese automakers receive from China's government, but tariffs and federal incentives provide the region with an ""amazing buffer"" to create more products that can go toe-to-toe with them, said Kate Kalutkiewicz, senior managing director at McLarty Associates.
They're all correct here. China has a big lead on two things: batteries and software. The first is because countries like the U.S. spent decades outsourcing to China and China spent the same amount of time cornering the market on the entire battery supply chain. It's one huge reason why so many U.S. EVs are massive money-losers: no ownership of those battery costs. The country is also a leader in-car software, as its EV makers have fully committed to the ""software-defined vehicle"" strategy that Tesla pioneered. Couple those advantages with extremely cheap labor costs (and often questionable labor practices, to put it diplomatically) and you get a recipe for cars that can outclass and undercut ours by a significant margin.
But if these automakers are shut out of the U.S. for a few years, that in theory gives our car companies—and the country as a whole—time to build up the local supply chain, get better at making EVs and up their collective software game.
Now the big question is: Can they?
I've been wondering what's been happening with Hyundai's groundbreaking plan to sell cars (with the help of local dealers, of course) on Amazon. That was announced at last year's Los Angeles Auto Show, and save for a small pilot program only for Amazon employees, it hasn't seen much of a wider rollout.
Now we sort of know more, also thanks to an Automotive News Congress panel event:
Auto dealers are frustrated at the lack of progress in Hyundai's plans to sell its full portfolio of vehicles on the Amazon shopping platform, said Mike Stanton, CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
""Amazon announced this about a year ago and they're still not out of pilot,"" Stanton said at a Sept. 24 retail-focused panel discussion held at the Automotive News Congress in Pontiac, Mich. One of the main topics was direct-to-consumer versus dealership distribution models.
""What I am hearing right now is that the dealers are frustrated,"" Stanton said. ""They're not there yet with the agreement. It appears to be another digital retailing tool at the moment and probably not top tier.""
For example:
""When you look at our whole ecosystem of vendors that we work with ... we need these partners to make sure that we can deliver on that experience,"" Stanton said.
He said he believes Amazon understands the complexity of how the car-selling process works, but the partnership pilot still has a lot more work to go.
""They still haven't set up a situation where the dealer can deal with multiple banks or work on trades, so I think more will come,"" Stanton said.
We're working on learning more about this situation, but some of that makes sense. We anticipated some dealer resistance to the idea of online car-shopping, since some of them could see the move as laying the groundwork to eliminate them from the sales process. That would take major legal overhauls, however, since the car dealer franchise system is cemented into new car sales laws in many states.
Hyundai won't ever say this, but I get the sense the Amazon move happened over some frustration with the fact that it now makes world-class EVs but has a U.S. dealer network with a bit of a... reputation, let's just say. (All the time, we hear from prospective Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 buyers who encounter nightmare scenarios at car-buying time.) It sounds like both sides have things to figure out if this program is to move past the pilot stage.
China Dealer
Don't think the Chinese auto industry is some unstoppable juggernaut. After decades of explosive growth, the country's economy is slowing down and the huge field of car brands is starting to narrow. Here's Bloomberg on Chinese auto dealers feeling the sting:
Car dealerships across China are facing losses of almost $20 billion as consumers hold off on making major purchases and vehicles pile up in sales lots.
The country’s car retailers are experiencing “extremely intense liquidity” and looking at losses of about 138 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) for the first eight months of 2024 alone, the China Automobile Dealers Association said in a statement Monday.
While sales of new-energy vehicles in China are relatively strong, retail passenger car sales overall are more muted, expected to rise just 4% year-on-year in September, China’s Passenger Car Association said last week. Government subsidies encouraging drivers to trade in older cars are largely responsible for the NEV sales surge but dealerships are hurting due to the industry’s continued price war.
Instead, they're relying heavily on discounts to move metal, but inventory is still piling up. Sound familiar?
NIO ET7 customer deliveries kicked off in China on March 28
Let's say you're in charge of U.S. policy to help the auto industry—which, by the way, adds some $600 billion to our GDP and employs millions of people—keep up with China. What do you do? No wrong ideas here, let's brainstorm.

Nissan's Nismo Won't Go Fully Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/734968/nissan-nismo-fully-electric/,Chaotic EV growth has forced Nissan's performance brand to adjust.,12/25/2024 7:28,"If you've been worried that Nissan's high-performance Nismo division will be going fully electric, we have some good news. In a recent interview, Pierre Loing, Nissan's global product boss, said, ""Nismo has no specific target to go electric only.""
Loing told Top Gear magazine that EV growth has been chaotic, and ""our role as a manufacturer is to adjust."" The company is focusing on its E-Power powertrain, which uses the gasoline engine as a battery generator. Nissan launched the Qashqai E-Power in 2022, the first model to feature the new setup and any Nismo plans depend on the specific model. Over half of the Qashqai's sold in Europe have E-Power.
Nissan knows a car like the GT-R can command a far higher price for a Nismo offering than a model like the Ariya. Loing admits the Ariya isn't a cheap EV, so the price ceiling can't reach ""a super high level,"" which ultimately depends on the model. A Nismo package has to fit the product, and any expansion will need strong sales to justify its existence.
Automakers across the board are reconsidering their electric vehicle plans in the face of inconsistent growth. Many are tempering their ambitious roadmaps, pushing back EV launches while focusing on growing their hybrid lineups. It indicates how quickly consumer trends can change and how nimble automakers have had to adjust.
Loing said that if you'd asked him about the company's EV plans a few years ago, he would have ""given a different answer."" Hopefully, the next few years won't force the automaker to set a new timeline to fully electrify the Nismo line.

A $1 Billion Fund Aims To Revitalize America's EV Suppliers,https://insideevs.com/news/734860/one-billion-ev-fund-small-auto-suppliers/,A government-backed $1 billion fund hopes to help small auto suppliers embrace EVs.,9/23/2024 17:30,"As the U.S. prepares to move its electric vehicle supply-chain away from China with tariffs on Chinese-made EVs and a proposed ban on Chinese and Russian software and hardware, it's also boosting support for its homegrown EV supply-chain network.
Chicago-based investment firm Monroe Capital today announced plans to raise $1 billion to facilitate loans for small- and medium-sized auto suppliers. The White House lauded the announcement, saying the fund aims to help small auto businesses make the tough transition towards EVs.
The Drive Forward fund, as Monroe Capital calls it, would be a ""government-guaranteed"" scheme to help smaller suppliers embrace electrification and diversify their businesses away from gas cars.
""A focus will be placed on manufacturers that are well-positioned to lead in the future of the automotive industry and need additional capital and support to grow their manufacturing capacity,"" the White House said in a statement.
Auto suppliers have an outsized role in the transition towards electrification as they employ more than 250,000 workers across the country, including in Michigan, Ohio and other parts of the nation, the White House added.
They're the backbone of the shift to EVs but have struggled so far. They need to retrain their workforce, retool plants, navigate parts shortages and on top of all that, help automakers comply with tough new EPA emissions rules that will kickstart in 2027.
Without a financial shot in the arm from the government, it would be tough. The White House added that the support would go to ""companies making critical investments in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) production to electric vehicles (EV).""
This is in addition to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's $9.1 million grant to establish the Michigan Auto Supplier Transition Program to help the state's small businesses embrace EVs.
The announcements for local support for EVs comes in the wake of the Commerce Department's latest proposal to ban Chinese and Russian software in cars sold in the U.S. from 2027 and hardware from 2030.
The U.S. believes that software and hardware with links to China or Russia, such as vehicle connectivity systems, cellular and WiFi network and advanced driver assistance systems pose a national security risk.
If the ban is finalized, the prospect of Chinese EVs ever landing on U.S. shores would get even slimmer.

General Motors' CEO 'Surprised' EVs Have Become Political,https://insideevs.com/news/734720/mary-barra-politics-cm-election/,"Plus, Nissan discovers an exciting new technology called ""plug-in hybrids"" and there may be a silver lining to South Korea's EV fire scare.",9/23/2024 10:00,"Here in America, we invent all kinds of new and fantastic ways to get mad about the things we see on cable news. For approximately half the country, electric vehicles are one of those things. People are mad that they might be ""forced"" into buying EVs, and even if that's not actually the case, even the CEO of General Motors admits she's been caught off guard by the backlash.
GM CEO Mary Barra's latest comments on the EV race headline this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and auto industry news. We'll also look at Nissan's new plug-in hybrid plans and why South Korea's recent EV battery fire scare may even have an upside.
GM CEO Mary Barra with the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV
I have to hand it to Barra: I think she struck the right tone during an interview on CBS' Sunday Morning this past weekend. GM has actually been having a pretty good do-over year for EVs: it's been launching new models like the Equinox EV and several upcoming electric Cadillacs, all while preparing for the reboot of the Bolt EUV next year. And Tesla's Supercharger network just opened up to GM's EVs last week with the use of a new adapter.
But GM certainly hasn't been immune to the headwinds of the EV sector, mainly that sales haven't taken off as quickly as they and other automakers expected. (And increasingly, I wonder what it was they all seemed to expect.) Barra admitted earlier this year that GM won't hit a previous goal of 1 million EVs sold by 2025 and that it will delay several new models and factories as it waits for the market to ""develop.""
As disappointing as that is, Barra at least reaffirmed the overall goal on CBS:
But it was her promise three years ago to stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2035 – and GM's ability to live up to it – that will likely define her legacy.
Asked if she anticipates GM will be all-electric by 2035, Barra replied, ""For our light-duty vehicles, yes. We'll be guided by the consumer, but the plans that we have in place will get us there."" Nonetheless, in the face of slowing EV sales, Barra said, ""I don't think we ever thought it was gonna be linear.""
The ""light duty"" caveat, which has been used before, is interesting. GM seems to be as skeptical of the electric heavy-duty work truck as Ford is—and I'm fairly unconvinced on giant, 200 kWh batteries for trucks too—but that's just me reading the lines there.
But Barra's also in a tough spot because she's seeking to get more customers for very mainstream American brands like Chevrolet and GMC into EVs. I don't mean to generalize too much, but that's a very different customer base than Rivian or Tesla, and the politicization of EVs may be tougher for GM to navigate. It certainly caught Barra by surprise:
Barra was surprised that EVs have become a political issue: ""I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be,"" she said. ""Again, I think one of the strengths of General Motors is we're giving people choice. We're not telling you what you have to have. We're saying, if you want this, we have it.""
Then again, the Bolt EV and EUV were the top-selling U.S. EVs that weren't Teslas in 2023. If you build it, and it's cheap enough and good enough, they will come.

If you believe in an electrified future, there are reasons to be optimistic about GM these days. Less so for Nissan, which blew an early lead in the EV race to keep making anodyne-looking gas cars powered by engines that they were running when I was in high school. (Which was over 20 years ago, for context.)
While the staying power of the VQ35 family of V6 engines is certainly a master class in cost amortization, Nissan does feel quite behind the curve on its powertrain strategy. It sells one EV in the U.S. and no hybrids here. But it is planning to join GM in offering some plug-in hybrids in the back half of this decade, Nikkei Asia reports.
Like the rest of the auto industry in Japan, a country that struggles with scarce natural resources and has a challenged relationship with electricity generation, Nissan has lagged on cars with plugs. Even Toyota's PHEV sales are drop in the bucket compared to conventional hybrids. But Nissan may soon lean on partners at Mitsubishi to get properly in the PHEV game:
Nissan Motor plans to develop its own plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, preparing to reach the market as soon as the late 2020s, Nikkei has learned, and also is considering having partner company Mitsubishi Motors supply PHEVs to Honda Motor, which does not offer that type of vehicle in the Japanese market.
As sales of fully electric vehicles stall globally amid high prices, Nissan sees highly profitable PHEVs as an important bridge to the time EVs achieve wide adoption.
Sales are rising for PHEVs, which combine an electric motor with a conventional fuel-powered engine. General Motors also has begun to consider developing plug-in hybrids for the U.S. market.
Electric vehicles are broadly classified into EVs, PHEVs and hybrids. These environmentally friendly autos emit less carbon dioxide than cars powered solely by petrochemicals.
PHEVs have a longer driving range than EVs because they also carry an engine. Unlike hybrids, they can be charged from household electrical outlets. Despite offering the advantages of both technologies, Japanese PHEVs have been limited to a few models offered by Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Motors.
Then again, Nissan has made big promises on EVs before, and the late 2020s may as well be 500 years away considering how fast the tech market moves—and how far ahead China is all sorts of plug-in cars.
South Korea EV Fires
Meanwhile in South Korea, a country that is quite advanced at EVs, a recent spate of underground parking garage fires has buyers on edge. Sales of EVs are now plummeting there, while they had been on the rise before this.
However, the Korean government seems to be acting swiftly to reassure car buyers that EVs are safe, and it has enacted groundbreaking rules around battery sourcing transparency. Bloomberg's Heesu Lee, based in Seoul and an EV owner herself, manages to find an upside here:
With the investigation still underway and the cause of the Mercedes fire yet to be identified, some carmakers, including Hyundai, General Motors and Porsche have taken the matter into their own hands by voluntarily disclosing their battery suppliers and offering free safety inspections to EV owners.
The government has also pledged to strengthen safety measures in parking lots and require more EV makers and battery charging operators to have adequate insurance cover. Whether those measures are enough to calm the unease around EVs is yet to be seen. As for me, I’m content to keep driving my EV.
And the flip side of risk is opportunity. If South Korea pushes forward and ends up with effective and comprehensive regulations in place, it could be a chance for the country to build a more resilient environment for EVs in the future.
And it could serve as an example for the rest of the world.
2026 Chevrolet Bolt Rendered
If you're GM, how do you get past the knee-jerk anti-EV politics that are out there? I'll say it again: people want a good deal. Give them something really affordable and also means they'll never have to pay for gasoline again and just see how fast they lose any misconceptions.
It's just technology, folks. It doesn't need to get political.

The Electronics Company Sharp Wants To Sell Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/734364/sharp-wants-sell-cars-by-2030/,This electric minivan has solar panels and a 65-inch display.,12/25/2024 7:28,"Just when you thought the automotive industry couldn't possibly get more crowded, another player wants to enter the game. To make it happen, TV maker Sharp intends to work with Foxconn, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer. It's better known as one of the companies that produces the iPhone. Their first joint effort is this. Say hello to the cute LDK+.
It's an EV with an adorably boxy shape and some neat features inside and out. The people-mover started in life as Foxconn's Model C crossover before being transformed for minivan duty. Sharp made the most of that massive roof by fitting solar panels to juice up the battery or power your home. There's a separate ""storage battery” to further take advantage of bidirectional charging by serving as an energy supply in case of emergencies such as a power outage caused by a natural phenomenon.
The cavernous interior is big enough to accommodate a massive 65-inch screen and rear seats that swivel. Sharp says the LDK+ uses artificial intelligence that gathers information from home appliances to adjust the AC and screen brightness. That massive display mounted at the back is not just for play as it can be used for a mobile office.
Technical specifications remain shrouded in mystery at this point. However, we do know the 2021 concept has since evolved into a production model that's already on sale in Taiwan as the Foxtron Model C. If you're unfamiliar with the name, Foxtron is a joint venture between Luxgen's parent company Yulon and Foxconn.
The road-going SUV has 231 horsepower, 250 pound-feet of torque, and 314 miles of range, albeit in the overly optimistic New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) cycle. The EV is 184.8 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 64 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 115 inches. That said, Sharp's electric minivan has different proportions. As for weight, the Foxtron Model C tips the scales at around 4,300 pounds.
Automotive News spoke with a Sharp official about the company’s ambitions to enter the automotive realm. Kazuma Naito, software development manager at Sharp’s Next Innovation branch, said the objective is to start selling cars by 2030. He admitted that the timeframe is currently a ""loose goal.""
With Foxconn owning a 66% controlling stake in Sharp, it's no surprise the two will collaborate again to bring EVs to the market by the decade's end. In the first phase, Sharp wants to sell electric cars at home in Japan, built domestically or somewhere else by Foxconn, potentially in China.
Sharp won't be the only tech giant from the Land of the Rising Sun to enter the car business in recent years. Sony has teamed up with Honda to launch an automotive joint venture called Sony Honda Mobility to bring the Afeela electric sedan to the market in 2025. An SUV is set to follow in 2027, with a cheaper compact model believed to debut in 2028 at the earliest.
Speaking of tech companies making cars, the long-rumored Apple Car was canceled back in February. That's despite an investment of more than $10 billion (yes, with a ""b"") over a decade, according to a recent report from The New York Times.

Chinese EVs Can Undercut American EVs Even With Tariffs,https://insideevs.com/news/734298/cheaper-chinese-evs-cm-tariff/,We also discuss how fast wireless charging is moving forward and why Stellantis is facing heat from UAW.,9/18/2024 11:37,"The bitter trade war between China and the West means we’re missing out on cheap, well-built Chinese EVs in the U.S. But when you're at the top of your game, tariffs can only sting so much.
Despite the hefty 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric cars, some of them can still undercut American-made EVs on price if there were to ever land on our shores.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily dose of news shaping up the world of electric cars, software defined vehicles and autonomous tech. Also on today's agenda: wireless charging for electric cars is inching closer to commercial reality and Stellantis is facing some heat from United Auto Workers (UAW), which plans to hold a strike authorization vote soon.
The U.S. Trade Representative said last week that Biden's punitive tariffs on electric cars will finally go into effect on September 27. That's after several delays and looming uncertainty over the continuation of the current EV policies—tax breaks for buyers, incentives for local factories and so on—as the November election approaches.
The tariffs intend to shield domestic automakers from a potential flood of affordable, high-quality Chinese EVs. But a new report from Japanese outlet Nikkei Asia reminds us that the tariffs, no matter how punitive, still have some limitations.
Here's what the report says:
In the U.S, not even front-runner Tesla has broken into the sub-$30,000 price range. There are no American EVs as cheap as gasoline-powered vehicles yet.
Joe McCabe, CEO of U.S. research company AutoForecast Solutions, said BYD's lowest price in the U.S. is $12,000. Even with a 100% tariff, BYD will have the cheapest EV in the market at under $25,000.
They may not be American, but there are some EVs that start at under $30,000 in the U.S., like the Nissan Leaf which costs a shade above $28,000 before taxes and fees. But it's true that EVs in the U.S. still aren't cheap, not without tax credits, lease and financing offers or the used market anyway.
That reminds of me of the $12,000 BYD Seagull, a fashionable little hatchback rocking Blade batteries and features from cars a segment above. If it hit U.S. shores, it would cost twice as that—but still undercut the Tesla Model 3s and Chevy Bolt EVs.
Sure, it's no range monster with its 39 kWh battery pack covering only 251 miles on the overly optimistic China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). But at that price, it would still offer value to users that don't munch miles all that often.
In China, the Seagull is so popular it’s edging out gas cars and speeding up the country’s already impressive EV revolution. It's gaining respect even internationally, as it was Japan's 2023 EV Of The Year.
The whole point of the tariffs is to allow America's homegrown industries some breathing room to build a BYD Seagull of our own, made in American factories, using American batteries and components.
But according to the report above, China argues that the tariffs only disrupts the global supply chains and won't really help the U.S. become competitive where it needs to be. Not without teaming up with Chinese car and battery makers anyway.
WiTricity’s Tesla Model 3 demo vehicle with WiTricity Halo wireless charging system
Wireless charging can be a small ergonomic improvement for your home. Just like your smartphone, you can come home after work, align your EV on a wireless charging pad and declutter the garage with fewer cables.
To be clear, the plugs and cables are not going anywhere. In fact, Level 2 and Level 3 charging infrastructure is only poised to grow in the U.S. But automakers see a business case for wireless charging.
In August, the Society of Automotive Engineers established the standard J2954 for wireless pads. Now a new report says that the technology is nearing commercial viability, with huge improvements in power density, efficiency and weight reduction. Plus, the standard would ensure that it works uniformly across brands.
So how does this exactly work? Instead of plugging in, you park over a special charging pad embedded in the ground. This pad transfers electricity to a receiver on the car using magnetic fields—a process called inductive charging.
When the car is aligned with the pad, the magnetic field is picked up by the car’s battery without cables. It's convenient because you don’t have to manually connect anything, but it’s generally slower than plugging in.
Here's more from Automotive News:
The J2954 standard, covering software and hardware, is based on technology developed by German supplier Mahle.
The company's Differential Inductive Positioning System uses a low-intensity magnetic field generated from coils in the ground charging pad that is picked up by coils in the charging equipment on the vehicle.
The system carries out a test to ensure the vehicle is aligned. SAE's Wireless Power Transfer team said the standard has demonstrated wireless charging up to 11 kW with 93 percent efficiency.
There's a lot of quiet development happening in this space. Volkswagen has already tested wireless charging on a Porsche Taycan. Tesla has already equipped the Cybertruck with a connector and a harness for an ""inductive charger."" And Hyundai and wireless charging company Witricity have been running tests in Korea.
There would be some obvious challenges, like making them durable and affordable. But it's pretty clear that this is not some classroom science project. The way things are moving, we could see this become a reality at some point in the future.
The UAW is threatening a potentially disruptive strike against Stellantis. The union plans to hold a strike authorization vote in the coming days, against what it call the automaker's failure to keep up with the industry and its own commitments made last year after a historic walkout.
As Reuters reported today, local Stellantis chapters have submitted grievances against Stellantis' alleged plan to move production of the Dodge Durango abroad—something the automaker has not confirmed yet.
The union also highlighted the Belvidere, Illinois assembly plant. The automaker closed that factory last year, leading to 1,200 workers losing their jobs. Stellantis committed to spending $1.5 billion to re-open the plant following negotiations with the UAW.
""It's not every day that we the auto workers are on the same side as the dealers, the same side as the suppliers and the same side as the shareholders,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. ""But today is that day, and we are prepared to take strike action to make Stellantis keep the promise.""
WiTricity’s Tesla Model 3 demo vehicle with WiTricity Halo wireless charging system
There's only one way to refuel a gas car: pull up, pump, and go. But the EV charging industry is still relatively young. It's still evolving, with no one-size-fits-all solution. That’s why the industry keeps innovating to make charging faster and hassle-free.
If wireless charging takes off, would you make the switch? Why do you think it might be better (or worse?) than your trusty Level 2 home charger? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Californians Are ‘Ashamed’ To Drive Teslas,https://insideevs.com/news/733956/tesla-sales-drop-in-silicon-valley/,"The Silicon Valley region once witnessed the highest adoption of Teslas. Now, people there are moving away from the brand.",9/16/2024 11:30,"Tesla sales and market share have declined for consecutive quarters this year and that trend is also reflecting certain parts of California, where Teslas have been historically popular, the most recent vehicle registration data suggests.
The first and second wave of Tesla buyers, especially in the Silicon Valley region, weren't just drawn to the brand's cool factor, but also its tech-forwardness and climate-conscious appeal. Now, experts suggest that rising competition and CEO Elon Musk’s shift toward far-right politics might be a drag on the brand.
Once Tesla's stronghold and the birthplace of its success, the region was a proving ground for a brand that made Musk the world’s richest man and accelerated the global shift to EVs. But now, Musk is undermining that very brand, tarnishing the empire he built.
According to S&P Mobility, Tesla registrations fell 22% between January and July in Santa Clara county, the heart of Silicon Valley. Meanwhile rivals saw 41% growth. Tesla alternatives have been soaring in popularity recently. Nationally, non-Tesla EV sales are up 33% in the first six months of this year, as per InsideEVs’ analysis of Cox Automotive data.
While the sales of Tesla's volume-sellers like the Model 3 and Model Y seem to be declining, the Cybertruck's production has ramped up significantly and it's now the best-selling electric truck in the U.S.
""It's unquestionable that this cloud of behavior has affected the brand,"" Mario Natarelli, managing partner at branding agency MBLM told Automotive News. ""Tesla was the EV leader, the most innovative, represented by a visionary… Now people are selling their Teslas, ashamed to even drive them because of the association with him.”
The list of Musk's controversies is endless. But here are some of the latest.
After the second assassination attempt on Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump yesterday, Musk questioned why there were no similar assassination attempts on President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris. After facing backlash, he deleted that post on X.
Musk is also donating $45 million per month to a pro-Trump Super PAC. In an interview with Trump last month, he said things like, “we shouldn’t vilify the oil and gas industry.” In the 24 hours after his interview with Trump, he tweeted 145 times, posting anti-immigrant content, election conspiracies and attacks against the media.
Data analytics firm CivicScience said that might be hurting the brand in a significant way.
In a survey of nearly 1,200 respondents familiar with Musk and Tesla, the majority of them said they were sensitive to a brand’s stance on social and political causes and were ‘somewhat’ likely to boycott a company based on the political leanings of its leader. However, those serious about buying Teslas are less affected.
“While Musk’s political stance could alienate new EV buyers in a tough market, those who are more serious about a Tesla purchase appear less likely to be concerned,” the report said.
The study adds that Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to purchase an EV. But despite the huge discounts on Teslas and insane lease and financing offers on the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla’s favorability reached an all time low of 18% in July among U.S. adults who lean liberal/Democrat.
Even among Republicans, Tesla’s favorability dropped from 36% in January to 18% in May, but rebounded slightly to 22% by July.
Tesla was still the EV market leader in California between January and July 2024, accounting for 56% of the market. But that’s a big drop from its 64% share during the same period last year. In the second quarter of this year, Tesla’s market share in the U.S. slipped to 49.7%, from 59.3% a year earlier, Cox Automotive data suggests.
Now, Tesla is shifting its focus from cars to artificial intelligence and robotics. The company’s robotaxi reveal is set for October 10 and Musk claims that the robotaxi business, along with sales of humanoid robots, could catapult its valuation into the trillions.
Whether that vision becomes reality is anyone’s guess, but one thing is clear: Tesla’s decline is proving more sustained than once anticipated.

'Existential Threat': How China Forced Ford To Get Serious On EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/733777/ford-china-evs-wsj/,Ford's recent decision to push back new EVs is seen as a retreat. But maybe it's a regrouping and reloading instead. Can it work in time?,9/15/2024 10:22,"There are two prevailing ways to look at Ford's recent decision to cancel an electric three-row SUV, delay an electric pickup and focus more on hybrids in the immediate term. The more cynical surface read is that Ford is conceding, as many headlines have put it, that ""EVs just aren't working out"" and that hybrids will be a better fit for American buyers anyway.
The other way to read this move is to admit that there are bigger forces at work than just what we see on American roads, and Ford isn't abandoning EVs at all—only giving itself more time and effort to come up with electric options that are truly competitive with the stuff we see coming out of China lately. And that tariffs on Chinese-made EVs will hold them at bay in our market until Ford can deliver more advanced and hopefully profitable EVs in the back half of this decade.
I hope for Ford's sake that it's the second one. But it's still a bold and dangerous bet with no guaranteed chance of success.
I do think Ford understands the stakes, and the statements by CEO Jim Farley and other Ford executives in a recent Wall Street Journal story help drive that home. After all, Farley seems to get how much Ford—as well as General Motors and the remaining Chrysler brands—have lost market share to so-called foreign competitors since their heyday in the 1960s. “I’ve seen this movie before"" is how Farley describes potential competition from China in that story; the whole American auto industry once scoffed at the likes of Toyota and Hyundai. And look where that got them.
The WSJ story is worth a read in full, but it describes the wake-up call Ford got over a series of visits to China in the past 18 months. Here's how Farley broke the news to a board member after one such trip:
In an early-morning call with fellow board member John Thornton, an exasperated Farley unloaded.
The Chinese carmakers are moving at light speed, he told Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who spent years as a senior banker in China. They are using artificial intelligence and other tech in cars that is unlike anything available in the U.S. These Chinese EV makers are using a low-cost supply base to undercut the competition on price, offering slick digital features and aggressively expanding to overseas markets.
“John, this is an existential threat,” Farley said.
Presumably during that same visit, Farley—who's as much a true ""car guy"" as any top executive in the industry and can genuinely handle himself on a race course—got to taste the local flavor for himself. And that was the kind of ""a-ha"" moment that no CEO wants to get about the competition:
In early 2023, Farley made his first trip to China since it reopened after years of pandemic restrictions. He sat in the driver seat of an electric SUV from Ford’s longtime joint-venture partner, Changan Automobile, which for years had been a middling player in China, its market share hovering around 5%.
Farley, who races vintage cars and has an encyclopedic knowledge of car models, thrashed the EV around Changan’s sprawling test track in central China, as Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler rode shotgun. Afterward the executives sat silently, stunned at the progress Changan had made. The ride was smooth and quiet and the cabin upscale, with easy-to-use technology.
“Jim, this is nothing like before,” Lawler told Farley after the drive. “These guys are ahead of us.”
Ford certainly deserves credit for being first to market with the first all-electric pickup truck and bold experiments like the Mustang Mach-E. Those moves have made Ford the top-selling single brand for EVs behind Tesla (although lately, the Hyundai Motor Group has surpassed it in EV sales when all three of its brands are counted together.)
It's also shown a penchant for outside-the-box tactics to entice people into its EVs, like being the first to offer access to Tesla's Supercharger network and kicking off the NACS revolution here in America.
Ford's now-cancelled three-row electric SUV.
But Ford's EVs are getting crushed on costs. They still aren't profitable and the EV division, which Ford breaks out separately from its gas car and commercial units, will probably eat about half of its projected operating profit this year.
That's to be expected as any automaker ramps up its EV and battery supply chain, something that's largely very different from gas cars. But Wall Street isn't necessarily giving Ford the pass it wanted there. And with EVs, the most important component is the most expensive one: the battery. China still owns that supply chain almost completely. While America is making moves to catch up—thanks in large part to incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act—China's head start is massive. Furthermore, the intense ""survival of the fittest"" competition among automakers within China has driven incredible advancements in cost reduction.
In other words, it's clear that as good as the Mach-E and Lightning are, they're first-draft attempts at EVs that just won't cut on the international markets or if Chinese EVs come to America. “Executing to a Chinese standard is going to be the most important priority,” Farley is quoted as saying in the story.
Ford F-150 Lightning at a Tesla Supercharging station
That story also says the CEO sees Chinese EVs as ""an immediate threat in Europe and other overseas markets, and a long-term risk in Ford’s profit engine of North America, regardless of protectionist measures."" I do agree with that; anyone who says ""well, Chinese cars can't come here because of the tariffs"" needs to start thinking more than five minutes into the future.
Or five years, more realistically. As the Chinese automakers scale up in Mexico, it feels like fending them off forever with just tariffs and regulations will be an impossible task.
The story closes with Farley and Doug Field, an Apple and Tesla veteran who leads EV and tech efforts at Ford, scratching their heads on how to cut $800 in cost out of an electric prototype without making the car, in their words, ""really shitty.""
That's what China's automakers have already figured out. Ford hopes to get there eventually too. But it's now a race against time to do it.

GM And Hyundai Join Forces To Boost EV Development,https://insideevs.com/news/733501/gm-hundai-agreement-ev-development/,The two automakers signed a memorandum of understanding today.,9/12/2024 7:39,"General Motors and Hyundai Motor Company will explore a slew of collaboration opportunities including co-developing future electric, hydrogen and internal combustion vehicles.
According to the memorandum of understanding that was signed today, the two entities will also look into combining forces to source battery raw materials, steel and others.
It's worth noting that the framework agreement involves GM, which owns several car brands, and Hyundai the individual marque, not Hyundai Motor Group which owns Hyundai, Kia and Genesis. However, the non-binding agreement was signed by GM’s CEO Mary Barra and Hyundai Motor Group’s Executive Chair Euisun Chung.

The two automakers said they will look for ways to leverage their complementary scale and strengths to reduce costs and bring a wider range of vehicles and technologies to customers faster. In other words, they'll work together to share technologies and know-how to potentially bring cheaper cars, including EVs, to the market.
While this agreement is non-binding, meaning they can bail out of the deal, the two companies said work on binding agreements “will begin immediately.”
“GM and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams. Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently,” said Barra.
Top officials from General Motors and Hyundai Motor Company after the two companies signed a memorandum of understanding
It's an interesting and unexpected collaboration between two car manufacturers that are already investing heavily in next-generation electric vehicles that are bound to lower the entry price for potential customers who are not necessarily overly enthusiastic about getting an EV.
The big wave of people who always wanted an EV, even if that meant a higher-than-average price, is reportedly over. Now we need cheaper cars to get the next wave of people interested, and this deal might just help with that.
General Motors’s Ultium woes are behind and the company is chugging along with the launch of several new battery-powered models. At the same time, Hyundai has pledged to continue investing in green vehicles and has seen record sales numbers thanks in no small part to its portfolio of EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids. With the two joining forces, the result might be very, very interesting.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tesla Model 3 Prices Dropping Like A ‘Lead Balloon,’ Says Study",https://insideevs.com/news/733279/tesla-model-3-used-ev-prices-dropping/,"Used EV prices dropped six times faster than gas cars. Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt EV top that list.",9/10/2024 17:27,"We've been watching this unfold over the past year: electric cars depreciating much faster than their gasoline and hybrid counterparts. This trend came on the heels of Tesla's rapid-fire price cuts last year, and it sparked a price shift that's both exciting and concerning. But let's focus on the upside for now. Lower resale values on EVs mean you can snag a high-tech, modern used electric car for less than the average price of a used hybrid or gas vehicle.
Model Y Price Drop
That’s a win for your bank account and a win for the environment.
Automotive research firm iSeeCars published a study this week explaining the dynamics of the used EV market in the U.S. The study said that prices of cars like the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Niro EV have dropped six times faster than gas cars over the past 12 months.
For starters, used EVs have lost 24.7% of their value since September 2023, compared to 6% for used hybrids and 4.4% for used gas cars. That’s according to a dataset that included 1.6 million one to five-year-old used cars sold between August 2023 and 2024.
“The substantial drop in EV prices over the past year appears to have brought them in line with demand, with used EV days-on-market much lower today, reflecting a faster selling rate compared to a year ago,” Karl Brauer, iSeeCars Executive Analyst said. In short, affordability is driving sales.
Brauer added that the price drops we're seeing now aren't quite as drastic as before. Used EV prices were dropping by 30-40% at the end of 2023 and the start of 2024. The 25% indicates things are leveling off a bit. The average cost of a used EV is now $27,000. It’s expected to stabilize at around $25,000—a price tag many automakers are attempting to hit with their next-generation models.
This has led to used EVs being on the market for an average of 55.3 days in September 2023 to just 38.6 days now. That means used gas cars, hybrids and EVs now take the same amount of time to sell.
The study also added that demand for hybrids remains robust, with fewer fluctuations and price drops like EVs. Used hybrid prices are down just 6% over the past year, whereas used EV prices are down a whopping 24.7% as mentioned.
“People waiting for a good deal on a used electric car have been rewarded for their patience,” Brauer said. “If you bought a used EV a year ago you probably bought too soon, but at today’s prices a used EV is starting to make sense—assuming your lifestyle and vehicle needs line up with the benefits and limitations of an EV.”
So which models are headlining this trend? The average price of a Tesla Model 3 is now about $26,000, over $8,500 less than a year before. The average price of a Kia Niro EV is roughly $22,000, about $6,000 less than last year. The humble Nissan Leaf now costs $16,000, about $4,000 less than 12 months ago. Other notable low-cost used options include the Chevy Bolt EV and the Jaguar I-Pace.
That’s great for the new wave of mass adopters, so long as they’re willing to accept used models.
The Model 3 especially makes sense. Even the versions that arrived before the Highland remain relevant today. It benefits from the vast Supercharger network, has trims that can cover over 300 miles on a single charge and it keeps improving over time with software updates.
If Tesla and CEO Elon Musk don’t rock your boat with their cultural shenanigans and pivot away from cars, the Model 3 remains a great bargain. If they do, you have plenty of other great options to consider. Either way, if you’re in the market for a used EV, there’s never been a better time.

Mercedes Isn't Retreating From China. Its Doubling Down,https://insideevs.com/news/732707/mercedes-benz-china-investment-2025/,The brand is investing $2 Billion into cars that are meant to take on China's homegrown EV startups.,9/7/2024 12:00,"Like Volvo, Volkswagen, GM and Ford, Mercedes-Benz has openly walked back its EV future plans. The lozenge-shaped EQ cars are as good as dead, as is the MB.EA EV-specific architecture originally planned to replace the EQE and EQS when they reached the end of their model cycles. Still, despite all that grim news about Mercedes-Benz’s EV future, there are reports coming out of China that Mercedes-Benz is still putting a lot more money into making EVs work, at least in China. Mercedes-Benz is expected to put more than $2 Billion of investment in China to fight against China’s homegrown EV startups like Xpeng, Li Auto and Zeekr, according to local sources like CarNewsChina and CNEVPost.
The $2 billion is cut in two ways: $1.4 billion will reportedly go toward passenger vehicle operations, while the remaining $550 million will be put into Mercedes' commercial vehicle operations. The cars themselves will be produced by Mercedes-Benz’s existing joint venture operations with BAIC (passenger vehicles), and Fujian Benz (commercial vehicles), with the first fruits of the investment coming off production lines next year.
The Mercedes CLA Concept from 2023.
The first full EV will be the localized version of the electric CLA class. We already know that the new CLA will be based on the new MMA platform, but China’s version will be a localized long-wheelbase version explicitly for that market.
Most of Mercedes-Benz’s push and hope for its future is based on its ability to craft localized products that are compelling to Chinese buyers. It plans on introducing a specially crafted (ICE-powered) long-wheelbase GLE SUV just for China, as well as a luxury EV MPV meant to do battle with options from Zeekr, Voyah and Buick. This VAN.EA platform is expected to underpin all of Mercedes-Benz’s future EV van commercial vehicles and be made by its Chinese JV partner, Fujian Benz.
This is uncharted waters for most brands, especially luxury ones like Mercedes-Benz. For a long time, “BBA”, also known as Benz-BMW-Audi, had been somewhat insulated from China’s market changes, still turning consistent sales and strong profits. Now, that’s not the case. As China’s market continues to shift to full electrification, Mercedes-Benz’s EV efforts have not resonated with Chinese buyers while its ICE offerings continue to lose relevance. Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said it best; “There are no more cheques coming from China,” alluding to Western automakers' falling profits in China.
It seems like so many Western brands are at a crossroads in China. Are they to continue to invest and hope it pays off? Or do they cut and run? Mercedes-Benz isn’t the only German brand to invest even deeper in China. Volkswagen’s partnership with Xpeng is designed to right the ship and get the brand back on course in the country.
But these deeper partnerships don’t always work. Mitsubishi once was a prominent supplier of engines in many Chinese ICE cars during the 1990s and 2000s, but its lackluster ICE products never resonated all that deeply with Chinese consumers. When the market shifted to EVs and PHEVs, it tried its hand at selling reworked GAC motor products (the Eupheme EV/PHEV and Airtrek), but it wasn’t enough to boost the brand’s lagging sales. Mitsubishi stopped producing cars in China in late 2023, effectively ending its nearly 30-year run in the country.
Will Mercedes-Benz’s investment pay off? We’ll just have to wait and see.

Zeekr Increasingly Feels Like A Polestar Do-Over,https://insideevs.com/news/731929/zeekr-polestar-geely-cm/,"As Polestar falters, this Geely-backed EV company is one to watch. Plus: Hyundai's Genesis needs hybrids to grow.",8/30/2024 9:49,"It's got a sport sedan. It's got a crossover. It's even got a robotaxi you'll soon see on U.S. roads. So not only does China's Zeekr brand—part of the Geely Group conglomerate that also owns Volvo, Lotus and more—feel like one of the most direct shots at Tesla yet, but more and more, it feels like what Geely actually wanted to do with Polestar.
It's a slow news day on the mobility and tech front ahead of Labor Day in the U.S., but Critical Materials still has you covered. Also on tap this Friday: why Genesis needs hybrids more than other brands do right now, and why it's due to premier the newest and best of what the Hyundai Motor Group is cooking up.
Zeekr 7X
We like to try to be ahead of the curve here at InsideEVs. And all year, our man Kevin Williams has been telling you that Geely's Zeekr brand is one to watch. Not long after he was pretty impressed by its offerings in China, Zeekr even got listed on the New York Stock Exchange and inked a deal with Google's Waymo to supply its next-generation robotaxis even on American roads.
Clearly, Geely has big plans for Zeekr. And I'd argue that its latest debut, the Zeekr 7X crossover, is the biggest deal yet. Here's CNBC on what to expect:
Electric vehicle company Zeekr announced Friday that it would launch its first SUV in China next month, undercutting Tesla’s Model Y pricing in the country by over $1,400.
The Zeekr 7X, priced at 239,900 yuan ($33, 829), is the Chinese EV maker’s first midsize electric SUV and will be launched on Sept. 20.
It’s the latest Chinese EV to take on Tesla’s Model Y, which has also been challenged by Xpeng and Nio. Zeekr plans to deliver the 7X globally by the end of this year. It said the launch was targeted at global markets but did not specify the regions.
The five-seater Zeekr 7X SUV comes with two battery options that allow users to drive between 605 kilometers and 780 kilometers (about 376 to 485 miles) on a single charge. Developed by Zeekr’s engineers, the lithium-ion phosphate batteries take 10.5 minutes to charge by 75%, the company said.
Zeekr has said in the past that its latest batteries offer the fastest charge in the world, beating that of Tesla’s.
That story says global markets haven't been announced, but it's basically a lock to enter Europe in 2025—where it's also considering local production to duck tariffs.
So between the huge lineup, the advanced tech, the robotaxi, the clear aim at Western buyers and Tesla's dominance, this whole playbook feels like what Geely aimed to do a decade ago with Polestar—but ultimately faltered.
As our Rob Stumpf wrote yesterday, much of Polestar merely cannibalized designs from Volvo, leaving the latter brand pretty devoid of EVs. And Polestar's strategy got hammered by the increase in protective anti-China tariffs all over the world.
So Zeekr could be Polestar 2.0, with the fresh, new product that brand never had, and a better understanding of the modern rules of engagement around EVs from China. Tariffs are what they are, but if I had to put money on it, I'd say we'll see them for sale in America someday.
Polestar 4 premiere in Spain
I don't mean all of this to dog on Polestar. I actually like Polestar. When shopping for an EV earlier this summer, a Polestar 2 was our runner-up choice; the Polestar 3 crossover looks extremely promising; and I have this weird affinity for the Polestar 4 after sitting in one in New York. I kind of want one someday.
But that can only happen if the brand survives long enough. Right now, things look dark. It replaced its founding CEO with an industry veteran this week, albeit one with more experience running brands on the decline than on the rise. And though sales were up more than 80% this past quarter, the company's results continue to be not great. From Bloomberg:
The Swedish manufacturer reported a $242.3 million operating loss for the second quarter, although this was slightly narrower than the corresponding three-month period last year. Revenue dropped 17% to $574.9 million due to “lower global volumes and higher discounts,” Polestar said Thursday.
Once a vanguard of the electric-car movement, Polestar is grappling with high costs and increasing competition from new players, including from China. At the same time, consumer demand for EVs is waning amid high inflation and the end of subsidies in key markets, forcing some carmakers to offer discounts. Polestar’s share price has plunged by more than 90% since spinning out of Volvo Car AB two years ago.
Polestar expects more growth soon from the 3 and 4 going on sale. Can those two models reverse its fortunes?
Genesis Neolun Concept
Hyundai gave us a lot of future-facing news this week, including plans for more hybrids and an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) platform. But I was surprised at the lack of Genesis-specific announcements during that event in Seoul; often, automakers use investor-facing presentations to really hype up their luxury brands.
And the Korean giant clearly has big plans for Genesis beyond ""fancy Hyundais."" That includes the Genesis GV90, previewed by the Neolun concept seen above, and now more hybrid models too as it aims to accelerate its growth and compete more evenly with big names like Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.
Here's Automotive News:
Consumer demand for conventional gasoline-electric hybrids has increased this year as EVs remain unaffordable to most mainstream consumers, and the build-out of the EV charging infrastructure has been slow going.
""Customers who live in Los Angeles or the smile states, where there's more charging infrastructure, are embracing electric vehicles. But if they're in the middle of the country, for example, a hybrid is more their speed,"" Ash Corson, director of product planning for Genesis, told Automotive News.
Corson's group has been working closely with dealers so the brand can bring the ""the right product at the right time in the right place.""
Adding hybrids is part of that plan, he said.
[...] Genesis' current global goal is to eliminate sales of new gasoline-powered models by 2025 on the path to becoming all electric by 2030.
A Genesis spokesperson said they are not making changes to its commitments ""for the time being.""
One analyst quoted in that story speculates that perhaps the next evolution of Hyundai's E-GMP platform could accommodate hybrid power as well. Maybe adding a gas engine to that could be the EREV that Hyundai is planning? I expect we'll learn more next year.
Zeekr 7X
That Zeekr 7X looks like a real contender. So does this brand have the juice, and would you consider one if it was available in your market?

Polestar Gets A New CEO. Can He Turn Things Around?,https://insideevs.com/news/731640/polestar-ceo-xpeng-vw-cm/,"Volvo's troubled electric ""spinoff"" gets a new boss. Plus: Volkswagen gets tighter with China's Xpeng and BYD keeps the profits coming.",8/28/2024 10:21,"Let's hop in the DeLorean (an electric-converted one, naturally) and head way back in time to the distant past—the year 2021. Back then, interest rates were low, free money was cheap and every automaker looked at Tesla's sky-high valuations and said ""How hard can it be?"" That's the year Volvo parent company Geely Group began to go public with Polestar, which had turned from a performance label within Volvo to a standalone car brand four years prior. For a time, the future for Polestar seemed bright.
Except that it kind of hasn't been. Dogged for a long time by having just one EV in its lineup—a sedan in an SUV world—as well as slowing sales, production delays, trouble with tariffs, an unclear differentiation from Volvo and other problems, Polestar is replacing its founding CEO. Can the new guy, an industry veteran, turn things around for this troubled brand?
That kicks off today's Critical Materials, our morning roundup of must-read news about tech and mobility. Also on deck: Volkswagen gets even closer with Chinese partner Xpeng, and BYD brings the profits.
First customer deliveries of Polestar 3: Polestar’s headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden—June 27, 2024
My colleague Iulian Dnistran broke down the surprise resignation of Polestar's founding CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, and in that story he also outlined some of the many problems facing that brand. Ingenlath was a designer by trade and brought us, among other things, the Polestar 1 and Polestar 2.
The new boss is Michael Lohscheller, a business guy through and through. He started his automotive career at what was then called DaimlerChrysler and had stints at Mitsubishi and Volkswagen before taking the top job at then-European General Motors subsidiary Opel. When Opel became part of Stellantis in 2021, he did what everybody at Stellantis seems to do and got the hell out.
Given his extensive background, I think he deserves a bit more credit than the CEO roles at his last two gigs: Vietnam's VinFast, where he lasted about six months, and then leading troubled hydrogen truck startup Nikola.
I think Polestar is a vastly more legitimate enterprise than either of those companies, especially with the backing of Geely, which seems very serious about global expansion. But Lohscheller has a lot to figure out. Bloomberg explains:
Backed by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu, Polestar has struggled with delays in rolling out new models, while competition has been especially intense in China, a market it targeted for growth. The EV manufacturer has lost about 90% of its value since spinning out of Volvo Car AB two years ago.
Ingenlath’s tenure has been marked by management upheaval, disappointing sales, and the threat of losing the company’s US stock-market listing after failing to produce financial reports on time. His departure follows a broader reshuffle in June, as former Volkswagen executive Winfried Vahland was tapped to replace chairman Hakan Samuelsson.
There are some bright spots for Polestar, of course. The Polestar 2 may be getting a bit long in the tooth but it remains one of our favorite EVs on sale. The U.S.-built Polestar 3 SUV should help the brand get mainstream success the 2 sedans could not deliver, and the Polestar 4 seems like a unique and compelling option in a field where EVs don't always stand out.
But it's still got costs to get under control, a long-term strategy to launch, a ""we're not Volvo"" brand problem to sort out and car production that's both scattered across the globe and still largely dependent on Volvo in many places. Lohscheller had better be up for the task.
VW Xpeng Architecture
You'll hear more news from us today about China's Xpeng. But among other things, the rapidly rising automaker has a lot to teach new partner Volkswagen, which has also struggled with the software and tech side of the EV transition.
More than that, VW didn't count on getting hammered as badly as it has been in China. Sales of all its brands in that all-important market are falling fast. So just as VW is turning to Rivian for electrical architecture help here, it's partnering with Xpeng for China's next-gen EVs.
And CNBC reports that this is not exactly a partnership of equals in terms of know-how:
Hundreds of Volkswagen staff are spending time at Xpeng as the German auto giant and Chinese startup work to create electric cars for China, Xpeng co-president Brian Gu told CNBC on Monday.
He also said the partnership will help Xpeng’s global ambitions.
Volkswagen in July 2023 announced a $700 million investment into Xpeng to jointly develop two electric cars for delivery in China in 2026. The vehicles will be based on the platform for Xpeng’s G9, a midsize electric crossover SUV.
The German company’s workers are spending more time at Xpeng’s offices than the startup’s are at Volkswagen’s, Gu said. They are learning about the startup’s technology.
[...] Gu emphasized the forthcoming vehicles will be “very different” from those that currently sold by Xpeng or Volkswagen. He said the cars would likely have “better range, charging, much smarter driving, more feature luxury technology, for the same price, potentially.”
China learned to make cars through joint ventures with Western and other Asian automakers. Clearly, the roles have reversed now that the EV revolution is underway.
BYD Lineup 2024
Meanwhile, as countless other automakers slow their EV plans, BYD is still crushing it—even amid an economic downturn in its native China. And it's only just now starting its big expansions into Europe and Mexico; we've only seen the tip of that iceberg.
Here's another from Reuters on BYD's strong returns in Q2:
BYD's net profit hit 9.1 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in the April-June quarter, up 32.8% from a year earlier and its fastest growth since end-2023, while revenue grew 25.9% to 176.2 billion yuan, it said in a stock exchange filing.
Sales of autos and related products accounted for 75.8% of BYD's overall revenue and their gross margin rose to 23.9% in the first half of 2024, up 3.3 percentage points from the same period last year.
Gross margin fell to 18.69% in the second quarter from 21.88% the first quarter, per Reuters' calculations based on its fiscal disclosure.
BYD has taken a significant lead in the Chinese electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sector, leveraging its vertical integration strategy by using key components such as batteries made by the company.
And as the rest figure out how to make EVs more affordable, I will just add this:
""For vehicles priced (in China) under 150,000 yuan ($21,046), BYD holds absolute pricing power because, aside from glass and tires, it manufactures almost everything in-house,"" said Rosalie Chen, analyst at Third Bridge.
Over half of the cars sold in China are priced under $21,000.
That's why all the others had better get serious about this stuff soon.
Polestar 4 In New York
If you were in Lohscheller's shoes today, how would you approach these challenges? What would you do to make Polestar a ""leader in the premium electric vehicle market,"" as the company puts it?
And does Polestar have what it takes to go the distance as a standalone brand, or could we see it fold back into Volvo—or Zeekr?

Hyundai Ioniq 9 Three-Row SUV To Be Built In America; 560-Mile 'EREV' In 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/731616/hyundai-investor-day-ioniq-9/,"At Hyundai's CEO Investor Day event, big plans to speed up on EVs—and a ""bridge"" vehicle that drives like an EV but packs a gas engine too.",8/28/2024 8:22,"Yet again, as other automakers begin to slow down on electric vehicles, Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is stepping on the accelerator. At the automaker's annual CEO Investor Day event in Seoul, senior leaders announced their strategy over the next few years, keeping a goal to sell 2 million EVs per year globally by 2030 but adding more hybrids into the mix—including a long-rumored new type of vehicle that may serve as the ultimate ""bridge"" between internal combustion and electric power.
Hyundai Motor President and CEO Jae Hoon Chang also announced big plans for the U.S. market, and for U.S. jobs: the upcoming new Hyundai Ioniq 9 electric three-row SUV will be built at the new Metaplant in Georgia, joining the familiar Ioniq 5 expected to start production there later this year.
In doing so, Chang also reaffirmed the name of the new SUV, which was previously called the Hyundai Ioniq 7. Unveiled as the Hyundai Seven Concept in 2021, the production version is expected to be seen at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this year.
""Hyundai Motor is making significant strides in its quest to become a global top-tier player in the EV market,"" Chang said in prepared remarks. ""As the only global automaker with a full battery system lineup, Hyundai Motor is dedicated not only to improving battery performance but also to ensuring that EVs are affordable, safe and easy to maintain.""
Georgia production of the Ioniq 9 had been expected, especially given the success of the similar Kia EV9 three-row crossover in America—which is also now built in the U.S. The Metaplant factory in Bryan County near Savannah is due to produce up to 300,000 vehicles per year while bringing thousands of jobs to the area, company officials have said. Building the Ioniq 9 here should qualify the car for U.S. EV tax credits of some sort.
In addition, with Ford now pivoting to a hybrid setup for its previously all-electric three-row SUV, Hyundai and Kia may get an even bigger lock on the mainstream three-row EV segment—for now, at least.
But even as it kept in place that aggressive global EV sales target, Hyundai officials admitted that the path to an electric future has been slower and less even than expected. As such, Chang confirmed that the automaker will step into EREVs—short for ""Extended Range Electric Vehicle.""
A modern take on the concept pioneered by the BMW i3 and Chevrolet Volt, an EREV is essentially a battery-powered EV that also packs a gas engine, but only as a generator to recharge that battery pack. The gas engine does not drive the wheels.
""The new EREV will combine the advantages of internal combustion engines and EVs,"" Chang said. ""Hyundai Motor has developed a unique new powertrain and power electronics system to enable four-wheel drive with the application of two motors. The operation is powered solely by electricity, similar to EVs, with the engine being used only for battery charging.""
In addition, that EREV model will be built in North America (the automaker did not disclose exactly where) and China in 2026, Chang said. They will debut as SUVs from Hyundai and the Genesis luxury brand with a target of 80,000 units per year on this continent. At least some models will offer ""refueling and stress-free charging"" with a range of over 900 km, or 560 miles, when fully charged.
""It provides EREV customers with a responsive EV-like driving experience, allowing consumers to naturally transition to EVs during future demand recovery periods,"" Chang said. From 2030 onward, ""Hyundai Motor aims to build a full lineup of EVs, from affordable EVs to luxury and high-performance models, and launch 21 models by 2030 to provide consumers with various options."" China will get more subcompact EREV models too, he added.
Earlier reports indicated that the next Hyundai Santa Fe and future trucks could get an EREV setup, but that was not confirmed on today's call.
Hyundai isn't the only automaker getting into the EREV game. Stellantis is as well, with the highly anticipated Ram Ramcharger truck that rides on a battery EV platform but also uses a V6 engine only for recharging. Mercedes-Benz is rumored to offer the same setup as an option on the upcoming CLA-Class too. By building cars on an EV platform but adding a gas engine only for charging, automakers can prepare their R&D and manufacturing for the future while the EV charging networks get built out—all with the ostensible goal of going all-electric someday. At least, that's the idea, anyway.
In the meantime, Hyundai also announced a major expansion of its hybrid offerings. The automaker has seen considerable success in the U.S. with cars like the Santa Fe Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid, so more models are coming, including to Genesis. Those cars will also be built in Georgia. ""This strategy will allow the company to respond swiftly to the North American market, which currently faces a shortage of hybrid supply, and to enhance the operational efficiency of the factory,"" Chang said.
Perhaps most importantly, Hyundai is targeting one thing for all of these electrified cars that has often eluded other automakers: actual profits across the board. ""The company expects to achieve equal profitability on its entire powertrain lineup, including ICE, hybrids, EREVs and EVs by 2030,"" Chang said.

Polestar’s CEO Is Out,https://insideevs.com/news/731572/polestar-new-ceo/,"Thomas Ingenlath, the automaker’s head honcho from its inception, has resigned.",8/28/2024 3:46,"Polestar, the electric car manufacturer owned by Chinese-based giant Geely, will have a new chief executive officer starting in October. On October 1, Thomas Ingenlath, who served as CEO since the company’s inception as a standalone automaker in 2017, will step down.
Michael Lohscheller will take his place and try to transform Polestar from an EV startup into a bigger player in the automotive industry. Lohscheller was CEO at several other automotive companies in the last decade. Between 2017 and 2021 he spearheaded Opel, then moved to the position of Global CEO at VinFast. After just seven months, he jumped ship to Nikola, the maker of battery- and hydrogen-powered big rigs, where he acted as both president and CEO until September 2023, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Michael Lohscheller, the new CEO of Polestar
“Polestar has experienced an exceptional start-up phase and with a broader model line-up, Michael Lohscheller is the ideal leader to guide Polestar into its next chapter,” said Winfried Vahland, Polestar’s incoming Chairman. “His deep industry knowledge, especially in driving operational excellence, developing a coherent product strategy and strengthening the global market presence will be instrumental in the next chapter of Polestar’s growth.”
Polestar, which currently sells three models–the Polestar 2, Polestar 3 and Polestar 4–had a rough first half of the year in terms of sales. Globally, the Geely subsidiary sold roughly 20,200 cars, down 27% year-over-year.
More Polestar Stories
All three models are currently being assembled in China, which isn’t ideal for the aspiring automaker’s U.S. ambitions, considering the hiked import tariffs. Its fortunes, stateside at least, lie on the Polestar 3 which recently entered local production in South Carolina, thus avoiding costly import duties and keeping losses to a minimum.
As a reminder, Polestar wants to fight with names like BMW, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. In other words, it’s betting on high-priced models in a market that seemingly wants more affordable cars, so it will be interesting to see what its new CEO will bring to the table.
“Polestar has already established itself as one of the most desirable and innovative brands in the electric vehicle space, and I look forward to working with the talented team to build on this strong foundation and accelerate our development,” said Michael Lohscheller.",Iulian Dnistran
This Was Not A Great Week For 'Legacy' Auto—With Two Exceptions,https://insideevs.com/news/731161/cm-ford-gm-vw-hyundai/,"Let's game out what this week's news meant for the EV transition at Ford, GM, Volkswagen and Hyundai. Plus, Volvo has big plans for EX90.",8/23/2024 9:15,"Sometimes, when I look back at the commitments many so-called ""legacy"" automakers made to go fully electric and software-powered one day, it feels like all of them thought: ""How hard can it be, right?"" As we saw this week, the answer is ""very hard.""
And one day, we may all look back on 2024 as the most chaotic year of the transition to a cleaner and hopefully better future for the car industry.
For this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news about the EV transition and technology, I want to look back at some wins and losses from several of the big players and parse out what it means for what's next.
Plus: Volvo makes a big bet on the EX90, and BYD solidifies its plans for Mexico. Let's go.
Ford EV Battery
Let's face it: this was not a great week for several big, legacy automakers trying to figure out what's next. We'll start with Ford, since that was the big one.
A few years ago, Ford decided to separate out its sales and financial results into three divisions: EVs, traditional gas vehicles and its commercial operation. At least one goal was to ""unlock Tesla-like value,"" to drive up the stock price by showing investors—who care about the future—that it was progressing like a big tech company.
It hasn't worked. Instead, the continual losses of the electric Model e division kind of made Ford a punching bag. Every quarter and at least once a year, the headlines and investors gripe about the billions in losses and mounting costs around going electric, even if that is to be expected for ramping up an entirely new supply chain and manufacturing ecosystem.
It turns out the investors care about their future, but also want their money right now.
Those losses, and the newfound belief that battery costs won't ever make big electric SUVs and trucks truly viable, meant a strategy shift this week: Ford is canceling a three-row electric SUV, pushing back a new electric truck and focusing on hybrids instead.
As my colleague Kevin Williams pointed out, this means that besides a new electric commercial van, Ford won't have any new EV models until 2027.
That's three years away; three years ago, I'd wager most of the vehicles we write about on InsideEVs didn't exist yet.
There are two ways to read Ford's news this week. The generous read is that Ford is doing what it can to keep investors happy, as any publicly traded company must; that the truly telling move is that Ford isn't slowing down on battery plant investments; and that it may well be right about hybrids being a better solution for bigger vehicles.
But if you want to go glass-half-empty, then we could look at this week as the one where Ford began its transition to just being a gas-powered truck company someday—one that could never make EVs work in volume and will be a kind of John Deere-type company in the subsequent decades. Give Ford an excuse, in other words, and it will take the easy way out.
Market realities are one thing, sure. But so far, Ford's path to EV profits seems dismal. It needs a reset, and pushing those products back to the latter half of this decade—where it may even have to compete with China's automakers in America—is a huge gamble.
US-spec 2024 Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB exterior driving shots
Then we have Volkswagen, the original ""pivot to EVs"" automaker. The long-awaited ID. Buzz is finally coming to America after a development cycle that makes a new Tesla look punctual, and the price and specs just do not feel competitive. And after ""indefinitely postponing"" the ID.7 sedan for America, Volkswagen has in the pipeline... what, exactly? More mainstream-looking EV models coming, we think, but again, not until the latter part of this decade. And then it may have tougher competition than ever.
Ford, thankfully, is not VW, which only has around 4% market share in the U.S., still lacks a strong brand identity here and just doesn't have that compelling of a lineup beyond the ID.4 (which, admittedly, is better than ever) and the GTI and Golf R. We are getting to a point where it's worth asking if the U.S. market needs the VW brand at all; it had better have an answer to that before the day comes when it has to go up against BYD and the like on our shores.
Next up is General Motors, which is actually in the midst of a pretty good year for EV releases and sales. But it still laid off 1,000 software and services employees this week in an effort to ""streamline"" operations and, based on all we've heard, reduce bloat and bureaucracy. Again, the generous read is that under its new software leadership, GM is taking steps to focus on power-hitter hires and be the best in the game; the less generous read is that it still hasn't figured out its software game. And 1,000 software engineers say they were ""thrown onto the curb like useless trash."" It's just very unfortunate.
You can't expect car companies to make unprofitable products forever, and sure, they're all reckoning with rapidly changing buyer tastes—people want plug-in hybrids now, actually!—in a capital-investive environment that takes years of planning and development.
Yet it does feel like many of them should've figured this out by now. And it's only fair to begin wondering if they ever can, or if the plan is to just pivot back to gas cars like they've always done.
So what are the two exceptions I put in that headline? Well, Hyundai Motor Group (whose executives have claimed to us that their EVs are profitable) is now the no. 2 EV seller behind Tesla in the U.S. And BMW just outpaced Tesla's EV sales in Europe. True, both situations were ""helped"" by Tesla's lost sales momentum. Still, both are remarkable achievements.
One Honda executive is probably right: you can't force people into EVs. But in the next few years, we'll find out who's actually serious about making the technology of the future work, and who just expected customers to show up like they always have.
Volvo EX90 Rear view
That was a long time to charge up to 30% (Critical Materials is an old Nissan Leaf today) so I'll be quicker on these next two items. You'll read a full review of the new, electric Volvo EX90 from Deputy Editor Mack Hogan next week, but make no mistake: this is a big deal for the Geely-owned Swedish brand. From Automotive News, which begins with Volvo's sliding electric sales:
But Michael Cottone, Volvo Cars' U.S. boss, hopes to change that trajectory with a pair of next-generation crossovers that will bookend the brand's EV lineup and reach crucial new audiences.
At the top end is the new three-row EX90 flagship expected to glide into stores in late 2024. It will be followed by Volvo's most compact and least expensive model — the EX30 crossover — in the second half of next year.
""[The EX90] is the first car that we will have launched and developed outside of Europe in our company's almost 100-year history,"" Cottone said at an Aug. 21 media event in Southern California. ""This car was designed for the U.S. market and then built in the U.S. market.""
[...]  Volvo dealer Matthew Haiken said the EX90 will resonate because it is an evolution of a familiar design. The new model has the DNA of the XC90, which Haiken said has become a classic like the Range Rover or Porsche 911.
""Most EVs look like computers on wheels,"" said Haiken, owner of Prestige Collection, which operates Volvo stores in East Hanover and Englewood, N.J. ""The EX90 is the antithesis of the Tesla Model X.""
After months of delays due to software issues (here we go again) Volvo officials say they will be careful here to allocate EX90 volume to the right places that can meet demand: ""California, the Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic region.""
Also, did you know the XC90 is still Volvo's bestselling model and accounts for almost one-third of its volume? I did not. That's also why Volvo is bringing back the XC90 as a heavily refreshed plug-in hybrid; I'm wondering if that was always in the cards, or if it's hedging its bets in case the EX90 doesn't take off.
BYD Shark
And here, finally, is why complacency is not an option.
Mexico's federal government is under pressure from the U.S., its biggest trading partner and ours, not to give incentives to the Chinese automakers to set up factories there.
But nothing is stopping the local governments in Mexico from doing that, and Reuters reports that's coming right along:
Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has narrowed its list of finalists for the location of a manufacturing plant in Mexico down to three states and is reviewing a range of proposed incentives from them, the firm's country head said on Wednesday.
Jorge Vallejo, BYD's Mexico director general, told Reuters the company was reviewing the latest proposals by the candidate states, which have offered ""many benefits"" including fiscal, land, management and preferential pricing incentives.
Mexico's northern Nuevo Leon state is an automotive hub, and the location of a proposed Tesla mega-factory. It will also be home to a new Volvo plant, the state's governor said this week.
BYD executives swear that they aren't eyeing the U.S. market and a Mexican factory would be focused on that country's market and the rest of Latin America. If you truly believe that, email me, because I have a bridge to sell you. Tariffs will only keep these automakers out of the U.S. for so long; they had better come up with a way to compete, and 2027 may be too late.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 Microfactory Singapore
To his credit, I do think Ford CEO Jim Farley gets the threat to his company posed by China. ""As CEO of a company that has had trouble competing with the Japanese and South Koreans,"" Farley said this earlier year, ""we have to fix this problem. We have to address this."" He's right, too—and I think he's probably right about huge expensive batteries not being the answer.
So how does Ford, or any of these companies here, fix that problem? What aren't they doing now that they should be?

Zeekr Plans To Add 'Innovative Super Hybrid' Flagship In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/730921/zeekr-super-hybrid-geely-2025/,Zeekr CEO Andy An announced during the brand's Q2 earnings call that the all-electric brand is adding plug-in hybrid power for its flagship SUV.,8/21/2024 13:30,"Electric Vehicle startup and spinoff from Geely, Zeekr, had its second-quarter earnings call this morning. Things seem to be going well, but Zeekr CEO Andy An dropped a bombshell at the end of the call, confirming a rumor on social media. Zeekr will add a hybrid model to its lineup.
Now, this is definitely confusing for everyone involved. Currently, Zeekr advertises itself as a fully electric brand, and this new hybrid model throws a wrench into that. Even more interesting is that An says it will use an entirely new hybrid technology system. This will be different from the NordThor system currently in service in other Geely and Lynk & Co products. This model will be a flagship, sitting at the top of the Zeekr range.
I reached out to Zeekr for more clarity on the decision. Zeekr’s flagship, a large SUV, will be available in two forms. One will be pure electric, but the other will be what the representative called an “innovative super hybrid powertrain…designed to merge the benefits of a battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and extended-range electric vehicle,” the representative said via WeChat. “This innovative powertrain aims to provide an ultimate driving experience akin to that of BEVs, while delivering exceptional fuel efficiency at high speeds and an enhanced range,” Zeekr says this model will launch in the second half of 2025.
Considering Zeekr’s status as a premium brand inside and outside of China, it’s clear that Zeekr’s product lineup is aiming straight at brands like BYD. On paper, Zeekr’s basic idea for a luxury flagship PHEV crossover feels like it’s aimed straight at the (BYD) Yangwang U8, the Land Rover Defender-esque SUV that can float down rivers and moonwalk across the road. It could also compete with Western luxury flagship models like the Mercedes-Benz G580 EV, or BMW XM.
On some level, this feels like a step backward, as if Zeekr and Geely are admitting that perhaps EVs aren’t always the solution, even in the world’s biggest EV market. Zeekr says that it made the decision to “meet the needs of our customers, especially regarding the powertrain of a large SUV.” Perhaps this is prescient, and Zeekr (and Geely) are just reading the room and responding to the strong demand for hybrid amongst consumers. Ford killed its large EV crossover to focus on hybrids, to the chagrin and ire of EV enthusiasts and analysts alike. Maybe Ford and Zeekr are ahead of the game here.
On the other hand, Zeekr’s earnings call revealed that its EV-only lineup is doing well. Sales are up nearly 100% compared to last year during the same quarter. Losses are up 28.7% compared to last year but down 10.7% compared to last quarter. Gross revenue is up and Zeekr’s vehicle margin has improved as well. Zeekr says it is still on track to reach profitability, but it didn’t say if it will change its original goal by the end of this year. It plans to launch two new full EV models by the end of the year, the 7X crossover and the MIX mini MPV.
Given Zeekr’s focus on growth and profit, it wouldn’t be surprising if Zeekr’s other EVs and now hybrid vehicles make it out of China. Will the U.S. be next? We’ll just have to wait and see how things play out after this year’s election.

"Ford's 'Skunkworks' EV Truck Will Be Midsize, Not Compact",https://insideevs.com/news/730922/ford-skunkworks-ev-midsize-compact/,Ford announced lots of EV and hybrid news today. Among them: its secretive California-based truck project may be bigger than expected.,8/21/2024 12:30,"Things are changing at Ford. Again. Apparently, and perhaps understandably, fed up with the lack of profits from electric vehicles despite becoming America's second-best-selling EV brand behind Tesla, the Dearborn automaker is retooling its electrified roadmap.
A three-row electric SUV is out, a hybrid three-row SUV is in, and a truck that seems like an F-150 Lightning replacement has been pushed back to 2027.
But one of the most interesting details in Ford's strategy announcement today deals with the secretive ""skunkworks"" project based in California: the first vehicle on a new, lower-cost EV platform will be a midsize pickup truck, not a compact one as many—including us—had assumed.
On a media briefing InsideEVs attended this morning, Ford officials declined to provide many more details about the truck, including what its exact size could be—or if it will have any direct analogs in the current Ford lineup. That included a question on whether the truck will be more like the Ranger, or the smaller Maverick. ""We're not going to talk about that,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on the call. ""We'd love to put it all out there right now, but it's too early to do that, given the competitive nature of the segment.""
However, in Ford's own parlance, ""compact"" pretty clearly refers to the Maverick, while ""midsize"" refers to the Ranger. In other words, it feels like a safe bet that this truck should be larger than expected.
Lawler and other officials declined to offer any other new details about the truck, including its battery, range, performance or other specs. Previously, CEO Jim Farley confirmed the skunkworks team was working on a low-cost EV platform that would yield electric models that are profitable from $25,000 to $30,000; it's unclear if that remains the truck's price target or not. The vehicle was presumed to be a competitor to a raft of newer, more affordable EV options coming to market in 2025, 2026 and beyond, including the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV, the Jeep Renegade, the Kia EV3 and possibly a new entrant from Tesla.
But if the ""skunkworks"" truck ends up being more Ranger-sized—while the T3 seems to analogous to the F-150—that would be an interesting decision on Ford's part, and one that could potentially drive up its price tag.
Asked whether this new midsize truck could still be in Farley's $30,000 and under comments, ""I wouldn't associate the comment with specifics of our announcement today,"" a Ford spokesperson told InsideEVs. This person added that Farley's comments are indeed ""a target, not an announcement of actual pricing of the product itself."" The gas-powered Ranger starts at $32,720, before destination fees. It is also sold as a plug-in hybrid, but not in the U.S. market.
It's also an interesting sizing choice for Ford that may be tied to things like battery costs, range and capability, as well as sale price.
Ford Ranger Plug-in Hybrid 2025
The Ranger consistently trails other midsize truck options in the field in sales, including the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon and Toyota Tacoma—the latter of which remains the undisputed champion of the field. Last year, the smaller Maverick outsold the Ranger nearly three-to-one. And many prospective EV buyers had been looking forward to the possibility of a compact urban truck that runs on batteries but can still do some light towing and hauling in a pinch.
But much of this is speculation until we know more about the truck. Ford today said it's due to launch in 2027 and will ""cater to customers who want more for their money—more range, more utility, more useability."" Ford has not announced a manufacturing site for the midsize truck yet.
Ford's ""skunkworks"" EV project—so named due to its secretive nature—was established almost three years ago as a kind of internal startup. It has since poached top talent from Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Apple and more, and has sought to make a clean-sheet EV platform that can produce many lower-cost vehicles and compete with newcomers from China.
Could this be the electric Ford truck you wanted? Let us know in the comments.

"Ford Revises Its EV Plan: SUV Canceled, More Hybrids Coming",https://insideevs.com/news/730889/ford-ev-strategy-august-2024/,"Ford is America's no. 2 electric brand. But profits have been elusive, so it's adjusting the entire plan.",8/21/2024 8:00,"Ford is America's number two electric vehicle brand behind Tesla. But getting there hasn't been easy.
Over the past few years of F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E sales, Ford has sunk billions into models that aren't proving to be profitable, all while it deals with an uneven electric market, a boosted in interest in hybrids, intensifying competition and a rising China.
As a result, the Dearborn automaker today announced some major changes to its EV and hybrid plan, and that includes 10% less capital spending on purely electric models overall.
Ford announced that it will no longer make a three-row electric SUV as planned, but will go hybrid with those models instead; the so-called ""skunkworks"" electric truck is confirmed to be a midsize truck, not a compact one as many assumed; will not launch any EVs unless they can be profitable in the first 12 months; and continue to provide gas and diesel vehicles, among other things.
The changes in plans could equate to an anticipated $1.9 billion in additional costs, Ford officials said.
""It's coming back to understanding the customer, understanding how this is going to transition over time,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on a media briefing this morning. ""It's about providing them those choices that meet their duty cycles and their needs, and that is giving them the options between full battery electric vehicles, hybrid technologies.""
Ford F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E
Ford officials didn't elaborate when asked by InsideEVs where their EV sales or profits were projected to be versus where they are now, but said its overall strategy to use electrification to reduce CO2 emissions has not changed.
""We are launching multiple electric vehicles in Europe this year,"" Ford said in a statement. ""We are adjusting the company’s North America vehicle roadmap to offer a range of electrification options designed to speed customer adoption, including lower prices and longer ranges.""
Among the major changes in strategy: Ford is pushing back its midsize T3 electric truck, considered a more cutting-edge successor to the F-150 Lightning, to the second half of 2027. The truck will be assembled at BlueOval City’s Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, Ford officials said. Originally, it was supposed to start production this year.
""It will launch with the launch of the full-size pickup,"" Lawler said of that plant. ""So there is a delay there of about 18 months versus what we were planning earlier. We'll continue to build out construction, and we'll continue to get that plant ready for production and move forward.""
Lawler added that there are no plans to cancel any current offerings, such as the Lightning and Mach-E.
Pre-production sketch of the F-150 Lightning
At the same time, Ford plans to introduce an all-new, fully electric commercial van that will begin production in 2026 in Ohio. That follows a plan for Ford to focus electrification, and offerings, in areas where it has ""competitive advantages"": commercial vans, mid-size and large pickup trucks, and ""long-range"" SUVs.
Ford officials reaffirmed that the so-called ""skunkworks"" plan—meant to develop a low-cost EV platform with a team out of California that's designed to take on Tesla and China—will continue. This platform is expected to produce several vehicles, including a crossover and commercial vehicles.
But this is the first time Ford has confirmed that the truck coming out of it will be a midsize one, not a compact one. It is ""expected to cater to customers who want more for their money—more range, more utility, more useability,"" Ford said in a news release.
Lawler declined to elaborate on whether this truck would be sized more like the smaller Maverick or the Ranger, one size up.
Lawler said that Ford has ""multiple hybrid technologies under development,"" and is working on other powertrain options. ""And then we're going to continue to provide gas vehicles and diesel vehicles, because there's a demand for those and that's going to continue,"" he said.
Previously, Ford's planned three-row electric SUV—which Ford CEO Jim Farley once described as a ""personalized bullet train""—was merely delayed to 2027. Now it will not be made at all, replaced instead by hybrid models.
This does mean Ford will lose $400 million in sunk costs on that vehicle, Lawler and others said today. Lawler also reaffirmed that future Super Duty trucks will go hybrid as well.
The revised plan focuses on Ford's profitability, which has been a struggle amid high battery costs and capital costs involved with producing EVs. Ford breaks out its electric Model e division's results separately, and last year it lost $4.7 billion on sales of 116,000 EVs. Though sales of its current models—the Lightning truck, Mach-E crossover and E-Transit van—have been rising, they have not been enough to compensate for those costs, Lawler said.
Lawler added that in the first half of next year, Ford is planning an ""EV Day"" event where it expects to elaborate more on plans for the hybrid three-row SUV, possibly offer more news on production locations and elaborate more its battery strategy.
An artist's rendering of Ford's EV truck, once believed to be a compact model.
While battery costs have declined significantly in recent years, they are a persistent headache for many automakers, Ford included. More recently, CEO Farley has been candid about their costs and what they mean for Ford's emphasis on larger vehicles, urging a shift to smaller EVs: “These huge, enormous EVs are never going to make money: the battery is $50,000, even with low-nickel, LFP chemistry,"" he said earlier this summer. ""They will never be affordable.”
Ford EV Battery
Part of Ford's announcements today also dealt with how and where it sources EV batteries from, which it says will be key to driving costs down.
The automaker said it, and partner LG Energy Solutions, will attempt to move some Mustang Mach-E battery production from Poland to Michigan next year to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act incentives. The BlueOval SK joint venture in Kentucky should start battery production for the Lightning and E-Transit next year; BlueOval City in Tennessee should get underway in late 2025 as well, to make batteries for the new electric commercial van. ""Those same cells will be sourced to later power the next-generation electric truck to be assembled at BlueOval City and future emerging technology electrified vehicles,"" the automaker said. ""This common cell strategy gives Ford significant sourcing flexibility for manufacturing across multiple segments and electrified platforms as the market continues to evolve.""
Finally, cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery production in Michigan remains on track for 2026, which Ford says will qualify for IRA incentives as ""America’s first automaker-backed LFP battery plant.""
These moves may put Ford in a position to escape the scathing headlines built on its EV losses in recent years. But they may also come as a disappointment to those who were hoping for a more EV-centric future at Ford, including the three-row SUV or a sooner deployment of the possible Lightning successor. In the interim, however, the focus on hybrids may just put Ford more in line with customer demands—it has seen considerable success with the hybrid F-150 and other models.
""Our focus here is to remake Ford into high growth, higher margin, more capital, efficient and durable business,"" Lawler said. ""And that means these vehicles need to be profitable. And if they're not profitable, based on where the customer is in the market is, we will pivot and adjust and make those tough decisions, and that's what we've done.""

"Is It Better To Lease A New Electric Vehicle, Or Buy A Used One?",https://insideevs.com/news/730652/car-buying-leasing-used-evs/,"Leasing can get you some incredible deals on new EVs right now. But don't count out the used market, either. Here's our guide to both.",8/19/2024 13:15,"The electric vehicle market has excellent opportunities for buyers looking to score a deal. Lease specials on some EVs offer super-cheap payments for nicely equipped models, while the pre-owned market presents some fantastic values. A lot of buyers are torn between a new lease or a pre-owned purchase, but luckily for them, we’re here to help.
After all, buying a brand-new EV—either financing or with cash—may not be the smartest move when so many savings are available through other means. Most of the rebates and discounts are focused on the lease programs and the fact that EVs depreciate (right now, anyway) at a much more accelerated rate compared to their ICE counterparts.
A lease allows a customer to score a brand-new car at very affordable payments while hedging against the future resale value.  Some of the staff here at InsdieEVs have scored some great deals on the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Kia EV6. Plus, the technology at work here could evolve significantly in the years to come, so it may not be a bad idea to be flexible when it comes time to look at what’s next.
However, leasing isn’t for everyone and some buyers may not want to get into the constant cycle of payments, or they may not fit the profile of a driver that stays within the mileage uses of most leases. Of course, there are many EV shoppers that could go either way, and that is where things get tricky.
While there isn’t one right answer and it often depends on the budget and goals of the buyer, I’ve handled several cases recently where customers asked my team to explore both new lease deals and pre-owned options.
While the lease payments were super tempting, most of these clients ended up opting for a pre-owned car. I’ll lay out the math as to why they chose this path with a recent case.
Below is a grid of lease deals on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited we did for a customer in NY. We shopped a zero down, 10,000-mile lease for both 24 and 36-month programs with all tax and fees included.
The cheapest payment we found was $642 per month on a 36-month program. That is a total lease cost of $23,112—not bad at all for a car with an outstanding electric range and a retail price of almost $60,000.
We also found one customer a deal on a Certified 2023 Ioniq 5 Limited with about 11,000 miles on the clock.
2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5
This customer wasn’t going to have to pay sales tax on this purchase due to trade equity, but the total cost came out to $39,000. That’s about a $20,000 savings in depreciation compared to the new MSRP.  While electric vehicles are depreciating at an accelerated rate, the biggest drop happens within the first year or two.
This customer was hedging that the used '23 Ioniq 5 was unlikely to drop in value by another $20,000 over the next three years, and it probably isn’t. Even if it lost an additional $15,000 in value, that still puts them about $8,000 ahead when compared to the lease.
This same scenario played out two other times when I was working on deals for both an EV6 and a Volkswagen ID.4. There, the projected depreciation drop on a used model was likely to be less than the fixed total cost of leasing a new car.
Granted, this comparison requires a bit of guesswork as there isn’t data for the value of some five-to-six-year-old EVs, since many of these models haven’t been around that long. And the auto industry is, in many ways, struggling to properly value used EVs.
But it’s probably safe to say that the deprecation curves generally follow the same pattern as ICE cars, in that the worst drop happens within two years, and then it levels out a bit. Furthermore, if you did choose to buy instead of lease, and then held onto that car for a while, the greater financial value you’d get out of that purchase.
For buyers who value lower payments—and having a car that’s always in the warranty period—leasing would be the way to go. Others may prefer the flexibility of ownership that a pre-owned purchase offers since they can trade in later or hold onto that car however they like.
If you are shopping for leases with EV models, make sure to check out the selection of similar pre-owned options. That may end up being a better bang for your buck in the end.

China Was Supposed To Be The Future. Now It's A 'Money Pit',https://insideevs.com/news/730626/china-ev-sales-cm-august/,"The golden goose is no longer laying eggs for car companies. Also: EVs continue to outpace the rest of the market, but with a catch.",8/19/2024 9:44,"It wasn't supposed to be like this.
When Western and other Asian car companies started moving into China in force in the 2000s and 2010s, they thought it would be a kind of golden goose that would lay its golden eggs forever.
By the middle of the decade, it had become the largest and most important market for nearly every automaker, whether they were big like General Motors or smaller and more niche like Porsche; by the end of that decade, it became the long-sought key to stability and sustained profits for Tesla. And it drove product decisions that many of us felt in the U.S., Europe and beyond, like the push toward an electric vehicle future driven by China's policies.
Not so anymore. Somehow, none of those ""foreign"" automakers counted on how quickly China's homegrown car companies would accelerate on their own. Now, the latest data shows how their bet on China has turned into a real money pit.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and transportation news, coming soon to your inbox. Sign up here if you want the latest dispatches in email form.
Also on tap today: some good news about EV sales in the U.S., with an asterisk, and a top labor leader is speaking at the Democratic National Convention this week in Chicago. Let's dig in.
Kudos to the Wall Street Journal for gathering so much data on sales and profits from joint ventures in China. But any way you want to look at the charts in that story, things are pretty bleak.
As has been reported extensively here and elsewhere, car buyers in China are turning pretty exclusively to homegrown Chinese brands, which have become more advanced in software and battery tech and are better suited to their individual tastes. I hope our friends at the Journal don't mind, but I'll borrow one such chart that shows how GM's profits from Chinese joint ventures are going:
No other way to say it: ouch.
This is especially tough when you consider how much the ""foreign"" automakers staked on China. The Volkswagen Group, and its namesake brand, have never had such a huge market share in the U.S., for example; not like it does in Europe and Latin America. Stellantis has some truck brands here, for the most part. And GM and Ford have largely absconded from Europe in recent years too.
So basically, if they lose China—and many of them have already—they're toast. Even Tesla, which helped send China's EV sector into overdrive, is getting a ""thanks, but no thanks"" from buyers these days.
It's bad, but hey, things can always get worse. From the story:
Chrysler owner Stellantis pulled out of manufacturing cars in China in 2022 after its JV that made Jeeps filed for bankruptcy. But it returned to the country a year later by buying a roughly 20% stake in Chinese EV startup Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology. Last month a new JV between the two companies shipped a first batch of Leapmotor EVs to Europe.
[...] Tesla’s share of revenue from China slipped to less than a fifth in the first half of 2024, down from more than a quarter at the 2021 peak.
Manufacturers from China’s Asian neighbors aren’t faring better, according to the latest results. Toyota’s Chinese JV income fell 73% in the quarter through June compared with the same period of 2023, while Honda’s equity income was all but wiped out.
“Global automakers in China still haven’t found a bottom,” said Tu Le, managing director of industry research firm Sino Auto Insights.
That, and they increasingly have to compete with China's automakers on their home turf, especially where the Europeans are concerned—or markets they though they'd own forever like Latin America.
Maybe the approach is ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,"" like Stellantis is doing with Leapmotor. But that's surely now how these car companies envisioned the Chinese market playing out for them once.
Kia EV9
Meanwhile in America, every day we see evidence that counters the ""EV sales are down"" headlines you read everywhere else. Let's take June's registrations. According to the latest from S&P Global Mobility, new EV registrations rose 3.1% year-over-year that month (the latest month where the full data was available) which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize the overall car market is down 8.8% since 2023.
Blame high interest rates, among other things.
The biggest concern to me isn't sales; it's how long these tax incentives, discounts and deals will exist that are clearly driving a lot of EV adoption. I'm certainly not convinced they'll stick around forever. Here's Automotive News with more:
""The June month numbers were good for EVs,"" said Kent Chiu, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""But behind them were pretty strong incentives as a motivator.""
Discounts on some mainstream electric crossovers climbed as high as $18,000 per vehicle, a number unheard of for their gasoline and hybrid counterparts, according to data from Motor Intelligence. The average incentive on the Kia EV9 in June was $18,081, Motor Intelligence said.
Toyota's battery-electric bZ4x crossover had incentives of $11,761 on average in June, according to Motor Intelligence, while the similarly sized RAV4 had just $1,691 per vehicle. The RAV4 comes in gasoline and hybrid versions. Incentives on the electric Nissan Ariya crossover were $14,779 for the month versus $4,267 for the gas-powered Nissan Rogue, Motor Intelligence said.
Some of the incentive money comes indirectly through EV leasing, which allows finance companies to claim the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and pass some or all of it on to consumers. But automakers and their finance arms are not obligated to do so.
Another motivator for EV growth, that story says, is the sheer glut of new options available in 2024. Stuff like the Kia EV9, Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV and even Tesla Cybertruck weren't around last year.
""As more EVs come to market and occupy segments that match internal-combustion vehicles, there will be more consumers that switch over to the EV space,"" Chiu told the outlet.
But the deals probably aren't sustainable forever, so grab one while you can.
UAW Harris Walz
Like it or not, EVs are now a source of considerable partisan bickering in the U.S. and beyond, with the two presidential candidates presenting stark differences in incentives around the policies that are driving their manufacturing and adoption.
I don't doubt we'll hear something about EVs this week as the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago. That's especially true as United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain is set to speak at the convention today.
The UAW is reliably Democratic, even with huge member bases in swing or redder states like Michigan and Ohio, so the Harris campaign is hoping the union will help turn out the votes.
And in typical Fain fashion, he's not pulling punches. From the Detroit News:
Fain has emerged as a top voice for Democrats over the past year in the electoral battleground of Michigan and on the national stage after leading a historic, successful hourly worker strike against major automakers Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV.
The UAW's executive board endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, 10 days after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and Harris launched her campaign.
The Detroit-based union last week launched an operation among its members to mobilize support in Harris' favor, pledged $1.5 million to the Democratic National Committee and filed a federal labor complaint against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
""I am very confident that Vice President Harris, as president, will have our back, just as she has as vice president,"" Fain told The Detroit News in a recent interview. ""And I'm very confident that Donald Trump could care less about working-class people. He's a con man.""
Meanwhile, Trump has seemed to soften somewhat on his anti-EV rhetoric, possibly thanks to his newfound support from Elon Musk. But we expect to hear much more from both sides as election season heats up.

The Volkswagen GTI EV Will Be About 'More Than Just Power',https://insideevs.com/news/730392/volkswagen-id-gti-gokart-handling/,"""It will be a real go-kart,"" a top VW executive says of the electric GTI. ""I’ve driven a prototype and it’s really amazing.”",8/16/2024 8:23,"Volkswagen has had its ups and downs as it figures out what an electric future could look like. But one bright spot has been the idea that the GTI badge is coming to an electric vehicle for the first time. Now, VW's technical chief reaffirmed that that car—a GTI version of the upcoming ID.2—should be coming in 2026, and it will keep the focus on handling fun.
According to a recent report published by Autocar, it will have less than 300 horsepower, but it will be very fun to drive. The report quotes Kai Grünitz, who is a VW board member responsible for technical development, and who first of all confirmed that the GTI badge will live on into the age of electric cars.
Grünit said, “GTI is alive and we’ll keep it alive in the future. The GTI badge is about passion, and when we started looking at ideas for an electric GTI, we knew it’s about more than just power.” Volkswagen has so far used GTX branding to define its more powerful electric offerings, like the ID.5 GTX. Still, GTI will be used alongside it in the future—GTX may be used for all-wheel drive vehicles while GTI would be reserved for sporty front-wheel drive models like the upcoming hot ID 2.
It's worth noting that this GTI isn't quite like the GTI most Americans know.
That car is based on the Volkswagen Golf, which is getting an electric version, but one that has been delayed to 2029 as he automaker figures out its software and technical challenges. Instead, this ID.2-based GTI is smaller, more like a Volkswagen Polo in other markets (and has also had its GTI variants over the years.) Since it's smaller than U.S. buyers are used to, it's been unclear whether this one will make it to American dealers.
Instead of the ID.Golf's future-facing platform, the ID.2 will be built on a more affordable front-wheel-drive version of the MEB platform, which will underpin other smaller electric VWs. This is similar to what Kia is doing with the lite version of its E-GMP platform, which ditches 800 volts and rear-wheel drive in the quest to cut costs and make its smaller EVs more affordable.
If you’ve driven any of the current VW ID models, they are competent and drive great, but the driving experience isn’t the most fun, even with power going to the rear wheels. Their safety systems don’t allow any slip at the back, so they always feel glued to the road, and flooring it when coming out of a corner won’t make the rear step out.
So maybe going front-wheel drive and allowing for a bit more movement in the front is the way to go. Grünitz explained that you don’t need a lot of power to make an EV fun. He said, “With an electric car, adding a lot of power is really easy, but do we need 300bhp or 350bhp? With a GTI, what’s more important than power is drivability. It will be a real go-kart. I’ve driven a prototype and it’s really amazing.”
That sounds very encouraging, especially since one of the most fun affordable electric cars is the Mini Cooper SE, which allows you to turn off the traction and stability aids and just do smoky FWD burnouts all the time. With all the nannies off, driving the Cooper SE spiritedly around a twisty road is one of the best times you will ever have behind the wheel of an EV at any price, and it has less than 200 hp.
Mini prides itself on offering a go-kart-like driving experience in its vehicles, including its EVs. The combination of stiff suspension, which may make the car feel a bit bouncy over some uneven road surfaces, and very sharp and sensitive steering is what makes the driving experience feel go-kart-esque, so VW is probably drawing inspiration from that for its ID 2 GTI.
We know it’s possible to have fun in a relatively low-powered front-wheel-drive EV, and the VW exec seems very confident that the upcoming GTI will deliver on the fun front, so we’re eager to try it. And if you were wondering if the electric GTI is coming to the U.S., we asked VW about it, and it sounds like people within the company are pushing hard to make that happen.

"Hyundai Ioniq 9 May Debut At LA Auto Show, Kia EV4 In Q1 2025: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/729921/hyundai-ioniq-9-kia-ev4-la-auto-show-debut/,Local reports suggest that Hyundai is in the final phases of testing the Ioniq 9 in South Korea.,8/12/2024 17:59,"Electric vehicle sales may be up and down this year, but the Hyundai Motor Group is pushing forward with its EV plans. We already know that some of HMG's upcoming models include the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and the Kia EV4. Now Korean publication Newsis, citing industry sources, is reporting that production version of the Ioniq 9 may debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show (Nov 22-Dec 1) later this year. The report says the EV4 could arrive next spring.
HMG was the second best-selling electric car brand in the U.S. behind Tesla in the second quarter of this year. It posted outstanding 74% year-over-year EV sales growth on the back of its successful E-GMP-based models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and the Kia EV6 and the EV9. Now the Korean automaker is looking to its upcoming models to further strengthen its already robust line-up of EVs.
It was widely expected that Hyundai's equivalent to the Kia EV9 would be named the Ioniq 7, after the automaker showcased the ""Seven Concept"" back in 2021. But the automaker later changed that name to Ioniq 9, possibly turning it into a flagship and opening up room for smaller Ioniq 7 or Ioniq 8 models in different segments. It's expected to ride on the same E-GMP platform, offer three rows of seating and similar powertrain options as the EV9. The Korean outlet reports that Hyundai has been testing this model since March and is currently conducting final quality inspections.
Over at Kia, there's a high-riding four-door electric model in the pipeline. The automaker released images of the EV4 concept last year and it's hard to tell if it's a hatchback, sedan or a mix of both. The press images showcase a more angular fastback-esque version of the EV6 that Kia is calling an ""entirely new type of EV sedan."" Newsis reports that it will be positioned above the affordable EV3 hatchback—on sale in Korea and expected to arrive in the U.S. next year—and have similar powertrain and battery options.
The EV3 is already a smash hit on its home turf. It amassed over 10,000 reservations in less than a month after its launch. Company executives have labeled it a ""game changer."" Kia also sold a record number of EVs in the U.S. in the first six months of this year on the back of a largely positive reception to the three-row EV9.
Now Hyundai will hope to replicate that success for the newer and possibily fancier Ioniq 9. Local assembly of the seven-seater at the under construction ""Meta Plant"" outside Atlanta, Georgia should also help the automaker achieve that goal. It will hopefully qualify for the federal tax credit when it arrives. As more details surface, we'll keep you in the loop.

Why Are EV Sales 'Lagging'? Here Are Two Reasons.,https://insideevs.com/news/729698/ev-sales-tesla-chevy-bolt/,If EV sales are slowing at all—and the data is deeply inconsistent—then two types of cars tell us a lot.,8/9/2024 15:40,"First, the word ""lagging"" is in quotes both there and in that headline for a reason. That's because I don't really believe that electric vehicle sales are cratering as hard as many headlines would have you believe. It's an easy and clicky narrative to run with, but the truth is much more nuanced. Still, that's the narrative the entire industry seems to have adopted this year.
It's true that EV sales in 2024 aren't proving to be on this predictable, up-and-to-the-right growth curve that automakers and their suppliers hoped for. It's also true that many brands are up on electric sales while others are down, that an upcoming election that could reset emissions rules and incentives is throwing everything into turmoil, that charging networks are taking longer than expected to build out, that most Western and other Asian automakers are getting hammered by homegrown competition in China and that high interest rates are likely to make 2024 a down year for all cars across the board.
An all-electric future
Nearly all automakers have committed to going all-electric at some point in the future, some with harder and firmer dates than others. But a mix of complicated factors has led many to reevaluate their plans instead.
But the doom-and-gloom is hard to buy when you see that Ford's EV sales were up 31% in July alone, or that Hyundai and Kia are seeing rising sales, or that General Motors has more affordable models in the pipeline. Any of those automakers could hit 100,000 EVs produced this year, something only Tesla has done to date.
The truth is that a lot of these doubts seem to come when you consider EV sales in aggregate, particularly in America. And there are two reasons those don't look great.
I'll point to this data point from The Detroit Free Press (subscription required), which today had an excellent and in-depth look at uneven EV adoption and what it means for the paper's Big Three hometown automakers. Let's dig in:
U.S. EV adoption is growing at a pace more sluggish than most carmakers and experts had predicted. Cox Automotive said in June its full-year forecast puts EV purchases this year at about 1.3 million vehicles, or 8.3% of total new car sales, a slight boost from last year, when EV market share was 7.6%.
But Cox had expected EV sales to be closer to 9.5% of total sales for the year. Part of the reason for the reduced forecast was an unexpectedly large sales decline from U.S. EV leader Tesla and the slow launch of affordable EVs by General Motors.
I can't, in good faith, pin all of the EV adoption troubles on those two factors. But they have a lot to do with what's going on. Basically, without the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV—the $25,000-ish twins that carried GM's electric sales on their back for years until their discontinuation at the end of 2023—you get sales data without a significant player.
Since the Bolt duo sold almost 63,000 examples last year, the net effect is almost like saying the SUV segment would be in decline if Ford had stopped making the Expedition. It's not quite that high, but it's in the same galaxy. GM sold nearly as many Bolts alone as Ford sold EVs in 2023.
And with the Bolt phased out and nothing to make up for it—save for whatever remaining Bolts were on dealer lots at the start of this year—of course, EV sales would be down in aggregate. While GM has high hopes for the affordable Equinox EV, and I do too, it's going to be a long time before it hits Bolt levels of critical mass. If it ever does.
Still, things are looking up. GM hit a new quarterly record for EV sales in Q2 of this year. But if it's to break annual records, all Ultium EV models will have to come together to compensate for the lack of the Bolt models—and then hold the line until a reborn Bolt EUV debuts next year.
And then there's Tesla.
Let's just put it this way: when the clear, global market leader in EVs fails to keep its lineup of cars updated amid intensifying new competition, focuses on AI and robots instead of selling cars and has a CEO whose antics are pushing people away from the brand, sales are going to drop. And they are. Sales of non-Tesla EVs are surging, and as Bloomberg has reported all year, any EV slowdown seems to be a Tesla slowdown specifically. The Cybertruck won't save the company; some 90% of its sales are of the Model 3 and Model Y duo, and while the Model 3 got a decent update, the worldwide best-selling Model Y is really showing its age.
So when the company that made up more than 56% of U.S. EV sales last year starts a hard slump, then yes, it brings all total EV sales down with them. The loss of the Bolt and the decline of Tesla are creating a great deal of uncertainty in the overall market. It's like a basketball team that loses its two best players at once, like the Spurs in the late 1990s if injuries had somehow taken out Duncan and Robinson at the same time.
Yet the EV market in America in 2024 is faring far better than that. Incentives and deals still underpin it, and those cannot last forever. And the presidential election could disrupt policies that boost sales and incentivize manufacturing in America. But looked at this way, there's nothing to indicate that the influx of new, affordable EV models—the Kia EV3, the reborn Bolt, whatever Ford is planning, and so on—won't be able to juice things again. Plus, automakers are still struggling to make profitable EVs. That's coming sooner than you may think.
Sometimes, it's okay if growth isn't some up-and-to-the-right curve all of the time. It's just hard to squeeze that idea into a headline.

China's MG Motor Is Conquering Europe. Now It Wants To Build A Factory In Mexico,https://insideevs.com/news/729524/mg-motor-conquering-europe-mexico-china/,MG Motor plans to build a manufacturing base and research and development center in Mexico.,8/8/2024 12:00,"While the U.S. continues to restrict Chinese electric vehicles from entering its market, its neighbors are increasingly embracing affordable and well-made Chinese EVs.
The latest brand to show interest in capitalizing on the growing Latin American EV market is MG Motor. The former British brand is owned by China’s state-owned SAIC Motor, and it now plans to establish a manufacturing facility and a research and development center in Mexico.
The threat of the Mexico backdoor.
U.S. automakers fear that cheap and well-made Chinese EVs, which are already flooding Mexico, could also enter the U.S. if those brands set-up plants in the country. While U.S. could be a lucrative market for them, it is not the only country they're interested in. They see incomes rising in South America and Latin America as well, where they plan to expand regardless of America's protectionist policies.
By expanding further into Mexico, where it already sells models like the all-electric MG4 and the MG3 hybrid, it would be able to ""not only produce vehicles, but to also produce market intelligence specifically designed for and by Latin America,"" country lead Zhang Wei said in a statement.
The automaker said the Mexico plant, whose construction time and location details weren’t revealed, would help the SAIC Group grow and expand into the Caribbean and Latin America. The expansion would also allow MG Motor to launch its luxury brand, IM, in these markets, something the automaker said is on the cards.
MG Motor already has plants in China, Thailand and India. Plus it's planning to build a factory in Europe, where it is the best-selling Chinese brand with nearly 128,000 units sold in the first half of 2024, as per Dataforce numbers reported by Automotive News.
Mexico is emerging as the hotspot in North America for Chinese EVs. Brands like BYD and Chery Automobile already sell cars in the country. Reuters reported that one in 10 cars sold in Mexico last year were Chinese. Given the pace of Chinese investments in the country, that share will likely continue to grow.
Tesla also plans to build a factory in Mexico, but those plans are on pause as the company awaits the outcome of the presidential elections in November.
If Donald Trump gets elected, it would certainly hurt the U.S. auto industry. He has vowed to amend the U.S. Mexico Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement and slap 100-200% tariffs on cars made in Mexico. A ton of cars sold in the U.S. are made in Mexico, including those from General Motors, Ford, Mazda, Nissan, BMW and countless others.
Those cars should be made in the U.S., he said at the Republican National Convention, implying that he would allow Chinese carmakers to build factories in the U.S. Mexico, however, recently indicated that it was distancing itself from Chinese brands and had reportedly halted talks with BYD after pressure from the U.S.

We've addressed that question before. As InsideEVs contributor Ed Niedermeyer wrote recently, affordable EVs don't just happen; perhaps there's a way for China and America to work together in ways that are both mutually beneficial and stabilizing.
After all, think of the jobs that manufacturers like Toyota, Hyundai and BMW have brought to America with their factory options. Could BYD do the same over here? In a best case scenario, that could lead to tie-ups where American automakers get some EV knowledge (much as China once did when ramping up its industry) and maybe even defuse some tensions between two major geopolitical rivals.
Also, it was Trump, of all people, who suggested China's automakers just come here. I did not have that development on my bingo card for 2024.
But we're too probably too divided to go for it, and that stretches across party lines in America. A recent article from Hong Kong's South China Morning Post illustrates the Chinese perspective on all of this. (I'd add that the Post has had its independence from the ruling party questioned in recent years, but I'm including it here with that caveat so you an read it and make up your own mind.)
Some highlights:
Amid already substantial tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries – and fiery rhetoric against Chinese investment – Trump’s invitation has the potential to change the course of the US transition to EVs as well as open doors to Chinese business in a segment that has so far appeared closed.
Though far from fully fleshed out, his pitch is in line with a growing recognition worldwide of China’s critical role to the development of the EV industry and suggests an emerging split within the Republican Party about the future of Chinese industrial investment on US soil.
But such plans triggered local opposition. At a roundtable last Friday, Representative John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House select committee on China, focused on the ties between Chinese companies and the Chinese Communist Party in opposing any role for Gotion in America.
“I want to see this area have more jobs and investment but we must not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the enemy,” Moolenaar said, addressing an audience in Michigan’s rural Green Charter Township, where one of the plants would be built.
And as I mentioned, this isn't even a partisan thing. Many industry groups and even Democrats say ""hell no"" to this plan as well:
Scott Paul, the head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing trade group, called it a “foolish” idea. “At a time when many new and established brands are just scaling up EV production, [a] Beijing-backed Chinese auto juggernaut could wipe them out.”
Democrats, too, have expressed scepticism about letting Chinese carmakers into the US, trying to strike a balance between embracing a green future and guarding against potential national security risks.
“The Biden administration worries that Chinese cars, given the number of sensors and cameras and other sorts of devices on them, are essentially, as Gina Raimondo has said, ‘spy cameras on wheels’,” said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to Biden’s Commerce secretary.
Or, as analyst Michael Dunne also suggests, America could just make these automakers enter into a joint venture with our companies. After all, China did that to everyone else:
“I want the jobs, bring the capital, bring the know-how, and we have to trust American ingenuity to be able to absorb that and run with it,” Michael Dunne, founder of the Dunne Insights consultancy, contended on The Global Lithium podcast.
Dunne, a former General Motors executive, said the US ought to take a page from China’s playbook from the 1980s: encourage joint ventures to build up its auto industry.
“We’ll own a majority share. You have minority, but you get access to our lucrative market. And over time we hope to be able to learn how you make batteries.”
Finally, one analyst actually thinks Trump is more likely to go for it than a Democratic president:
But if Trump sought to encourage such investment, analysts said, he might not need the support of Republican lawmakers. And compared to his Democratic counterparts, they say, the former president is less vulnerable to being seen as weak on China, giving him more flexibility to invite Chinese firms in.
“Trump can do a lot to influence his party on this type of policy because he doesn’t need Congress to approve foreign direct investment,” said Jack Zhang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas, adding that foreign auto plants have previously found receptive audiences in red states for the jobs they bring.
It's all fascinating. And certainly unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. There are also some gray areas here, like allowing more battery manufacturers in before we allow full-blown car factories.
But I do believe that the anti-China tariffs are a temporary situation at best. Those automakers will be selling EVs and hybrids in America someday; capitalism finds a way, even their flavor of it. America just needs to figure out what terms that's going to happen on.
We know that Japan's automakers are freaked out about their lateness in developing EV technology, and the rise of China is what has them especially spooked. We also know that they're circling the wagons and turning to joint ventures and team-ups to stay ahead.
The latest one is a deal between Honda and Nissan, but these days, the former is in a much stronger position in terms of profits and sales than the latter. So former Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi megaboss Carlos Ghosn—speaking to Automotive News from self-imposed exile in Lebanon following his flight from Japanese authorities—worries that Nissan is just going to get eaten here:
""Signing an alliance is the easy part. Now, making the alliance work is a completely different story,"" Ghosn told Automotive News on Aug. 5 from Lebanon, where he lives as a fugitive from Japanese authorities after jumping bail in December 2019 and fleeing the country hidden in a box.
Indeed, many details of the Nissan-Honda deal, including funding and investment, are up in the air. Meanwhile, adding Mitsubishi to the mix brings another voice that could complicate discussions.
[...] ""I can't imagine for one moment how it's going to work between Honda and Nissan unless it's a takeover, unless it's a disguised takeover by Honda of Nissan and Mitsubishi with Honda in the driver's seat,"" Ghosn said. ""It's going to be a takeover, a disguised takeover.""
Nissan and Honda haven't discussed capital cross-holdings between each other, Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida and Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said at their joint news conference.
But Mibe added that he isn't ruling it out.
The partners are considering many options, perhaps even setting up a new company, the Honda boss added. Honda took that approach in establishing a separate EV venture with electronics and tech giant Sony.
Ghosn is right about the culture clash. They may both be Japanese car companies, but they're very different ones. One is an engineering-led firm that's been largely independent and has had few tie-ups over the years, and the other is infamous for its bureaucracy, inconsistent decisions and utter chaos since the Ghosn scandal. And Nissan's ties to Renault are equally messy, with fewer obvious returns for either company.
Again, I do think this is the start of an era of consolidation for the Japanese auto industry, with Honda and Nissan on one side and Toyota, Subaru and Mazda on the other. But Nissan's not going into this one from a position of strength at all.
Second Gen Rivian R1T and R1S
We didn't get a ton of new-news out of Rivian's Q2 earnings call last night. But as CNBC reports, it beat analyst expectations yet still lost $1.46 billion—up from $1.2 billion a year earlier. Rivian officials also said the comoany remains on track for a positive gross profit during the fourth quarter.
More from that report:
The second-quarter results come more than a month after Rivian held an investor day that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software. The event came days after Rivian announced plans for Volkswagen to invest up to $5 billion in the EV startup, starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.
Shares of Rivian are off 37% this year amid slower-than-expected demand for EVs as well as Rivian’s significant cash burn. The stock closed Tuesday at $14.80, up 1.3%.
Rivian, which is still losing thousands of dollars for every vehicle it makes, has been focused on reducing costs. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in June that efficiencies earlier this year in products and manufacturing are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming “R2” vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026.
In other words, Rivian is learning, getting better and seems to be trending in the right direction. But it needs to keep the juice going until the R2 can make its debut, and 18 months (if not more) can feel like forever in the EV world.

Are 51% Of Tesla Buyers Switching Back To Gas? Absolutely Not.,https://insideevs.com/news/729112/edmunds-tesla-trade-ins-debunked/,A recent story suggested that over half of Tesla owners trade into gas cars. That's not true.,8/5/2024 16:37,"EV skeptics rejoiced at recent data from Edmunds, which claimed that over 50% of Tesla buyers were trading in their EVs for gas cars. There's just one problem with that stat: It's not true. Or more specifically, it's far from a complete picture.
Edmunds has a lot of great data, and it's a highly reputable source for new car transaction data and car testing data. We rely on all of it very regularly here. But their sales data has one core limitation: It comes from traditional car dealerships and only covers trade-ins.
As EIC Patrick George already explained in a recent story, anyone who knows Tesla knows why that data can't fully capture Tesla owner behavior. Tesla doesn't have dealerships.
EV Loyalty
Many early adopters have proven stunningly loyal to EVs. But as the products are reaching a wider audience, more people are saying they'd be interested in going back to a gas car. That trend is real, but not nearly as broad as some people have claimed.
Tesla sells its vehicles through directly owned company stores, which aren't included in Edmunds' dataset. We noted that the sample missed Tesla owners who switched to new Teslas, as well as those who replaced their cars with Rivians, Lucids or even VinFasts, all of which are sold outside of dealer networks.
Now, a new video from our friends at EV Buyers Guide expands on our intuition, showing data from S&P Global that captures a wider section of the market. It used new vehicle registration data along with data about when a car is no longer registered to an address, giving it a picture of the market that includes Tesla shoppers who buy another Tesla, those who have their cars totaled and get something else without trading in and those who sell or buy their next vehicle privately.
In short: It's the full picture. And it's a lot rosier for EV fans.
The first thing that sticks out is how much Edmunds misses by not including Tesla's store data. A whopping 70% of Tesla owners simply get another Tesla, an incredible loyalty figure. Another 10% buy other EVs, Rivian winning 9.8% of those customers who switch.
Just 13% of buyers traded their Teslas in for gas cars. Of the remaining buyers, 4% get hybrids, 2% get plug-in hybrids and 1% get diesels.
That's a far cry from the 51% number, which is what the Edmunds data suggested. It also includes buyers switching to brands like Ram or Aston Martin, which don't really make the same types of vehicles that Tesla does.
But there's a caveat to this data, that makes it worth watching the whole video. As Alex explains, the vast majority of Tesla sales have happened in the last few years, as the brand has transitioned from a niche player to a dominant juggernaut. That may have weird effect on the data, as Alex explains.
But while the data has its own limitation, one thing is clear: Most Tesla buyers aren't going back to gas cars. Don't get it twisted.

Why Mercedes Is Copying BMW's Homework On Future EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/729055/mercedes-bmw-ev-strategy/,"The ""jellybean"" thing didn't work out for Mercedes. Plus, Lucid and Rivian report their finances soon and Ford makes bank on fleet trucks.",8/5/2024 10:00,"When automakers kicked off their electric vehicle arms race a few years ago, their plans ran on a lot of assumptions. One of the biggest was that customers would just show up for EVs like they have for their other cars—loyal Audi owners would buy Audi EVs, Mercedes owners would buy Mercedes EVs, and so on. But many of them neglected to think that their EVs would have to be actually good for customers to make that leap.
Now, they're looking to adjust their plans as the EV takeoff wasn't as direct as they expected, and Mercedes is a perfect example. That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and industry news. Also on deck today: Rivian and Lucid prepare to report Q2 earnings and Ford's ""dirty"" secret when it comes to profits. Let's go.
2024 Merceds G 580 With EQ Technology First Drive -- Electric G-Class
Like I said, the EV transition was built on assumptions. (The other big one was that the EV charging infrastructure would just kind of ""show up"" around these cars like the gas station network once did, but that wasn't the case, so now the automakers are doing it themselves in various ways.)
Mercedes made some wrong assumptions about the EQ-branded EVs. They're not all bad, of course—the range on some of them is excellent, the Hyperscreen is rad and I'm weirdly partial to the EQE sedan—but their super-aerodynamic ""jellybean"" style hasn't delivered the kind of presence and stateliness that Mercedes buyers expect. And cars like the EQS just don't feel as nice or as premium as a proper S-Class, somehow.
So the plan moving forward is to eventually phase out the special, standalone EQ cars and do more vehicles like the new G-Class: same body but in gas or electric form.
As Automotive News points out today, that's basically what BMW is doing too. It offers gas, electric and hybrid versions of many of its most popular cars, along with some standalone versions of each like the iX, XM or M3, to give some examples. Here's more:
Mercedes-Benz is bringing 25 new and updated models to showrooms this year, including entry and midsegment vehicles such as the redesigned E-Class and new plug-in hybrid GLC crossover.
The automaker is backing off its electric vehicle push as U.S. consumers cool to its zero-emission offerings.
At a meeting in April, Mercedes told retailers it would boost combustion engine and hybrid vehicle supply in 2024. The automaker plans to expand its plug-in hybrid offerings in the second half with the GLC.
The automaker is tweaking product development plans and taking a page from rival BMW. Future models will share platforms and support gasoline-only, hybrid and electric powertrains. Mercedes will ditch the jelly bean design and EQ branding on future EVs.
But this doesn't mean Mercedes is abandoning EVs, as some outlets have implied. There's a new electric cargo van coming, a high-performance AMG model, the new ""electric first"" CLA-Class family and more. Meanwhile, a number of EQ models will be updated and conventional cars like the E-Class and S-Class are getting hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains, if they don't have them already.
The plan certainly worked well for BMW, which has a higher EV share of sales than most and gives loyal customers other options too. No reason it can't work for Mercedes either.
Lucid-Rivian
Overall, the second quarter wasn't exactly spectacular for most automakers. While several posted more strong EV sales, car sales, in general, are down as interest rates remain high and the companies themselves face steep capital ramp-up costs—or are scrambling to fix various quality issues.
So how will the startups stack up? Lucid's earnings call is this evening and Rivian's is tomorrow and we'll be covering both. Lucid is coming off a record sales quarter, but it's still dogged by enormous costs that will keep profits well on the horizon for now. We may hear more about the Gravity SUV, expected to be a much bigger volume-seller than the Air sedan.
As for Rivian, it has said that it expects to be ""gross profit positive"" by Q4 of 2024, but we'll learn more about that trajectory soon. Rivian's shares were bolstered by the big investment and tech joint venture with Volkswagen, but that's going to be a long-term play and probably not something that yields immediate, overnight returns.
More on both stories as we learn more.
Ford Pro EV charging
Ford is fairly unique among automakers because it breaks out financial results for its EV division separately from its gas and commercial divisions. That's made it a bit of a punching bag for investors, who want profits and returns right now, but any EV supply chain and production system is going to take time and money to build out—investors love Tesla and it burned cash there for well over a decade.
But Ford has a secret weapon that's both paying the bills and keeping its EV division afloat: the Ford Pro commercial division, CNBC reports:
But Ford has proven that’s not always the case by breaking out financial results for its “Ford Pro” fleet business. The operations have raked in about $18.7 billion in adjusted earnings and $184.5 billion in revenue since 2021.
Such results have led Wall Street to praise the business, as analysts have called it a “hidden gem” and Ford’s “Ferrari,” referring to the highly profitable Italian sports car manufacturer.
Automakers, including Ford, also see fleet operations as a key driver in other ways, including for electric vehicle sales, as well as reoccurring revenue options such as software and logistical services.
“This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency,” [CEO Jim] Farley said during the quarterly call. “The major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro.”
This is interesting for a few reasons. For one, EVs are a big part of these commercial plans, as are traditional gas-powered vans and trucks. And General Motors and Stellantis are jealous, so they're trying to ramp up similar commercial operations as well:
Unlike retail customers, many fleet and commercial customers have predefined routes or schedules that could accommodate EVs well because they drive locally in a region and could charge overnight when electricity costs are lower.
All three of the legacy Detroit automakers are touting such advantages to their fleet customers, while still offering traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.
Stellantis and Ford also have started highlighting their portfolios of different powertrains such as hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as adoption of EVs has not occurred as quickly as many had expected.
Ford last month announced plans valued at about $3 billion to expand Super Duty production, including to “electrify” Super Duty trucks.
“We’ve gone to, on all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform so we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have,” Farley said during the earnings call. “We believe we will be a first mover, if not the first mover, in multi-energy Super Duty.”
But all of them know that if they can't get consumer-focused EVs right—and profitable—the commercial truck and van business might be all they do someday.

Why A Failed Startup’s Cheap EVs Are Piling Up In This Junkyard,https://insideevs.com/news/728795/electrameccanica-solo-junkyard-arizona/,Remember the ElectraMeccanica Solo? This is its final resting place.,8/2/2024 7:49,"With a driving range of around 100 miles on a full charge, a body smaller than the ill-fated Smart ForTwo and just three wheels, the ElectraMeccanica Solo EV was touted as the solution to boring commutes. The company’s CEO, Jerry Kroll, even went as far as saying that the diminutive battery-powered city runabout would be “as ubiquitous as the iPhone within a year.”
That was in 2018. Now, The majority of Solo EVs are ending up in an Arizona scrapyard, as @startupslick on TikTok recently discovered (and was then covered by The Autopian). But why?
Solo if you choose to keep your Solo
ElectraMeccanica's voluntary buyback program for the 429 Solo EVs affected by an issue that could lead to a loss of motive power is just that: voluntary. That means you could still see third-gen Solos pop up for sale from people who wanted to keep them instead of selling them back to the manufacturer. That said, if you plan on buying one, be aware that there's no support whatsoever from its maker.
The short answer is that the company started a voluntary buyback program for 429 units which could suddenly lose motive power. Why didn’t they just do a normal recall, like car companies usually do? Well, ElectraMeccanica didn’t actually know how to fix the issue, so they chose to buy back the affected three-wheelers from their owners.
And it’s these units that ended up the the Arizona junkyard you see in the TikTok video embedded below. According to the uploader, who said he talked to a scrapyard employee, the EVs can’t be parted out–except for the seats–so their fate will ultimately be the crusher.
ElectraMeccanica actually built more units than the 429 that were part of the voluntary buyback program and even got to the delivery part, which is usually the most difficult one to undertake if you’re a startup.
The single-seaters that are piling up in the junkyard were built in China by ElectaMeccanica’s strategic investor, Zongshen Industrial Group, which assembled another 300 units prior to starting U.S. deliveries, but those EVs were reportedly scrapped, according to Robert Dunn of Aging Wheels, who owns two Solos.
The company unveiled the production model in 2016 and a year later, limited (hand-built) production began in Vancouver, Canada. About 180 of these first-gen models were assembled but just about 40 or so reached customers, according to various reports online. Then, in 2019, production of the second-gen version began in China–those 300 or so units that weren’t actually sold, with the third-gen model finally hitting the assembly line in 2021.
ElectraMeccanica Solo Ev 8
Deliveries in the U.S. started in the same year, but even if the issue that led to the recall and subsequent buyback had been fixed, the Solo EV was a tough pill to swallow from the get-go. With a starting price of $18,500 and an interior that looked like the Fisher Price version of a Chevrolet Spark–not to mention it could only seat one person–it wasn’t a particularly attractive deal.
As for why didn’t ElectraMeccanica fix the cars instead of scrapping them, it’s unclear, but it could have to do with the fact that the brand was purchased by electric truck company Xos, which seemingly doesn’t want to have anything to do with the ill-fated three-wheelers.
In a response to an email sent by The Drive, a Xos representative said: “Following the recall, buyback, and ElectraMeccanica’s cessation of sales, the vehicles were disposed of partly via the facility in [the] linked video. Following the acquisition by Xos, ElectraMeccanica's few remaining operations have been wound down.”
It’s worth noting that you could still see some third-gen Solo EVs pop up for sale once in a while, seeing how the buyback was voluntary, but if you’re trying to convince yourself that it’s a good deal, bear in mind that there’s absolutely no support from the factory anymore.
In other words, you’d be solo in your adventure.

"Yes, Electric Vehicles Are Cheaper In 2024. Here's How Much",https://insideevs.com/news/728237/ev-cheaper-critical-materials/,"But automakers face all kinds of financial headwinds for different reasons. Plus, the Honda Prologue gets a recall already.",7/29/2024 10:30,"I think it's fair to say that the Inflation Reduction Act—the Biden Administration's omnibus spending bill aimed at clean energy, infrastructure, health care reform and much more—has had its share of headaches when it comes to driving electric vehicle sales.
Few people understand the tax incentive scheme for EVs and plug-in hybrids, chargers and battery factories take years to build out, and the roster of eligible cars changed so much in 2024 alone that updating the list kept us pretty busy here at InsideEVs.
But when it comes to reducing EV buying costs, guess what? It's working.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of what's new in the world of tech, transportation and our pivot to an electrified future. Also on deck: car companies faced financial headwinds in Q2 of 2024 for different reasons, and the Honda Prologue faces a recall you may want to know about.
2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium
One mark against EV adoption is that, so far, the cars have just been more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts. There are many reasons for that, but it generally comes down to the still-high cost of batteries and the fact that EVs depend on supply chains that aren't nearly as built out as the ones powering gas cars for the past century.
But the IRA is moving the needle in the right direction, according to an Automotive News report from earlier in July that I missed but is worth highlighting here. And as many automakers (but certainly not all) see record EV sales, they have both EV tax credits and leasing loopholes to thank for pushing wider adoption:
[The IRA] has spurred investment plans amounting to billions of dollars in domestic EV assembly plants, battery factories and materials mines.
As it turns out, limits on buyer income and EV sourcing requirements have not raised what consumers, on average, are paying for the vehicles.
Compared with the first quarter of 2022—prior to the legislation—average transaction prices fell $8,600 to $57,584 for purchases in the same period of this year, according to data from J.D. Power. The average transaction price includes legacy automotive brands and Tesla. The average lease transaction price slid $5,900 to $33,553.
There are other reasons, too, like Tesla sparking a price cut war last year that spread nearly across the board. But the leasing loophole in particular—which nets a $7,500 discount via a tax credit at the point of sale—is really pushing things:
On EV leases, one feature of the legislation allowed the tax credit to pass through without sourcing and assembly requirements. The Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit allows lessors — automaker finance arms and other lenders — to pass along the $7,500 credit in a lease, which is considered a commercial transaction. The result is that more consumers can tap the tax credit when leasing, saving them about $1,900 in the transaction price.
EV lease penetration for non-Tesla models typically hovers above 60 percent and stretches to about 90 percent for some Audi and BMW models.
""It is the loophole. You don't have to worry about your income bracket, the MSRP, where the battery minerals were produced,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. ""I think it will continue.""
The problem is that car companies are getting nervous both because they (and their dealers) are taking losses to drive sales. And the IRA incentives are very much up in the air depending on the election results; former President Donald Trump has vowed to end them if re-elected, even as they drive huge investments even in red states like Hyundai's $7.6 billion EV and battery complex in Georgia.
So what happens if all of that goes away? That will be the $200 billion question voters will have to ask themselves as they go to the polls;. However, it's unclear what a potential Harris Administration would do differently here than the Biden Administration; we can all presume the policies won't be that dissimilar.
Ford F-150 Lightning
Let's be real: Q2 wasn't a great one for the automotive industry. Sure, loss related to EV production is part of that, but the biggest problem has been high interest rates. Those have thwarted sales of things like big trucks and SUVs that carmakers really depend on for profits.
There are also automaker-specific problems, like Tesla's aging lineup (and other matters) slowing down sales, Ford's sky-high warranty costs amid a long-running quality crisis, or Stellantis' sinking Jeep sales... it's a lot right now.
However, the Wall Street Journal points out something I strongly agree with: people are just sick of the crazy new car prices, which jumped heavily during and after the pandemic. New cars that cost $50,000 on average are fine when interest rates are nearly zero, but not when they hover around 8%:
One particular concern among auto investors has grown louder: The strong pricing power that carmakers have enjoyed in the pandemic era is slowly fading. Several auto executives warned that in the second half of the year, they expect the average price paid by customers will edge lower.
“The results of our competitors are not demonstrating that price pressure is going to vanish,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, which also makes Ram vehicles.
Car companies for years have made the case that they are ready to become technology companies, with plans to transform cars into battery-powered smartphones on wheels. Those ambitions, coupled with an unprecedented run of profitability fueled by stout pricing, lifted stocks.
Wall Street’s enthusiasm for that vision has faded, as U.S. electric-vehicle demand hasn’t taken off as expected. Now, with signs that pricing is losing steam as the American car buyer grapples with high interest rates, investors are looking for reasons to stick around.
“The overarching feeling for the auto industry is that the good times can’t last,” said Martin French, managing director at auto consulting firm Berylls Strategy Advisors.
That's funny because I wouldn't exactly call the pandemic supply chain shenanigans of the early 2020s ""good times."" However, automakers are trying to sell Wall Street in the future, not in the present: EVs, autonomy, their approach to technology, and more.
“The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during his Q2 call last week. The same could be said of all of them.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite
It's only 39 units (for now), but if you bought a Honda Prologue recently, be advised your new GM-made EV is facing a recall. Here's the NHTSA to fill you in:
Honda (American Honda Motor Co.) is recalling certain 2024 Prologue vehicles. The right front lower control arm may contain a manufacturing defect that can cause it to fracture.
Dealers will inspect and replace the right front lower control arm as necessary, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed September 2, 2024. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. Honda's number for this recall is PIY.
Equinox EV Range
After driving the affordable Chevy Equinox EV, I'm feeling pretty good about GM's Ultium play—it's giving that company the scale it needs to build EVs across many brands at many price points for years to come. GM has also upped its software game considerably this year.
Who else is doing the hard work right now that will pay off tomorrow and beyond?

The Porsche Cayenne Is Going Electric. Just Not Entirely,https://insideevs.com/news/727932/porsche-cayenne-electric-teaser/,"The next generation Cayenne will be all-electric. But the current one is sticking around with some upgrades too, just in case.",7/25/2024 18:00,"For the first time, Porsche has officially shown off the fourth-generation Cayenne, albeit with heavy camouflage. But it's no secret that this time, it's also a rival to the likes of Tesla and Rivian when it goes on sale sometime in 2025 or 2026. But Porsche's also got a back-up plan of sorts if those buyers aren't ready to go fully electric.
Unlike the Porsche Macan, which now exists solely as an EV (some older gas units are still on sale in the U.S.), Porsche is taking no such risks with the Cayenne. That means adopting a multi-pronged approach by offering multiple powertrain options. That’s in line with industry trends as automakers recalibrate their EV plans after witnessing uneven sales growth and taking a massive beating in terms of profits.
The future of performance cars is electric too.
Electric motors leave gas engines in the dust when it comes to raw performance. We've seen Tesla Model S Plaids and Lucid Air Sapphires destroy even the most expensive gas powered supercars in a straight line. Porsche is going increasingly electric too. It first electrified the Macan and now has an all electric Cayenne in the pipeline.
“In the middle of the decade, the fourth generation will set standards in the segment as an electric SUV,” Oliver Blume, CEO of Porsche AG, said in a statement. “At the same time, into the next decade, our customers will still be able to choose from a wide range of powerful and efficient combustion and hybrid models.” The statement added that the current, third-generation Cayenne ""will be further upgraded and will continue to be offered alongside the fourth, all-electric generation.""
The automaker already sells plug-in hybrid and gas-powered Cayennes in the U.S., Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. In the U.S., the plug-in hybrid is available with both V6 (Cayenne E-Hybrid) and V8 (Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid) engines and has a WLTP range of 56 miles. Its EPA numbers are not available yet.
The Cayenne EV will ride on the same Premium Platform Electric (PPE) as other upscale Volkswagen Group electric models, such as the Macan EV and the Audi Q6 E-Tron. Both have gotten generally excellent reviews so far. Thanks to the PPE’s 800-volt architecture, the Macan EV can charge at 270 kilowatts and is capable of adding a 10-80% range in 21 minutes, so expect similar charging performance from the Cayenne EV, too.
That said, the teaser images don’t give away much, apart from the 911-like cooling ducts upfront and the fact that it retains a similar silhouette as the current gas-powered Cayenne.
However, the Cayenne EV is set to arrive at a time when Porsche is scaling back its once-ambitious EV plans. The automaker previously anticipated that electrified models would account for more than 80% of new car sales by 2030. But Porsche told Reuters this week that now depends on “consumer demand and development of electromobility.”
2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid.
Still, the Cayenne remains a crucial part of Porsche's journey. Porsche launched it in the early 2000s when its financials were ringing the alarm bells. Then the Cayenne arrived, offering buyers a luxurious, spacious, performance-focused and off-road capable family SUV. It prevented Porsche from spiraling downward again, generating profits that were reinvested in the company's indulgent sports car projects.
Over the years, along with the smaller Macan, it has played a big role in keeping Porsche’s balance sheets looking healthy. Now Porsche hopes that the electric model will herald another new era for the brand, similar to how the gas model did back in 2002.

EVs Left These Owners Stranded. But Not For Why You Think,https://insideevs.com/news/727893/evs-owners-stranded-tech-battery/,"Running out of battery power seems like an obvious reason, but that’s not what left owners stranded.",7/25/2024 10:26,"Stranded electric vehicles? Must be the battery running out of charge, right? For many, that’s the knee-jerk reaction, an Olympics-style jump to the seemingly obvious conclusion. However, a new study reveals the myriad reasons why EV owners might find themselves stranded.
Toronto-based digital platforms company VerticalScope, the parent company of AutoGuide and other publications, surveyed 1,200 EV owners in a recent poll. It concluded that 9.1% of the respondents were stranded, but the reasons why say more about technology than range.
EVs have some quality issues, but they're improving
EVs are a technological leap. And with that comes a steep learning curve for automakers as they iron out software issues to make ownership seamless. Rivian, GM and many others are already improving their model line-ups with substantial under-the-skin upgrades after early bugs.
Let's first note that this is a relatively small sample size, much smaller than studies conducted by the likes of J.D. Power or Recurrent. So it may not be indicative of broader industry trends, especially now that EVs are starting to fly off the shelves. And as we've covered before, getting stranded in an EV can happen but is vastly less widespread than many people think.
Still, the findings seem somewhat consistent with what we’ve seen before.
The most common issue was purely mechanical, emerging from suspension, drivetrain components or cooling systems required for large batteries. 6.4% of owners reported these problems. 2.1% of owners said they faced software issues.
This has been a recurring theme in the early days of the EV transition. As opposed to traditional gas cars where mechanical systems play the primary role, EVs follow a software-first approach. All major systems in modern EVs (and even gas cars) are controlled by software.
A software issue left us stranded in a Chevy Blazer EV during a road trip last year.
This includes the drivetrain, battery management systems, advanced driver assistance systems, over the air updates and more. Making all that work flawlessly isn’t easy. Many automakers have witnessed a steep learning curve here, including Volkswagen, Rivian and General Motors.
Only 0.6% of the respondents said they were left stranded due to running out of range. That’s only about 7.2 people in a sample size of 1,200, so clearly, people are getting better at planning, charging is getting better and running an EV completely down to 0% is quite rare.
Even though range anxiety is real, it’s not what seems to be causing trouble for EV owners. And it’s almost a non-issue considering that the average daily driving distance for Americans is only 42 miles according to one estimate. Several new EVs now offer a range of over 300 miles.
The study adds that Tesla and BMW fared better than others. Just 7% of Tesla owners and 5% of BMW owners reported getting stranded. None of the Tesla owners faced software issues. Owners of GM vehicles, like the old Chevy Bolt EV and Silverado EV and GMC Hummer EV, as well as Fisker and Nissan owners, faced the most trouble.

Stellantis Is ‘Ready For The Fight’ Against Chinese EVs In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/727678/stellantis-fight-chinese-evs-europe/,"With a new EV production line at the former Yugo factory in Serbia, the auto giant reckons it has what it takes. Will it succeed?",7/24/2024 13:00,"The last time we checked, Stellantis had at least 14 car brands under its wings and even more subsidiaries scattered throughout the globe. But even with so much potential power, it–like many other automakers–has struggled to keep up with the influx of Chinese-made electric cars making their way into Europe.
According to Reuters, CEO Carlos Tavares said that the company is “ready to fight” the brutal challenge of the Chinese EV offensive.
Local lithium and cheap workforce
With a new EV assembly line in Serbia and a local supply of lithium, the vital component needed for high-voltage batteries, Stellantis reckons it has what it takes to fight the influx of Chinese-made electric cars making their way into Europe—that, and the fact that it is also assembling a Chinese-made EV in Poland.
""We are going to be challenged and I would say brutally challenged by the Chinese offensive on the European market,"" Tavares said on Monday during the opening of a new EV production line in Serbia which will assemble the new Fiat Grande Panda sub-compact crossover. ""At Stellantis, we are ready for the fight,"" he added.
More Stellantis Stories
The former Yugo plant, which used to build the Fiat 500L minivan, is a key part of Stellantis’ fight with the influx of Chinese-made EVs, which are sometimes cheaper than European-made ones. Production costs are lower at the Serbian Kragujevac factory than in Poland, France and Italy. This, coupled with the country’s recent reinstatement of a mining license to develop Europe’s biggest lithium mine, will help keep the selling price down–as low as $28,000 in the case of the Fiat Grande Panda.
""We are going to demonstrate to them that ... we are hard-working, we are going to demonstrate to them that we have the right technology, we are going to demonstrate to them that we are a very fierce competitor,"" Carlos Tavares said.
That “fierce competitor” attribute can also be interpreted with the help of the old saying, “If you can’t beat them, join them.” That’s because earlier this year, Stellantis, through its joint venture with Leapmotor, started assembling a Chinese-made EV at its factory in Tychy, Poland. The Leapmotor T03 is a city car that costs around $21,000 to $24,000 and comes with a 41.3-kilowatt-hour battery and single electric motor that makes either 94 horsepower (70 kilowatts) or 107 hp (80 kW), depending on the trim. The WLTP-rated range is 174 miles on a full charge.
By comparison, the Fiat Grande Panda, based on the same platform as the Citroen e-C3, features a 113 hp front motor paired with a 44 kWh battery for a claimed range of 195 miles, presumably on the WLTP cycle. A mild-hybrid model will also be available, powered by a 1.2-liter gasoline engine making around 100 hp.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s Why Rivian’s Partnerships With Ford And Mercedes-Benz Fell Apart,https://insideevs.com/news/727524/rivian-ford-mercedes-benz/,"It had nothing to do with electric motors or batteries. And now with Volkswagen, Rivian reckons it has the winning ticket.",7/23/2024 9:29,"Only a couple of years ago, it seemed like global heavyweights Ford and Mercedes-Benz would end up tight with California-based EV startup Rivian. The maker of the all-electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV was just getting started, but many assumed it would've had at least two platform-sharing projects with those two old-school titans.
Ford aimed to use Rivian’s skateboard platform for a Lincoln model and a blue oval-branded EV. At the same time, the partnership with Mercedes-Benz was meant to produce at least two battery-powered vans at an existing factory in Europe. Both deals fell through, however, leaving Rivian to move forward on its own regarding manufacturing. Ford and Mercedes-Benz also went their own ways.
Platform-sharing is harder than it seems
There's often talk of platform-sharing between car companies as a simple solution to filling certain market gaps. But while simple badge-engineering jobs like the Ram ProMaster EV (which is just a rebadged Fiat) are simple enough, making a brand-new car using bits from a different company isn't exactly a walk in the park, as Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe explained during an interview with The Verge.
Now we know why those partnerships ended because the startup’s CEO, RJ Scaringe, spilled the beans during a lengthy interview with The Verge’s Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel for the Decoder podcast.
In short, it had nothing to do with engineering constraints such as trying to fit the body of a Ford or Mercedes-Benz on top of a Rivian chassis–which is no small feat in itself. Instead, it was all about trying to make all the different computers talk to each other, which, as it turned out, was a deal-breaker.
“We looked at vehicle platform sharing with Ford, vehicle platform sharing with Mercedes, both very publicly,” Scaringe said. “What is, in every case, always the challenge is getting the network architectures of Rivian’s platform and those other manufacturers that we’ve talked to to work together,” he added.
The California company’s founder and head honcho said that it’s a challenge to get two very different architectures to run down the same manufacturing line and that the biggest technical boundary was network architecture.
“It’s a challenge in every possible way. It’s a challenge to get the top hat from a traditional company that’s using lots and lots of supplier source ECUs to work with our platform–battery, drivetrain, chassis that has very few ECUs,” Scaringe said about the constraints.
There might have been also factors at play, such as financials, but the CEO didn’t get into these details. Instead, he focused on the electrical architecture struggles. That’s why when the new deal with Volkswagen came along, the main talking point was precisely “the thing that has always been the challenge.”
As a reminder, VW is investing up to $5 billion in the American EV maker to help it overcome the software-related black spots that came after years of delays and mishaps caused by its own software subdivision known as Cariad.
The two companies will not jointly develop EVs in the traditional way. Instead, Rivian will offer its electrical architecture know-how to make it easier for Volkswagen to manufacture EVs that offer a hassle-free user experience.
""We’ll provide the topology of the ECUs, along with the base operating system. That’s both for the infotainment platform and the real-time operating system. There’s a few different operating systems we’ve built, and then everything around over-the-air updates and connectivity,"" Scaringe told The Verge.
On the other hand, Ford seems to be going its own way to the same end goal, developing a skunkworks program out in California staffed by veterans from Tesla, Apple and yes, Rivian. That program will hopefully yield a new, low-cost EV architecture to power a possibly $25,000 electric truck and crossover. As for Mercedes-Benz, it's actually scrapping a next-generation EV platform and seems to be refocusing on internal combustion. Perhaps it will end up wishing it had made a Rivian deal work out.

The Rivian R3X Will Be Next To Arrive After The R2: CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/727482/rivian-r3x-release-scaringe/,"""Then we’ll bring in base R3 after R3X,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a podcast. He also dove deep into Rivian's Volkswagen partnership.",7/22/2024 15:00,"You loved the Rivian R3X, right? Of course you did—you have two eyes and a heart, don't you? Rivian's upcoming compact performance crossover, inspired by classic 1980s hot hatchbacks and rally cars, broke the internet when it made its surprise debut earlier this year. Of course, it's unfortunately years away from being released. But now we have more information about where the R3X will stand in Rivian's new pecking order.
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe offered up new details about the R3X in a wide-ranging interview with The Verge's Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel for the latter's Decoder podcast. That podcast is absolutely worth a listen in full, as is reading the transcript if that's more your jam; it's one of the more extensive interviews Scaringe has done as of late on the heels of some developments that have made 2024 Rivian's most promising year to date.
Rivian's journey from startup to stable
Rivian shows tremendous promise as an EV startup and technology company, but like many, it has yet to turn a profit. Getting mainstream models like the R2 and R3 on the road will help, but Rivian plans to make its R1 models profitable by Q4 2024 as well.
Rivian, as you may know, is extremely hot right now. The updated R1S and R1T are on sale now with significant improvements under the skin that could make them profitable electric models by the end of this year. The R1S is now one of the top-selling EVs in the country, and the bestselling premium vehicle EV and the best-selling large SUV (agnostic of what powers it) in California. The startup received considerable hype for its new R2 and R3 models, and that only skyrocketed when it announced a new partnership to develop electric architectures with Volkswagen.
So this Decoder podcast is a must-listen, because Scaringe tells us a lot of things we hadn't heard before. Especially of note is the fact that after the R2 is released in the first half of 2026 (if all goes according to plan, of course) the R3X will come next. No solid date yet, but we do get some new details.
""It’s probably the car that we get the most questions about, and I mean the packaging on it is just exceptional,"" Scaringe said. ""As soon as we possibly can, but we’re not giving a date. So, what we’re doing with this new platform is we’re launching R2 first, allowing some time to get that stable, and then launching R3. I will say this: The first R3 that we’re launching, it’s going to start with R3X, and then we’ll bring in base R3 after R3X.""
He added, ""We all want so bad [to] get the R3X in as soon as possible,"" indicating the people in the company share the excitement over the model. No specs have been released either, but we know it will use the R2's new lower-cost platform; offer a tri-motor configuration standard; and should pack at least 300 miles of range and a Tesla-style NACS plug from the factory. And with three electric motors and more ground clearance than the R3, it should be an incredible performance machine.
Scaringe also elaborated on how the Volkswagen joint venture will work. While some details of that arrangement remain to be seen, but Rivian is getting up to $5 billion to help Volkswagen get past its longtime struggles with software and electrical architectures. (It's doing a similar partnership with XPeng for EVs in China.)
""What we’re providing is that architecture,"" Scaringe said. ""We’ll provide the topology of the ECUs, along with the base operating system. That’s both for the infotainment platform, but also for the real-time operating system. There’s a few different operating systems we’ve built, and then everything around over-the-air updates and connectivity.""
But forget new VWs operating just like Rivians on the software side, and vice-versa. ""What we won’t be providing is our user interface,"" Scaringe said. ""In all the different products this platform will go into, the user interface is actually an abstraction at the top of the stack. A vehicle may have three screens, it may have two screens, it may have 10 screens. That’s relatively simple to change what the UI looks like, but everything underneath will be really heavily commonized using our architecture.""

Tesla Is Losing Ground In The U.S. And Europe: Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/727342/tesla-losing-us-europe/,"In the first half of 2024, Tesla's US sales fell eight percent. It's worse in Europe with a 13-percent drop.",7/21/2024 10:00,"It doesn't seem to be a good year for Tesla. After the record results of 2023—when it was the most popular EV manufacturer with the best-selling vehicle in the world—2024 isn't nearly as robust. The latest data collected by JATO Dynamics for the first half of this year shows Tesla losing ground in both the United States and Europe, where sales fell by 8 percent and 13 percent respectively.
While the general public is not entirely enthusiastic about electric cars, overall demand has actually grown in both regions. New, more competitive models introduced on both sides of the Atlantic are attracting more people, despite growing uncertainty about incentives and the future plans of the OEMs that produce these cars.
A sales decline doesn't always mean a loss of market share, but that's not the case with Tesla. In Europe, the brand's volume fell from 185,200 units in the first half of 2023 to 161,300 units for the same period in 2024. However, during that same timeframe, total EV registrations increased by 1.7 percent.
This means Tesla's market share in the European BEV market fell from 19.8 percent to 17.2 percent this year. Tesla was the carmaker with the second-highest decline in BEV market share in Europe through the first six months of 2024, behind only the Volkswagen Group, which fell from 22 percent to 18.7 percent.
Tesla and Volkswagen lost ground to the Geely Group, which was boosted by the solid results of the Volvo EX30, and the BMW Group, which continues to reap success with its latest models. Chinese brands also grew, mainly thanks to BYD.
The situation in the United States is similar. Tesla's sales volume dropped from 324,900 units in the first half of 2023 to 299,200 units this year. Meanwhile, overall BEV sales increased by 7.6 percent in the same period. As a result, Tesla's share dropped from 59.8 percent in 2023 to 51.2 percent in 2024. The company is still a dominant player in its home market, but it's worth noting that numerous competitors posted strong gains amid Tesla's losses. Hyundai increased 34 percent, while Ford saw a 48 percent increase. Rivian was even better at 77 percent, and Kia managed a 110-percent jump.
The first reason for Tesla's decline is obvious. Growth can't continue forever, especially when the range is still limited and quite old. The Model 3 received a refresh in 2023 but it dates to 2017. The Model Y is already five years old, and the Model S goes way back to the early 2010s.
Tesla Model 3
Tesla Model Y
And the competition is coming on strong. In Europe, Tesla is feeling pressure from premium German brands and the Chinese industry. As mentioned previously, Ford, the Koreans, and Rivian are coming on strong in the US. The company's newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, hasn’t really taken off in terms of sales with just 11,300 sold in the US through the first half of 2024.
Finally, the price cuts that worked so well in 2023 aren't so attractive now. As more EVs come to market from other brands, increasing supply and selection effectively reduces demand and prices fall. At this point, Tesla needs more than just big discounts and attractive updates for its cars. It needs fresher products in more segments.

"Trump Hates EVs, But Welcomes China To Build Cars In The U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/727311/trump-evs-welcomes-china-make-cars-in-us/,The former President expressed a surprise openness to Chinese brands at this week’s Republican National Convention.,7/19/2024 18:41,"Former President Donald Trump’s unabashed opposition to electric cars isn’t new. The now-official Republican nominee and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, have waged a war on EVs. “The cars don’t go far enough. They’re very, very expensive. They’re also heavy,” Trump told Bloomberg recently. He’s also said that the auto industry would face a “bloodbath” from Chinese competition if he were not reelected. But at this week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump expressed a surprise openness to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S.
“Right now as we speak, large factories just are being built across the border in Mexico,” Trump said at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. He added, “Those plants are going to be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants.""
EVs are heavily politicized in the U.S.
Electric cars are a hot-button issue in the upcoming presidential elections. The Biden administration has spent hundreds of billions of dollars accelerating EV adoption. Former President Trump wants to ""end the EV mandate,"" when there's none to start with.
Those remarks come as a surprise to countless groups, from American auto industry officials who fear competition from China's advanced EVs all the way to fellow Republican lawmakers who have been intensely tough on the country and its ruling Chinese Communist Party government.
He implied that he would push to amend the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade deal and slap taxes as high as 200% on Mexican-made cars to prevent them from entering the U.S.
That would represent a sea change for the entire auto industry, given how many U.S.-market cars—electric and otherwise—are built in Mexico by General Motors, Ford, Mazda, Nissan, BMW and countless others.
That includes the new Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV, made at GM’s Ramoz Arizpe plant. BYD and Tesla both have plans to build plants in Mexico. There’s a real possibility that the Kia EV3, too, could be made there. Trump has a problem with that.
The Biden Administration has already imposed a hefty 100% tariff on Chinese car imports, effectively prohibiting them from selling in the U.S. at potentially predatory prices. But the ones made across the borders are free from tariffs.
BYD Shark - plug-in hybrid pickup (1)
The former President says a lot of things. Many of them are blatant lies. It’s one of the reasons newspapers employ full-time fact-checkers. So take his comments with a grain of salt. But Chinese carmakers would presumably be smiling at Trump’s comments.
The potential implications of that, especially in the context of how Japanese carmakers began conquering the U.S. car market in the 1980s by building local plants, are far too glaring to be ignored.
The first U.S.-made Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans rolled out decades ago and with them, they introduced hyper-efficient production processes that minimized errors on the assembly lines and maximized output. Years later, Japanese cars still reign supreme in the U.S. Toyota has been a top-selling U.S. brand in several categories, and nearly all Honda vehicles sold in America are built here as well.
Hypothetically, Chinese automakers too, would bring substantial expertise in building electric cars on American soil. Afterall, Chinese automakers and battery makers have been able to democratize and commercialize EVs better than any other country. They maintain an iron grip over battery processing and refining plants and some of the world’s largest battery makers are Chinese. Like CATL, for example.
And yet, in the same speech, Trump vowed to end the “electric vehicle mandate” on day one, if he were reelected. While the fact remains that there exists no “mandate,"" he referred to the EPA’s multi-pollutant emissions criteria finalized early this year. The EPA regulations require automakers to sell more plug-in cars to meet emissions targets aimed at preventing billions of tonnes of harmful gasses from entering the atmosphere.
At the same time, automakers are rolling back their deadlines on electrifying their fleets. So when you walk into a showroom years from now, you’ll likely have the option to choose from a gas car, conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid or a fully-electric model.
All said, it’s safe to say that American automakers employ a powerful group of lobbyists. If at all Trump greenlights Chinese automakers, the homegrown brands won’t sit quiet. They’ll likely do everything in their capacity to prevent that from happening. Will they succeed at that? Your guess is as good as mine.

Will Audi Still Go All-Electric By 2026? It's Staying 'Flexible.',https://insideevs.com/news/726706/audi-electric-2026-plan/,"“We have a perfect strategy to be flexible for the next 10 years,"" Audi's chairman told InsideEVs as it readies a new e-tron and gas sedan.",7/16/2024 5:00,"Car manufacturers the world over have said many things about their powertrain strategies. Broadly, many insist that the end of pure internal combustion is nigh and, after a quick dalliance with various takes on hybridization, everything will be electric (mostly). Audi’s messaging has been broadly along those lines, saying it will only introduce new combustion-powered cars up until 2026 followed by ""the gradual phasing out of production of vehicles with combustion engines by 2033.""
At least, that was the plan. The landscape is changing. People in power today say one thing about EVs, while in a few months, a new entity at the top can do an about-face. Take the UK and its reverse ferret on the so-called “ICE Ban,” which promised to end sales of un-electrified ICE vehicles from 2030 on but caused such a stir that it had to be punted back five years. In the U.S., the Biden Administration eased its tough standards to get to a zero-emission future more gradually. And other countries may be looking to follow suit or to relax stringent deadlines.
The Volkswagen Group's troubled EV transition
On the heels of its diesel cheating scandal, the Volkswagen Group announced its future would be all-electric. Since then, it's been dogged by countless software delays, uneven EV demand globally and a constantly shuffling deck of executives. Can it still execute this pivot?
Meanwhile, automakers are realizing this future will be harder and more expensive than they envisioned, and that it hinges on things they’re often very bad at at. Then there’s customer demand; if the money isn’t in BEV in the main it doesn’t make sense for a business to doggedly stick to a plan that’ll ultimately close it down. While EV sales hit new records in 2023 in the U.S. and 2024 is looking strong as well, that growth is hardly global, and when it does exist it's often on the backs of aggressive lease and financing deals.
All of this is to say: It's do-able, but easily the most difficult and unpredictable transformation any industry has ever undertaken.
Audi’s plan looked good from 30,000 feet, but with the above worries in mind, as well as reports of both ICE and hybrid engines carrying on in various states, we caught up with a man who could tell us exactly what was going on: The boss.
Speaking at the press preview of the new Audi A5, Q5 and A6 e-tron in Germany, Gernot Döllner, Chairman of the Board at Audi AG, had this to say: “We have a lot of debate, especially in Europe and North America regarding the speed of the transition from combustion engine to battery electric vehicle. We believe that to be able to reach decarbonization targets, electrification is the future.”
So far, so good, but then Döllner revealed the kicker: “We have a perfect strategy to be flexible for the next 10 years.”
“Flexible” is a fun word. It’s up there with your parents saying “maybe” when your childhood self asked them for a treat or toy of some sort. It buys wiggle room, and that may well be needed. After all, Audi is about to launch several new gas-powered models, including the all-important Q5 crossover; that may be before that previously planned 2026 cutoff date, but it's still going to stick around for a while.
Continuing, Döllner made no bones about Audi’s future, and the variety it’ll bring to the brand. “Nobody knows how fast the transition [from ICE to BEV] will be. And with the new models coming, we will have both a very strong renewed ICE and hybrid portfolio and a new battery electric portfolio. So we can proudly say that the Audi brand is flexible.”
Döllner went on to explain how the brand will make sure it has an EV offering across the board by 2027, and that Audi’s ICE lineup updates will be complete by the end of 2026. He continues with what could be read as a caveat though: “These new models will bring Audi to an excellent position, and we are able, as mentioned, to react flexibly to changes in the market…”
Later, during a Q&A, Döllner elaborated on the current plans AND the wiggle room. He stated that there’s an “endpoint [for ICE] defined for Europe, and that’s 2033,” which seems pretty definitive. Audi’s number of ICE cars will steadily reduce as time goes on as it lines itself up for a battery-powered future, but then the F-word appeared again. “We are flexible. We’re now bringing an all-new lineup of ICE cars, and so in two to three years… is a point when we’ll have to take the decision on if we only have this generation we’ve just started, or if we then add on. Which is good, and gives us the flexibility to react.”
It's not like Audi isn't taking the electric fight lying down, of course. It just debuted the Q6 and SQ6 e-tron, arguably its most important products in decades, designed to compete in the ultra-tough midsize EV crossover segment. The e-tron GT and renamed Q8 e-tron just got significant updates, and more new electric models are coming too, like the A6 e-tron sedan and its Avant wagon counterpart. Expect some electric RS models soon as well. But some hard-out date for ICE vehicles? Well, that depends.
Here it’s noted that the European Union is reviewing its regulations on the matters of internal combustion in 2026, which could give Audi’s gas-powered offering a stay of execution for a spell longer. It’s looking like 2026 and 2027 are going to be crucial years for the people at the top of Audi’s decision-making trees.
For now, Döllner’s line seems firm: “We believe that battery electric vehicles will be the right answer for what’s coming, and we already had that strategy.”
That strategy, though, seems to be “flexible.”

VinFast Delays North Carolina EV Plant To 2028 Over 'Economic Headwinds' And Not Any Other Reasons,https://insideevs.com/news/726556/vinfast-north-carolina-delay-2028/,"The Vietnam-based startup automaker, already plagued with notorious reviews and scandals back home, is pushing back its U.S. factory.",7/14/2024 11:00,"It was supposed to be ""the crown jewel of VinFast’s global expansion."" Now, the Vietnamese auto startup's $4 billion electric vehicle factory near Raleigh, North Carolina will not open until 2028, despite originally slated to be operating this month. The automaker blames ""economic headwinds"" and uncertainty in ""the global EV landscape,"" but as with most things VinFast, there's more to the story than that.
On Friday evening, VinFast announced that it has ""made the strategic decision to adjust the timeline for the launch of its North Carolina manufacturing facility,"" pushing that target date back a full four years. Construction is currently on hold at the plant, which was said to one day build the three-row VinFast VF9 and five-seat VinFast VF8 electric SUVs.
VinFast is an ambitious but troubled EV startup
Vietnam is new to the world of making cars and VinFast represents its highest ambitions. However, critics say it may have attempted to expand globally too quickly without products that were truly competitive, and the company has been accused of various financial improprieties as well.
""We have adopted a more prudent outlook that is carefully calibrated to near-term headwinds, taking into full consideration the realities of market volatility and potential challenges,"" Madam Thuy Le, Chairwoman of VinFast's Board of Directors, said in a news release. ""Our robust long-term strategy and proven execution capabilities position us well to meet the evolving needs of the dynamic global EV market.""
While it's certainly true that the global EV transition is more complex, costly and difficult than most automakers and governments had anticipated, and demand is proving to be uneven worldwide, VinFast has faced more headaches than mere economic uncertainty. The automaker has faced a slew of negative early reviews, allegations of impropriety in its home country, an investor lawsuit in the U.S. and serious quality issues as it seeks to be a major player in the space.
VinFast emerged almost out of nowhere in recent years as the automotive arm of Vingroup, one of Vietnam's largest privately owned companies and a conglomerate with interests in smartphones, hospitals, hotels, retail and more. Founded in 2017, it originally made gas-powered cars with help from General Motors and BMW before pivoting to EVs. It has since attempted a rapid global expansion and is deploying a lineup of electric cars at a record-setting place.
Key to those ambitions is the U.S. market, which necessitated American production. The North Carolina factory was originally set to be a 995,500-square-foot facility aimed at bringing 7,500 jobs to the region in service of building 150,000 EVs per year. For such an ambitious plan, it was awarded some $1.2 billion in state and county incentives over the next few decades.
However, as the Carolina Journal noted in a report this spring, construction had been paused at the site after VinFast submitted a new plan to Chatham County's government in December indicating the site would be considerably smaller. This change of plans led the county to review the permit request. ""No construction is being done until this permit revision is issued,"" a county official said at the time.
Meanwhile, VinFast's sole offering currently for sale in the U.S., the VF8, has received unprecedentedly scathing reviews for a modern car. Critics dinged its ride quality, user experience, handling and price tag; InsideEVs' first drive test was merely headlined ""Yikes."" The company has since relied mostly on influencer and social media marketing to reach American buyers. Globally, it still claims to have delivered 12,058 vehicles in the second quarter of this year alone and is on target to more than double last year's sales to 80,000.
But that claim comes with some caveats. VinFast has been accused of ""selling"" most of its cars to a taxi service owned by Vingroup. And as InsideEVs reported earlier this year, some critics of the automaker in Vietnam have faced detention from the police, under a law that punishes those who ""infringe upon the interests of the state, organizations, and individuals.”
Still, VinFast continues to debut new models, including the electric $9,000 VF3 city car that first appeared at CES. The company is either beginning sales or starting its expansion into Thailand, the Philippines, Europe and the Middle East. But it's looking more and more like perhaps VinFast should've led with that vehicle and those markets before seeking to take the U.S. by storm.
That's going to be years away now, if it ever happens at all, especially since current U.S. rules prioritize incentives for EVs built in North America. Meanwhile, the taxpayers of North Carolina—who were also promised thousands of new manufacturing jobs—are the ones left in the lurch. As the Carolina Journal notes, the state's Transformative Job Development and Investment Grant ""has had a terrible track record"" with most incentive recipients pulling out of their agreements with the state.

Florida Has A Huge EV Market. It's Paying For Other States' Chargers Instead,https://insideevs.com/news/726295/florida-nevi-grants-ev-charging/,"Gov. Ron DeSantis once aimed to “strengthen” Florida’s EV infrastructure. Now it's denying federal charging funds, and the money is going elsewhere.",7/11/2024 15:00,"By the end of 2023, Florida’s roads were home to about 232,000 electric vehicles, making the Sunshine State the second-biggest EV market in the U.S. Chalk it up to low electricity costs, or abundant sunlight for solar energy, or even the huge luxury car market in cities like Miami. No matter the reasons, Florida’s electric car growth has been hailed as “a beacon of progress” by the nonprofit Electrification Coalition.
Not a bad outcome for a technology that’s often embroiled in bitter, partisan politics—especially in a state where the political climate is very different from other EV-heavy places like California and New York.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program
NEVI is a $5 billion program authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It allocates federal money to states for DC fast charging, which they then dole out to private companies who apply to build the chargers. The program has been criticized for how long the chargers have taken to install, but more and more NEVI-funded plugs are starting to appear nationwide.
But politics are coming for EVs in Florida. As the U.S. government aims to make unprecedented investments into charging networks that serve EV drivers, Florida is falling behind—a deliberate decision by state leaders.
Florida has yet to dole out any existing federal money allocated to the state to grow its DC fast-charging network, as multiple outlets have reported in recent weeks, including the Tampa Bay Times and Axios. The state has $198 million over five years earmarked for chargers under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, but not a single dollar has been distributed to private companies in the form of grants to install new EV plugs.
That means companies like ChargePoint, Tesla and even gas stations that wish to install chargers can’t do so with federal funding help in Florida, as they can in other states.
Instead, the Florida Department of Transportation produced a new website that, among other things, rails against “the groupthink culture that is the Biden Agenda”—as well as EVs themselves.
ChargePoint charging infrastructure
“Rather than focusing on ways to increase throughput and highway capacity, [the U.S. Department of Transportation] seeks to force people out of their cars in one way or another whether that be through reducing lanes or issuing regulatory mandates to force electric vehicles on American commuters,” the website reads.”Why would the government be so insistent on getting rid of one of the greatest inventions [sic] like the combustion engine?”
The site, “Roads Are Not For Politics,” includes a laundry list of culture-war issues that state officials claim are driven by the Biden Administration, including “COVID tyranny” and “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).”
But it also includes partisan-flavored criticism of EVs, citing the money Ford has lost building out its manufacturing base and what it calls “low consumer demand” despite a record sales year in 2023.
Florida DOT Website
“While the federal government's obsession with electric vehicles is increasingly becoming an obsession that help's [sic] China, Florida continues its all-hands-on-deck approach to fight back through court challenges and educating Floridians on these mandates, emphasizing the importance of ‘fuel freedom’ and consumer choice,” the site reads.
FDOT announced this new website in a statement filled with invective toward the Biden Administration from Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Unlike the federal government, under my leadership Florida's Department of Transportation is focused solely on transportation,"" DeSantis said. ""We listen to Floridians and meet their needs. Roads are not for politics.”
But if Florida shuns that federal money, the Sunshine State’s taxpayers are essentially funding EV chargers in other states, like California and New York, said Loren McDonald, the CEO of analytics firm EVAdoption.
A NEVI-funded charger opens in Kingston, New York.
“Florida residents have paid for NEVI via their federal taxes, so if Florida doesn’t use the money to build out charging infrastructure, then DeSantis is in essence cheating his own state’s residents of getting something in return for their tax payments,” McDonald said.
Meanwhile, would-be charging providers who want to serve Florida’s growing EV driver community are getting fed up.
The Charge Ahead Partnership—a coalition of businesses that includes gas station chains like Wawa and Buc-ee's, all eager to expand into the electric “fueling” market—has criticized Florida’s still-closed application process for NEVI funding. And Florida’s moves come at a time when the U.S. government has already been lambasted for the slow rollout of NEVI-funded chargers, the group said. (As InsideEVs has covered before, the DC fast-charger installation process is often hampered by the cumbersome local permitting process, which can vary wildly from community to community.)
Mercedes-Benz Charging Network
But FDOT spokesman Michael Williams defended the site’s claims in an email to InsideEVs and reiterated that the onus of building out charging will be on the private sector in Florida.
“Free enterprise, not federal mandates, are the driving force when any industry experiences growth,” Williams said. “Nothing prohibits the private sector from building out our nation’s charging network. With the total number of EVs on the road today constituting approximately 1% of all vehicles registered across the nation, ‘low consumer demand’ is an accurate statement.”
Besides the fact that the private sector is the one tasked with building out America’s charging networks, McDonald, from EVAdoption, said the statement is a mischaracterization of how our century-old car evolves as new technologies emerge.
“It will take 40+ years to replace most ICE vehicles on the road in the U.S.,” he said. “We are now at 290 million vehicles on the road in the US, and about 4.5 million of those are [EVs] and [plug-in hybrids.] A wide choice of EV models and high-volume production of EV models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have only emerged in the last few years.”
The hostility toward EVs and the NEVI program represents a strange reversal for DeSantis. In 2020, the governor touted an $8.6 million investment to “strengthen Florida’s electric vehicle infrastructure” and “improve Florida’s environment.” The state even drafted a fairly robust EV Infrastructure Master Plan in 2021 that anticipated aggressive growth and a network of chargers to serve it.
“Not only will these charging stations promote reduced emissions and better air quality, they will also improve mobility and safety for the ever-increasing number of Floridians that drive electric cars,” DeSantis said in a 2020 statement—a far cry from the “unscientific climate alarmism” that FDOT is decrying today.
Moreover, around the time former President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of electric vehicles, DeSantis—who was also vying for the GOP nomination before dropping out—vetoed bipartisan legislation that would’ve led the state to buy more of them.
Williams, the FDOT spokesperson, countered by saying “There has been no policy shift [under DeSantis] regarding EVs as FDOT believes all road users should be free to drive what they want, where they want, when they want. FDOT’s objection is to the Biden Administration’s desire to implement a California-style mandate that will ultimately force consumers to purchase EVs.”
The FDOT website still has a NEVI-related page describing the grant program, but it merely says ""Please monitor site for any updates."" So far, none have come.
Kia EV6 at an Electrify America fast charging station
Meanwhile, though it's taken a frustrating amount of time, NEVI-funded chargers are starting to open across the country. The first opened in Ohio last year, followed by 11 others in seven states. McDonald said that this week alone, Maryland released its first round of NEVI awards, which should eventually yield 23 charging sites in 15 counties across the state.
He said that Florida is the one playing politics here, including in ways that could deter EV owners from road-tripping to one of America’s top tourism destinations.
“It is also interesting that the responses you received don’t even mention charging infrastructure or NEVI, but rather just repeat DeSantis talking points about Biden mandates,” McDonald said. “Who is being political here? DeSantis is putting his personal politics and dislike of Biden ahead of what is actually in the best interest of the residents of the state of Florida.”
McDonald added, “This is just crazy.”

Are Half Of EV Owners Really 'Switching Back' To Gas? It's Complicated.,https://insideevs.com/news/726008/mckinsey-study-half-ev-buyers/,"A new McKinsey study is being used as ammo against EVs. In reality, the next wave of EV buyers need more help than they're getting.",7/10/2024 12:00,"You probably saw the headlines. According to a new survey, 46% of electric vehicle owners in America now say they intend to ""switch back"" to internal combustion-powered cars. This particular statistic from McKinsey & Company's newest Mobility Consumer Pulse survey has been cited far and wide as an example of how troubled the EV transition really is.
The results go against conventional wisdom in the automotive world: That once people go electric, they almost never go back. Is that sentiment really starting to change right as the auto industry aims to take EVs more mainstream?
Mainstream headaches for EVs
The next great growth area for EVs is said to be a more mainstream crowd: lower- and middle-income buyers, people who want practical everyday cars and total newcomers to the electric world. But they are experiencing a much tougher situation than comparatively more forgiving early Tesla owners faced, especially when it comes to range and public charging.
The reality is more complicated and nuanced than that, one of the study's authors told InsideEVs. And what the data proves, this author says, is that automakers, dealers and charging companies have a lot more work to do if they want to keep any sort of electric momentum going.
""It's important not to just get stuck on that headline,"" said Philipp Kampshoff, who leads McKinsey's Center for Future Mobility in the Americas. However, ""when I look at the data, I think it's a bit of a clear warning signal that we need to fix these issues quickly,"" he said.
The McKinsey study included a number of fascinating data points on what people think about autonomous driving functionalities, or whether they'd consider buying cars from China, or what they want from connected software features.
McKinsey Study Slide 1
But a question about whether EV owners were ""very likely"" to switch back to ICE vehicles—meaning, replacing them entirely and not just adding a second or third gas or hybrid car to the fleet, Kampshoff said—has gotten the largest amount of wider attention. ""We've gotten tons of inbound requests to talk about this one,"" he said.
Globally, around 29% of the survey respondents said they probably would not go electric next time.
All of those owners cited familiar pain points with modern EVs: problems finding working public chargers, an inability to charge at home for whatever reason and general range anxiety.
McKinsey Study Slide 2
Kampshoff said that the questionnaire went to about 36,000 people in 15 countries and that it was conducted in the last few months—meaning that it included a lot of new EV owners following a record year of global sales.
In the U.S., he said, that included about 4,000 respondents. In other words, only 1,840 people actually said they're likely to give up electric driving next time. That's a relative drop in the bucket, considering that about 1.4 million new EVs were registered in the U.S. in 2023 alone and many of those owners could be very happy with their purchases.
But the anti-EV sentiment among some drivers speaks to who is buying EVs now, and what new converts expect from the experience. And fixing those issues will be crucial to wider EV adoption, Kampshoff said.
Those new owners surveyed are, increasingly, moving away from the profile that long-defined the EV life: upper-income or wealthy, probably a single-family homeowner and probably buying a Tesla. Instead, they're buying from other brands at more affordable prices, often enticed by aggressive leasing and financing deals for EVs.
But that also means that they're living without Tesla's robust and reliable fast-charging network (until it's open to all drivers, anyway); may live in apartments without easy access to charging; and are less willing to put up with the kinds of EV-related headaches that many early adopters took in stride. And in recent years, going electric could mean losing a huge amount of your car's resale value thanks to last year's spate of price cuts, which Kampshoff said is another major turn-off for some current owners.
Interestingly, he said, many of those survey respondents in the U.S. who indicated they might reject EVs next time were on the younger side—around 36 years old. And many also have young families. They're the ones who have felt the pain of America's subpar charging network more than others, he said.
""Imagine having little children in the car and having to do a detour for half an hour to find a fast charger, and it's not working,"" Kampshoff said. ""The frustration gets exacerbated.""
McKinsey Study Slide 3
Indeed, that's often an all-too-common situation for EV drivers, whether they have kids or not. Plus, charging at home remains difficult if you rent or live in an apartment complex. And while America's DC fast charging infrastructure has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, it still struggles with both abundance and reliability.
""We're moving more and more into a generation of buyers that rely much on public charging infrastructure,"" Kampshoff said. ""They probably use their car very similar to the way they've used a car before, just by going to public infrastructure. Before, you went to a gas station, and now you've got to use a charger. But now they're realizing, that's not so easy.""
Kampshoff said that this challenge is also an issue of education for buyers who are new to a technology that can be very different from gas-powered cars. Are they being told where and how to charge, or how to get a home charger if that's an option, or what a kilowatt-hour is and what it means for them?
But it's unclear who's going to step up and improve that situation. After all, many—but certainly not all—car dealers have been historically reluctant to sell EVs, since doing so comes with expensive charging investments and potentially losing out on repair revenue. And automakers have long relied on their ""dealer partners"" to teach customers about what these vehicles actually do. Plus, neither of those parties may be in a great rush to sell more EVs as they struggle to make and sell them profitably, he said.

""Not necessarily everybody is equally incentivized to sell them,"" he said. A dealer may say, ""If you are unhappy with the infrastructure or residual values, why don't you switch back to an ICE car for now and then you can go back to your EV later?"" he said. ""Why not push those for a little longer?""
Still, Kampshoff said he was more optimistic about EVs after this study than you may think. ""There's a lot of positive here,"" he said.
He said that since only 29% of global survey respondents indicated they would switch back to an ICE-powered vehicle instead of their EV, ""You can make the statement that 71% said that they won’t switch back. That’s pretty high loyalty to EVs.""
But more needs to be done by all parties involved to keep a new generation of buyers from fleeing electric cars next time.
""The reasons people are unsatisfied are not related to the product,"" he said. ""They’re switching back because of charging and resale values. Both of those are fixable.""

Tesla Is Losing Its Grip On The EV Market. Can Rivals Step Up?,https://insideevs.com/news/726001/tesla-losing-grip-can-rivals-step-up/,Tesla’s declining market share is opening up room for rivals to shine. But it’s still an uphill battle.,7/9/2024 15:30,"Electric vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2024 were a simulacrum of broader industry trends. In many ways, the sales were an extension of what we saw in Q1: Legacy automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Hyundai witnessed double-digit percentage growth compared to last year, whereas Tesla continued to slip.
As Elon Musk’s company pivots to artificial intelligence and robotaxis, its passenger vehicle business seems to have taken a backseat. Sure, Cybertruck production is ramping up and there’s now a refreshed Model 3, which InsideEVs can confirm is excellent. But the rest of the lineup needs upgrades. The facelifted Model Y isn’t due until next year and the Model X and Model S, in their current forms, are way past their expiration dates.
The EV market is complex.
It's certainly way more complex than previously thought. Sales are rising, but not at the levels brands expected. The early adopter phase is long over. To appeal to the new wave of buyers, many of them middle income households, all EV-related anxieties need to vanish. That means hitting the sweet spot with driving range, charging infrastructure and ownership costs.
Can Tesla’s rivals now play a bigger role in the broader adoption of EVs and fill the sales void that’s being left behind?
Analysts certainly think so, but it won’t be easy. According to them, Tesla could continue to lose its EV market share by a few percentage points each year for the rest of this decade. So Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and others have a golden opportunity to step up. But some major roadblocks include high interest rates, a string of EV-ownership-related anxieties, the threat of a new U.S. president reversing pro-EV policies and the challenge of making new affordable models appealing.
How they navigate these obstacles will ultimately decide who comes out on top.
Edmunds’ sales data (excluding direct-to-consumer sales from Tesla, Rivian, etc.) suggests that less than half of current EV owners are repurchasing EVs.
“If you have an EV and you trade it into a dealership, you're still under 50% of the time buying another EV,” said Ivan Drury, the director of insights at Edmunds. About 30% of those customers are going back to gas cars whereas others are opting for hybrids and plug-in hybrids. “Everybody is hurting because of interest rates, range anxiety, charging anxiety, all those anxieties,” Drury said.
EV range has increased over the past few years as battery manufacturers continuously improve the energy density. The charging infrastructure is growing, but probably not at the rate it needs to. Moreover, Tesla’s firing of its Supercharging team was a major blow to the overall charging landscape in the U.S. At the same time, the pool of potential new EV buyers has also increased. That means the limited number of models with over 300 miles of EPA range isn’t enough to drive mass adoption.
“Four or five years ago people were buying EVs as additional cars, not replacement cars,” Drury said. Now buyers are considering EVs as their only cars. But they’re hesitant due to concerns like high costs and inadequate charging infrastructure.
“The dynamics have changed to where now we're talking about mainstream buyers with mainstream concerns,"" he said. ""That is a very different segment of the population than the early adopter.”
Despite the decline in new Tesla sales, the market is headed in the correct direction because there are clear signs of others stepping up.
General Motors increased its EV sales by 40% year-over-year thanks to models like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV. Ford’s EV sales were up 61% thanks to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and many others witnessed record EV sales in the U.S. this quarter.
“The market has taken a drastic turn. You're seeing that the other options are now viable. Tesla has legitimate competition. We're seeing that people are willing to switch brands,” Drury said.
Part of what drives sales are attractive lease deals, cashback offers and many discounts. Several EVs have leases starting under $300 per month, like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, Nissan Ariya, Tesla Model 3, Toyota bZ4x and more. Many of them have 0% APR. “We have about 69% of all EVs from dealerships that are leased, and that makes it very enticing,” Drury said. Customers may be saying, “If you make it cheap enough, I might just roll the dice and do it,"" he said.
“We are forecasting roughly 25,000 fewer Tesla units will be delivered [in 2024] versus 2023,” said Loren McDonald, the CEO of analytics firm EVAdoption.
EVAdoption forecasts U.S. BEV sales to reach 1.21 million units in 2024 versus 1.13 million in 2023, a 7% increase. In the best-case scenario, where sales of models like the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox EV take off and Tesla sales rebound, EVAdoption projects a year-over-year increase of 12-15%.
By the end of the year, GM will offer 10 EVs in its portfolio, the most by any automaker in the U.S. And so far this year, its EVs are already crushing it. All new Ultium-based EVs witnessed double-digit percentage growth in the first two quarters of this year. Even the hulking Hummer EV, starting at a shade under $100,000, is finding buyers.
In addition, automakers are racing to launch the next generation of affordable EVs, many of which are expected to be available in 2026.
Tesla is working on “several affordable models” that Musk said would use a mix of existing platforms and new tech. Ford is developing its new “skunkworks” EVs that include a $25,000 pickup truck, SUV and an EV for rideshare purposes. GM is developing the next-gen Bolt EV. The adorable Kia EV3 is also confirmed for the U.S. and is expected to arrive after 2025.
“These new affordable ones will have to sell themselves on merit. It can't just be cheap because if all I want is cheap, I can get a cheap used EV right now,” Drury said. That’s certainly true because the average transaction price of a used EV has plummeted in recent months.
Even though EV start-ups like Tesla and Rivian rely on direct-to-consumer sales, most of the U.S. car-buying population still relies on dealerships.
People seem to enjoy walking into a showroom, feeling the touch and smell of a new car, exploring the features and speaking to sales staff in person. That means dealerships now have a chance to truly embrace EVs and contribute to the decarbonization that a rapidly warming planet desperately needs.
“People buy the same car over and over again, they go to the same dealerships over and over again—they just want trust,” Drury said.
They love loyal customers because they will sing the praises of the product, the dealership and the brand, according to Drury. Brands like Toyota and Honda have built their entire reputation on loyalty and reliability. “If you're hesitant to go outside of your dealer network, now that's not a problem because the brand you like might actually have an EV,"" he said.
Even if Tesla sales plummet, the conditions are increasingly ripe for others to step up and shine. Legacy automakers already have the reputation and sales framework in place. Millions of existing loyal customers could be open to switching to EVs if their anxieties vanish. To emerge as worthy rivals to Tesla, they need to start offering reliable and cheap models that owners can feel confident about.
Barring something that’s beyond the realm of predictability, like a pandemic or some global downturn, or a disastrous policy change after the presidential elections, it’s pretty clear that EVs are here to stay.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Just Got Way More Affordable,https://insideevs.com/news/725984/ford-mach-e-july-lease/,"Zero percent financing? In this economy? It's real, and Ford is doing it. A new 24-month lease is available on the Mustang Mach-E too.",7/9/2024 12:00,"I don't know if you've noticed this, but it's not cheap to get into a new car these days. Though the average new car price has been going ""down"" over the past few months, it was still around $45,000 in June—and still way up from pre-pandemic times. Plus, sky-high interest rates mean you'll be paying a lot more than you would have a few years ago.
But lately, we've been seeing that one of the cheapest ways to get a new car is to go electric. Many automakers are offering aggressive leasing and financing deals on their EVs amid uneven global demand, in hopes that they can keep last year's momentum going as they build out their long-term electric plans.
Cheap EV Lease deals
We've seen aggressive lease deals on EVs from Chevrolet, Cadillac, Ford, Kia, Hyundai, Lucid, Toyota and more. If you're shopping for a new car, going electric could save you a lot of money right now.
You can add Ford to that list today. The automaker announced that it's adding a new 24-month lease deal to all Mustang Mach-E models, including 2024 and leftover 2023 ones—I'll get to that in a moment—with more lease cash, plus 0% financing if you'd rather go the buying route. That would include the new Mustang Mach-E Rally, which recently got high marks in our testing.
Considering that the average interest rate for a car loan is between 6% and 7% if you have amazing credit, that's quite a compelling deal.
Ford officials also said that 0% financing deals are also available nationwide right now for 72 months and 60 months on 2023 and 2024 F-150 Lightning models, respectively.
But a 24-month lease deal, which includes an additional $7,500 Red Carpet Lease Cash, is especially interesting. Several automakers have extended those two-year lease deals to their EV options; since this technology is evolving so quickly, some customers fear their cars could be ""obsolete"" in a few years and may want to upgrade sooner.
However, now that the Ford EVs can use an adapter to access the Tesla Supercharger network, they've got an edge that competitors don't. Besides getting positive reviews, the Mach-E's sales were up almost 60% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period last year. Ford is now the second best-selling EV manufacturer in the U.S. behind Tesla.
Still, Ford's EV sales have been up and down, and the automaker has since adjusted production to align with customer demand; that does mean some new 2023 models are still for sale nationwide. In this case, if you're willing to go with an ""older"" car, you may be able to score an even better deal. If financed, those Mach-Es can be had with an additional $2,000 off as well.

Features Like Tesla FSD That ‘Promise Too Much’ Are ‘A Bad Thing’: Mercedes-Benz,https://insideevs.com/news/725371/tesla-fsd-promise-too-much-bad-thing-mercedes/,Even small mishaps related to so-called self-driving cars can have a big impact on the whole industry.,7/5/2024 10:00,"Let’s face it, Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving feature is likely the best-known example of an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) that prides itself on offering a hands-free driving experience.
The problem is that Tesla itself states on its website that the feature doesn’t actually turn any car that has it into an autonomous vehicle and requires the driver to be prepared to take over driving at any time. That makes it a Level 2-capable system on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Levels of Driving Automation chart, despite the repeated promises made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that FSD will one day power an entire fleet of robotaxis. That still hasn’t happened yet and it doesn’t sit well with competitors like Mercedes-Benz which already sells a Level 3-capable ADAS feature.
Where's my self-driving car?
Science fiction has been telling kids that they'll buy self-driving and flying cars by the time they become adults for hundreds of years. But ... checks calendar ... that still hasn't happened yet, although there are systems out there that can take over driving in certain situations. Robotaxi startups like Waymo are also advancing the game, but we're still way off the predictions of yesteryear's authors.
“[Rolling out hands-free driving capabilities] should be a step-by-step approach,” said Jochen Haab, Mercedes-Benz’s head of autonomous driving technology for Drive.com.au.” Do it slowly, but do it the right way. Build trust, build confidence,” Haab added.

Hinting at what is arguably the biggest promoter of self-driving tech in the industry, Tesla, which has been involved in several high-profile cases where people have been killed or injured while allegedly driving with the ADAS features enabled, Mercedes-Benz’s rep said such a stance is dangerous for the industry as a whole.
“We're concerned about others, let's say, promising too much,” Haab said. “That's not the way we approach things. The problem is, if things are overpromised or underperform, even if it's very seldom, the entire trust in autonomous driving itself loses confidence. And that's a bad thing.”
Mercedes-Benz was the first automaker in the world to get permission to sell a Level 3-capable system for use on public roads. The Drive Pilot feature can be used in Germany and the American states of California and Nevada, where it supports a maximum speed of 40 miles per hour due to regulatory limitations. BMW also has a Level 3 driving assistant on sale in Germany called Personal Pilot L3.

Referring to Mercedes-Benz’s L3 Drive Pilot, Tesla’s head of vehicle development, Lars Moravy, went on record last year saying that “it’s not really useful” and that Tesla’s system “is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions.”
Currently, Tesla offers two tiers of its ADAS features. Autopilot comes standard on all new EVs sold by the American company and includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer. Next is the $8,000 so-called Full-Self Driving Capability, which includes Navigate on Autopilot, automatic lane changes, automatic parking, summon and smart summon, automatic steering on city streets and traffic and stop sign control.

But The Ariya Was Up 123%,https://insideevs.com/news/725439/nissan-ariya-sales-q2-2024/,"The Ariya isn't a major player in the EV market, but it still outsold the aging Murano.",7/3/2024 13:00,"You may not think about the Nissan Ariya all that much, but maybe you should start. Clearly, buyers are starting to consider it more.
Nissan is still in the middle of an attempted turnaround after struggling for years with an aging lineup of cars and the downstream effects of a huge corporate scandal. So it's not entirely surprising that Nissan's sales were down 3.1% overall in the second quarter of 2024, but one of its brightest spots was the growth of the electric Ariya.
Nissan's uneven EV strategy
Nissan was an early EV pioneer with the Leaf, but it's been accused by critics and even former company insiders of losing that lead. Like the rest of the Japanese auto industry, it's now playing catch-up on the electric front. But the company is pushing hard to launch new hybrid and electric models.
Nissan's U.S. arm announced yesterday that sales of the Ariya were up a whole 123% in Q2 compared to the same period last year. Granted, that only equaled 5,203 Ariyas sold—meaning the model trails behind the Volkswagen ID.4 and achieved less than half as many sales as the Hyundai Ioniq 5—but it is an improvement from last year's numbers.
Interestingly, the Ariya actually outsold the gas-powered Murano crossover, which was down a whopping 49.5% in sales over Q2 of 2023. This is largely speculation on my part, but it's possible that Nissan crossover buyers looked at the Murano and migrated to the Ariya instead on the back of whatever lease deals or discounts they could find. Those haven't been as aggressive as, say, Hyundai or Toyota, but they do exist.
(The Ariya may also be helped along by the fact that the current Murano model is now 10 years old and absolutely looks it inside; it's due to be replaced by an all-new 2025 model soon enough.)
The Ariya may be worth a second look if you're EV-shopping. It features up to 304 miles of range, a variety of trim levels with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, handsome styling and a user experience that's more beginner-friendly than many other electric options. Its max fast-charging speed of 130 kW is hardly the best out there, but considering how many DC fast chargers max out around 150 kW, it may be just fine for now.
Meanwhile, the Nissan Leaf soldiers on in 2024, though it's set to be discontinued soon and suffers from a fast-charging format that's effectively obsolete. It remains perhaps the cheapest new EV on sale right now, but considering the new glut of used options, you have better choices for your money. Despite that, Leaf sales were up slightly in Q2, with 1,925 units sold. That's a rise from 1,880 in the same period last year. But if you want a modern EV from Nissan, the Ariya's the one to get.

Nissan Techs Are Making House Calls to Teach Owners How to Use Their Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/724924/nissan-second-delivery-program/,Does this mean there's too much tech in vehicles?,12/25/2024 7:29,"In case you haven't noticed, modern vehicles are packed with features and technology. Even the Nissan Versa—the cheapest new car in the United States—has a 7-inch touchscreen with voice controls and buttons all over the steering wheel. Step up to something like the Ariya and there's even more to suss out. The basics are usually straightforward, but figuring out all the tech can be intimidating. Nissan wants to change that.
The automaker is launching a new program called Second Delivery. It's essentially a no-cost follow-up visit for people who buy a new Nissan, designed to help them learn just what their car can do. A Nissan ""tech expect"" will coordinate a time and place to meet the owner, generally two weeks after the first delivery. That can be at the owner's home, work, a lunch stop at the local Starbucks, or the dealership where it all began. The expert will take the owner through all the vehicle's systems, step-by-step.
Such things are generally done during the normal delivery process, but the idea here is to give owners some time to acclimate to their new car before diving deeper. Details can also be missed during the big day, as owners are often excited to get on the road with their spanking-new ride. Listening to a salesperson prattle on about automatic headlight functions or adjusting climate settings through your phone may not stick the first time around.
""Now more than ever, customers expect a personalized experience that matches their wants and needs,"" said Dan Mohnke, Nissan VP of eCommerce and customer experience. ""These types of experiences are extremely important for us to offer for our Ariya customers, who are largely new to the Nissan brand and interested in using all of the latest technology.""
For now, Second Delivery is only offered on the Ariya, presumably because it's Nissan's most technologically demanding vehicle. The service ""is expected to expand"" later in 2024 to the Rogue and Leaf.

Study: Nearly Half of EV Owners in America Want to Switch Back to Gas,https://www.motor1.com/news/724788/half-ev-owners-american-switch-gas/,Inadequate charging infrastructure is keeping people from buying EVs.,12/25/2024 7:29,"A few years ago, automakers started to roll out elaborate plans to convert their lineups to battery-electric vehicles. Some even set deadlines for ending gas-powered car production. But many are now reevaluating the future. Sales are slowing for some and not others, consumer interest is waning, and now nearly half of EV owners in America might switch back to gas. What is going on?
McKinsey & Co.'s 2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse study reveals that 46 percent of EV owners in the United States, well above the worldwide average of 29 percent, want to switch to gasoline cars because of the inadequate charging infrastructure. Thirty-five percent of global respondents said the public network isn't good enough yet. Thirty-four percent said EV ownership costs remain too high, while 32 percent said EVs impacted their driving patterns too much on long trips.
The US charging network is growing, which could eliminate these hurdles for owners. As of May, the US had 183,000 public EV chargers, but there still aren't enough. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 allocated $5 billion in grants toward building fast chargers, but the rollout is taking forever due to a myriad of local, state, and federal regulations and consumer needs.
Other reasons owners gave as to why they might switch back include the inability to charge at home (24 percent), the stress of worrying about charging (21 percent), and charging mobility requirements (16 percent). Only 13 percent said they did not enjoy the driving experience. Some people just enjoy driving a combustion car, like 18 percent of US respondents and 28 percent in Germany.
The study also reveals why automakers seem so disjointed from one another in their EV efforts. Growth and the desire to switch back aren't equal worldwide, and some markets are converting faster than others, putting automakers in a difficult position of attempting to cater to wildly varying needs across the globe.
Shockingly, Americans aren't the most eager to switch back to gas. In Australia, a country known for its vast interior, 49 percent of EV owners are considering returning to the pump. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Japan, where only 13 percent of owners might return to a combustion-powered vehicle. Other countries below the worldwide average include Italy (15 percent), France (18 percent), Germany (24 percent), and China (28 percent). Brazil joins the US and Australia above the average at 38 percent.

"Ford CEO Hits Back At Electric Vehicle 'Politics,' Disinformation",https://insideevs.com/news/724961/ford-ceo-farley-ev-note/,"Ford CEO Jim Farley, a ""lifelong petrolhead,"" has a lot to say about EV skepticism—and ceding American leadership to China or Europe.",6/28/2024 18:33,"If you're an auto industry executive in 2024, there are three ways to do your job: actively fight against any sort of global electrified transition, bury your head in the sand and aim to retire fast enough for it to be someone else's problem, or actively face these challenges head-on. I give credit to Ford CEO Jim Farley for taking the third path.
Ford hasn't always gotten the EV transformation right under Farley's watch. It's had many of the same stumbles as any other established automaker or even startup out there. Software presents endless headaches, production costs are high, the dealer networks often don't want to play ball, and economic and political trends mean that widespread EV adoption will likely take longer than anyone anticipated.
EVs get political
The Biden Administration initially set aggressive targets for the U.S. new car market to go 50% by 2030. But that's proving more difficult than expected. The backlash to EV investments exists sharply along partisan lines, and if President Trump is reelected in November, many fear that America will cede technological leadership to China.
Still, Ford under Farley—who took the top job at the automaker in 2020—has been repeatedly willing to think outside the box when it comes to EVs. He got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to open up the North American Charging Standard plug to the rest of the industry, hired tech-savvy executives who know what they're doing, established a ""skunkworks"" team to build an affordable EV platform that can take on competitors from China and built out Ford's EV operation as a separate business line.
That's a lot. Especially for a 121-year-old company that is, by the accounts of many inside it who I've spoken to, a tough ship to turn around. But Farley does seem to get where this is all going, and he recognizes that Ford and other so-called ""legacy"" automakers will be made irrelevant and extinct if they don't adapt.
Ford CEO Jim Farley
And Farley seems to get that Ford is a different animal than Tesla or Lucid or Rivian, with a much larger and more traditional customer base to convince to go electric over time. I think that's one reason he penned this article on LinkedIn today touting the benefits of EVs. The article, ""Confessions From a Lifelong Petrol Head—I Love Electric Vehicles And It Has Nothing To Do With Politics,"" is worth a read in full.
""As a lifelong petrolhead, I was [as] surprised as anyone when I fell in love with electric vehicles,"" Farley wrote. ""It wasn’t government policies or political beliefs that sparked this late-career romance with electric vehicles. It’s because I drive one: my Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum... Every morning, mine is topped up with 300 miles of range. No gas stations, ever.""
The article was published ahead of Farley's appearance Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. In it, the CEO hits back at many of the criticisms levied at Ford as of late: that EVs are an enormous cash drain, they're inferior replacements for gas-powered vehicles and that people are being ""forced"" into them by the government.
""As the CEO of a major automaker, I feel compelled to tell customers the truth about electric vehicles amid all the disinformation and misunderstandings,"" Farley wrote. ""It’s true that we are losing money on electric vehicles in the first innings of this transition, largely due to the upfront investment costs. But that too is changing. After all, what major technological leap forward wasn’t challenging and costly at the early stages?""
Farley added, ""The tipping point we’re working toward will come not from regulators who push us or from politicians who try to hold us back. It will come from consumers.""
That last part, and the timing of this note, are key here. The note makes no mention of any specific politicians, but it was released the morning after the CNN Presidential Debate between President Joe Biden and his rival, former President Donald Trump. My guess is Ford anticipated EVs would become a point of contention between the two candidates, as has happened many times before—specifically the Biden Administration's investments into charging infrastructure and advocacy of EV tax credits. (EVs actually didn't come up much during the debate; let's just say things went in a much weirder direction.)
But as Farley notes here, EVs have become highly political in America, despite merely being another form of technology. If Trump is reelected in November, there's a strong chance that the EV tax credit program could disappear, and that Biden's tougher new fuel economy rules could be rolled back. That may slow the industry's electric push. But as Farley implies here, it could merely mean that America will end up even further behind on the mobility technology of tomorrow than it already is now. After all, the nascent Chinese auto industry received some $230 billion in national subsidies over 15 years, and now Western and other Asian automakers are scrambling to catch up.
""We are in a global race to compete in a future where electric propulsion will undoubtedly be a giant force in transportation,"" Farley wrote. ""America cannot cede innovation leadership to China, Europe, or any other region. Ford has survived and thrived for 121 years because we have never been shy about seizing the moment to innovate and face the future. Now, we are investing billions in plants, tech centers, and our workforce to create the must-have cars, SUVs, and trucks of tomorrow.""
Farley closes his note by saying that Ford is committed to offering a range of powertrain choices for customers, including hybrids and internal combustion vehicles. But as a consummate car guy—he races Mustangs in whatever free time he has—he encourages people to give EVs a try too.
""You are better off trying one for yourself and making your own decision,"" he wrote. ""What’s more American than that? Who knows, you might just surprise yourself.""

Mercedes Is Spending Big Money On Gas Engines Again,https://www.motor1.com/news/724830/mercedes-spending-big-money-gas-engines/,"""A lot more"" is being invested in the S-Class compared to a usual facelift.",12/25/2024 7:29,"After conceding that its electrification goals have been overly ambitious, Mercedes is now pouring an obscene amount of money into combustion engines. In an interview with German publication Wirtschaftswoche, CEO Ola Källenius said ICE technology ""will last well into the 2030s."" To make sure gas engines will meet increasingly stringent regulations, massive investments are necessary.
Just this year, the three-pointed star is spending €14 billion (about $15 billion at current exchange rates) on its passenger car division alone. The funds are reserved for ""high-tech combustion technology” but also electrification and digitalization. Although the Swedish-German business executive didn’t specify how much Mercedes is spending on ICE, he admitted it's ""more money than previously planned.""
Källenius brought up the S-Class and the flagship's mid-cycle update scheduled for 2026: ""We have invested a lot more in the model update of the new combustion engine S-Class than we normally spend on a facelift."" The goal for Mercedes is to have its conventional powertrains at ""the very highest technological level."" Without spending big money on gasoline and diesel engines, the luxury brand ""would suddenly stall our combustion engine business in 2027 or 2028.""
He was referring to Euro 7 and China 7 regulations and how the engines must be updated to run cleaner to meet stricter emissions rules. The goal is for Mercedes to tweak all ""relevant combustion engines and transmission combinations"" to avoid having to pay massive fines. Källenius mentioned future engines will be electrified to some extent, so expect even more hybrids in the lineup.
Mercedes knows it must adapt now that the transition to EVs isn’t going as planned. Three years ago, it said plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars would represent about 50 percent of annual sales by 2025. However, that’s highly unlikely to happen. At one point, the company even said it would go fully electric by 2030 in some countries “where market conditions allow.”
After being hit in the face by reality, Mercedes has no other way but to readjust its goals. It now wants hybrids and electric cars to account for half of deliveries by the end of the decade. The ultimate objective to become carbon neutral by 2040 hasn't changed, according to Källenius.
He refuted rumors about the company canceling the development of a platform for the next-generation EQS: ""The project is running at high speed."" In addition, it's not scrapping plans for the promised eight gigafactories to build batteries to support its electric ambitions. However, the facilities will be ready ""a little later"" than originally planned.
Since we mentioned the EQS, there was an interesting report earlier this year about how Mercedes was testing its stately electric car with a range-extending combustion engine. The big EV was allegedly fitted with a tiny two-cylinder, 1.0-liter turbocharged engine mounted at the front. However, trials were supposedly stopped.
Mercedes does have a deal with Geely to jointly work on hybrid engines that will go into Volvo models as well. The Chinese automotive giant has expertise in range-extenders, including a separate deal with Renault. The newly formed Horse division specializes in combustion engines, including those developed as range extenders.

How Volkswagen's Endless Software Headaches Led It To Rivian,https://insideevs.com/news/724619/rivian-volkswagen-explained-cm/,"Plus, GM's Cruise gets a new CEO, and we look at the EV market's ""ebbs and flows"" as every company struggles to figure out the future.",6/26/2024 9:49,"""CARIAD"" has six letters, but in the auto industry, it's become kind of a four-letter word.
The Volkswagen Group's in-house software division has dealt with countless delays, layoffs, reorganizations and other setbacks since its founding in 2020. Its very name has become a kind of shorthand for the entire industry's difficulties with, well, making anything that doesn't revolve around an engine and a transmission. We can't say CARIAD is throwing in the towel, but its challenges do explain why it's calling in backup from nascent EV startup Rivian.
On this midweek edition of our Critical Materials morning news roundup, we're looking back at how VW ended up needing help from Rivian, and what Rivian gets in return. Plus, General Motors' equally troubled robotaxi division Cruise gets a new CEO, and why you should get ready for the Era of Uncertainty.
Rivian Zonal Architecture
I think that yesterday's announcement of a software joint venture between Volkswagen and Rivian—which also includes the former investing up to $5 billion into the latter—requires a bit of a history lesson. And it may go back as far as Dieselgate, when the Volkswagen Group faced an earth-shattering scandal that led it to commit to one day going all-electric.
To do that, the VW Group needed, for lack of a better term, a Tesla-like approach to software and digital technology. Historically for the entire auto industry, ""software"" means things like engine management, or driver-facing bits like infotainment and navigation, or numerous components made by different suppliers with different software standards who often didn't talk to one another. It was piecemeal and old-school, compared to the smartphones and tablets that have become an integral part of our lives over the past two decades.
That doesn't work in a world where cars will be defined by over-the-air software updates and downloadable, paid features that can mean new revenue sources. Or EV battery management. Or DC fast charger integration. Or advanced automated driving assistance and, one day, fully autonomous cars.
You get the idea. It's a different world now. The cars of the future will be more like computers on wheels than anything else, so now Volkswagen and the rest need to get great at making computers. The alternative is they get turned into car body manufacturers for tech companies, or worse, outright slaughtered by new players who are better at this; China's industry in particular is way ahead on this front.
To be fair, pretty much every ""legacy"" automaker has struggled with pivoting their 100-year-old businesses to do this stuff well. (And companies like Fisker show the startups aren't automatically better, either.) But VW's CARIAD division has had some particularly high-profile setbacks. I wrote about this in-depth for The Verge at the end of 2022, and it feels like things are only incrementally better since I did.
Issues with software have led to negative reviews of early examples of cars like the Volkswagen ID.4; delays of crucial VW Group products, such as the new Porsche Macan EV and Audi Q6 E-Tron; entire platforms, like the one that was supposed to underpin the flagship ""Project Trinity""; and leaning on outside partners like Mobileye for automated driving rather than doing everything in-house. Besides CARIAD's layoffs and reorganizations, these software messes are also part of why VW CEO Herbert Diess was shown the door in 2022.
So, yes. It's been bad. And as the Volkswagen Group loses ground in China and struggles to grow in North America—where its core brand has long struggled to be relevant—it cannot afford to be so bad at the future.
Enter Rivian, which is doing very cool things but needs cash to get past the enormously costly ""startup"" phase of its business, much like Tesla before it got the Model 3 and Model Y out in force. The investment from VW will help Rivian stay in the game. But it also establishes Rivian as a software powerhouse—something it hadn't really been known for until recently. Cool-looking electric SUVs, sure. But now the world is starting to view Rivian as a leader in tech as well.
Here's TechCrunch to explain just what VW is buying:
Rivian’s new electrical architecture and compute platform reduced the number of electronic control units (ECUs) used to control the vehicle from 17 different ECUs in its first generation to seven. This new zonal architecture allows Rivian to cut more than 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle—a 44-pound weight savings—and to build its vehicles faster.
That new electrical architecture—or what Scaringe describes as new vehicle topography—is seen internally as a key innovation at Rivian and one that allows the company to wirelessly update software. The new zonal architecture supports Rivian’s software stack, which was also developed and deployed in-house. That software stack includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.
So it's not just ""software"" here. It's a rethinking of how cars are designed and built entirely, something the VW Group has repeatedly tried and failed to do.
I think it's important to note that a Rivian partnership won't reverse VW's misfortunes overnight. Indeed, this partnership is going to take years to bear fruit. Likely, VW will find some way to buy time with more conventional products—hence the debuts of the updated Jetta and Golf R this week—and whatever EV rollouts it was already confident about until the electric race really heats up toward the end of this decade.
Rivian has a better shot at staying alive until then, too, which is great news for everyone who wants to pre-order an R3X. But it doesn't say much about ""legacy"" auto's ability to face the future on its own. VW's stock price slipped while Rivian's shot up 30% after the announcement.
Porsche Taycan Cutaway
I'd say the first part of the 2020s reflected a belief that the auto industry could just pivot to batteries and software fairly easily, because Tesla pulled it off, so how hard can it be when the real companies gave it a shot? But 2024 is where everyone is getting a badly needed reality check. See above for one of the highest-profile examples out there.
Over at the Detroit Free Press (subscription required), writer Mark Phelan lays out just how hard this transition has been, but also throws water on the idea that uneven EV adoption this year means electric power is ""done"":
So what's up with all the reports about automakers delaying plans for when, where and how many electric vehicles they’ll produce and sell?
They’re true, but they’re only part of the story.
General Motors and Ford have repeatedly said they are delaying the production of EVs, batteries and motors. GM just trimmed its 2024 EV sales forecast by 50,000 vehicles. Fiat Chrysler (now part of Stellantis), a slow starter, has yet to sell any.
Those developments and more fueled claims that EVs are a sham, toys for the wealthy and woke, unfit for use by the rest of us.
Are EVs doomed? Have automakers wasted precious time and resources rushing them into cul-de-sacs? Not a chance.
Remaking a 140-year-old industry is hard. In addition to the goofs and glitches that come with any new technology, virtually every major global automaker has either gotten out over its skis or has been lambasted for a slow and half-hearted strategy.
Phelan says something I really like: that automakers ""won the press conference,"" meaning they made big, bold announcements that seemed amazing, but were edicts their engineers and the infrastructure couldn't deliver on. Expect a lot more ""adapting to changing realities,"" as he puts it; more ups and downs, more canceled and delayed products, more pivots and more of an overall mess than anyone could've predicted.
GM Cruise Integrated AV System
And here's yet another example of transition headaches. GM's Cruise, which hit pause on operations last year amid high-profile crashes and only resumed service this month, named a new CEO yesterday: former Amazon and Microsoft executive Marc Whitten.
He seems legit, and Cruise needs the help getting back on track, CNBC reports:
Whitten was a founding engineer at Microsoft's Xbox before leaving the company after more than 17 years to become chief product officer of audio company Sonos in 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then worked at Amazon as vice president of entertainment devices and services before his most recent role as chief product and technology officer for software development company Unity's Create.
His appointment comes at a crucial time for Cruise, which is testing and relaunching its autonomous vehicles on public roadways. It ceased operations weeks after an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi. A third-party probe into the October incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that led to the accident. The probe also investigated allegations of a cover-up by Cruise leadership, but investigators did not find evidence to support those claims.
Getting to the future is a real pain in the ass, isn't it?
2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Technical Cutaway
Like I said, every automaker has had troubles with this stuff. So who in your mind is doing it best? When it comes to EVs, I'd say Hyundai Motor Group, but it still lags behind on things like over-the-air updates. Plus, I don't think their ADAS technology is anything to write home about, at least as far as the passenger cars are concerned. And Mercedes has a strong software game, but a weirdly waning interest in EVs.
So which established player are you betting on? Or is the answer ""none of the above""?

Plug-In Hybrids Overtake EV Growth. But There Are Some Catches,https://insideevs.com/news/724181/phev-growth-overtakes-bevs-report/,A new report suggests that testing cycles and electric-only range need to improve vastly to draw climate benefits from PHEVs.,6/24/2024 10:30,"Plug-in hybrids are in a unique position right now. While the sales of battery electric vehicles have been steadily increasing over the past few years with policy and infrastructure support designed to favor them, consumers have recently shown that they’re interested in PHEVs, too.
For starters, PHEVs are a bridge between gas cars and BEVs. They have both, a gas engine and one or more electric motors powered by a small lithium-ion battery. The combination allows drivers to cover short distances, typically between 20-50 miles in EV mode only. When the battery depletes, you can either plug it back in or rely on the combustion engine, leaving not much scope for range anxiety.
PHEV growth outpaces EVs.
To be clear, BEV sales overall still vastly outnumber PHEV sales, but the latter has been gaining some traction in recent years. In part, that's because consumers are concerned about the high costs of owning a BEV and the lack of abundant and reliable charging and range anxiety.
This has led some to believe that PHEVs, and not fully electric cars, represent a more plausible electrified future—at least in the near term. However, research from BloombergNEF's 2024 Electric Vehicle Outlook has some caveats about the rise of such hybrids. It explains how adoption rates are skewed due to high sales mostly outside the U.S., where high-quality options have lured buyers en masse. And it also says that for automakers, increasing their all-electric range is a critical challenge seen as key to wider adoption.
2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
So are PHEVs back in vogue? Well, the answer is yes, but there's a twist. They have become popular mainly in Europe and China, which together represented 90% of PHEV sales last year. In the U.S., they're not exactly hot sellers.
In Europe, customers have several great PHEV options. The Volvo XC60, Ford Kuga, BMW X1, Porsche Cayenne and Peugeot 3008 were some of the best-selling models in the continent according to JATO Dynamics data (via Statista).
China is a different beast altogether. The country became the largest PHEV market in 2022 thanks to an influx of affordable models from BYD primarily. But many other brands like Li Auto and Geely are also fighting it out for a bigger share of the market.
BYD Song Plus DM-i
According to car research firm Autovista24, five of the ten best-selling EVs in China in April 2024 also came in PHEV variants. The best-seller is the BYD Song, offered in both BEV and PHEV variants. BYD sold some 54,300 units of the Song in April 2024 alone. Its 18.3-kilowatt-hour battery allows 50 miles of zero-emissions range whereas the combined range is 671 miles.
Chinese customers are spoiled for choice with hot-selling options like the Aito A9, Denza D9 and BYD Qin Plug. This pushed plug-in hybrids to 30% of new passenger EV sales worldwide last year, slightly up from 2022 levels. In the US, they only hit 19% of all new EV sales in 2023. But that is also a record.
Stellantis sells more PHEVs than any other automaker. Its sales increased by 124% last year, thanks to models like the Dodge Hornet, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Alfa Romeo Tonale, Jeep Wrangler 4xe and the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe.
Toyota relies on plug-in hybrids, but not that much. Although, its PHEV sales growth in the U.S. has outpaced BEV sales. In Q1 2024, Toyota’s PHEV sales were up 94%, whereas BEV sales were up 84% (Including Lexus models).
BNEF found that automakers are increasing the electric range of their PHEVs to meet consumer needs. Globally, the average range of PHEVs rose from 33 miles in 2017 to nearly 50 miles in 2023.
The higher ranges are a result of larger and more energy-dense batteries. The average PHEV battery pack size reached around 15 kWh in the U.S. and Europe in 2023, compared to 26 kWh in China. And among them, the ones offered in the U.S. have the lowest electric range.
Since 2021, the average PHEV range in the U.S. has remained stable, at around 29.8 miles (48 km.) In Europe, it has declined from around 43 miles (70 km) to approximately 38 miles (61 km.)
In China though, plug-in hybrids have surpassed 57 miles (92 km) of all-electric range on average, nearly double what is available in the U.S.

""So when automakers say they want to bring PHEVs to the US, are they really bringing high-quality PHEVs with a longer all-electric range?"" Corey Cantor, a senior EV analyst at BNEF, told InsideEVs.
Providing a longer all-electric range, like what's available in China, could push drivers to use their PHEVs in electric mode more frequently, Cantor said. That's key because the environmental benefits of PHEVs can disappear if they're just used like gas vehicles.
""It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk or a sure thing,"" he said. ""But you have a better chance of getting consumers to charge up for longer periods than if you're adding 22 miles and have to be charging it constantly.""
What also expanded China's lead was range-extender EVs (EREVs). EREVs primarily run on electric power but have an auxiliary internal combustion engine or generator that recharges the battery when it gets low. This design extends the driving range beyond what the battery alone can provide, reducing range anxiety.
Nearly 30% of China’s PHEV sales were extended-range models in 2023, which have an average range of 79 miles (127 km).
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that the real-world benefits of PHEVs and those shown in government testing are vastly different. Their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, on average, are approximately two to four times higher than what’s seen in testing cycles.
The rated range is high because fuel-economy standards often make assumptions around emissions and electric range use. BNEF says this has to change. “Drawing from real-world data as PHEV penetration grows can help deliver more realistic policy design and tangible climate benefits,” the report states.

If you don’t charge a PHEV regularly, you’re just carrying the dead weight of the lithium-ion battery around. That leads to using more engine power and hence more fuel. This is also one of the reasons their cost of ownership is higher than ICE cars and BEVs.
BNEF said even the most efficient PHEVs are more expensive to own than average gas cars and BEVs. Assuming a 50% electric usage rate, BNEF found that the Toyota RAV4 Prime was still more expensive to own than a Tesla Model Y or a gas-powered or hybrid RAV4.
""From an automaker perspective, you want to get that electric mode utilization as high as you can,"" Cantor said. That unlocks the benefits of using less battery materials, qualifying for Inflation Reduction Act credits or having to build fewer EV chargers, he said.
""But if the utilization is still too low, then you're just going to be potentially harming the climate,"" he added.

GM EV Owners Still Can't Use Tesla Superchargers. Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/723885/gm-ev-supercharger-access/,"GM said Supercharger access would be online in ""Spring 2024."" Now we know more about what's going on.",6/19/2024 17:31,"With General Motors about halfway through what was meant to be a do-over year on the electric vehicle front, one major intended perk for its EV owners has yet to materialize: access to the Tesla Supercharger network. GM indicated that owners would be able to use America's best fast-charging network sometime in spring 2024.
But summer starts tomorrow, and a high-level industry source with knowledge of the Supercharger rollout tells us that GM won't hit that target. However, the company is in the ""final steps"" of the integration, so access should be coming soon. Here's what happened.
Supercharger Rollout Woes
Tesla has finally started opening up its Supercharger Network of fast chargers to other automakers. But right as the transition was picking up steam, Elon Musk fired almost all of the Supercharger team. That's cast doubt on the initial timelines, and automakers like Polestar have already announced that they won't hit their original target rollout date. GM targeted either ""spring 2024"" or ""the first half of 2024,"" depending on who you ask. But spring ends tomorrow
The first thing to know is that the deadline wasn't entirely set by GM. It was actually Tesla that put ""Spring 2024"" on its website as the target date for Ford, Rivian, Polestar, Volvo and GM vehicles. But apparently, automakers themselves didn't know that was the timing until Tesla posted it publicly.
Tesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North America
Even still, the company looked to be on track to deliver by the end of spring, something a GM spokesperson reaffirmed to InsideEVs on May 30. According to the source—who spoke to InsideEVs anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the process—that characterization was still accurate at the time.
""There were certain agreement-level details that needed to be finalized [and] couldn't be"" in time, they noted as one of the many last-minute hurdles. The ""last mile"" of getting access rolled out took longer than anyone expected.
One potential (but obvious) wrench in the plan may have been Tesla firing its entire Supercharger team in April, then scrambling to re-hire some of them after the ramifications of that decision became apparent. Still, it's not immediately clear why the process has taken longer than expected. Our source declined to comment on those discussions.
Tesla's Supercharger Fiasco
The software part of the plan, however, is done. The next batch of companies has had extra time to work on integration compared to rivals like Ford and Rivian, and our source doesn't think GM EV owners will face the same validation, handshake and payment problems that some Ford and Rivian owners have had while using Superchargers.
The source added that GM has the adapters in stock and ready to send out, and that Tesla has uploaded all of the different automakers onto its app.
Very soon, our source indicated—in the coming weeks, although they declined to give a specific timeline. ""There are a lot of variables to work through,"" they said.
Tesla does not respond to requests for comment from the media. GM, however, sent InsideEVs the following statement:
""We are working as quickly as possible to open up access to the Supercharger Network for our customers and delivering a seamless charging experience is our priority. GM continues to expand charging infrastructure throughout North America, with GM drivers currently having access to more than 195,000 chargers. We believe that access to charging is the best way serve our customers and grow the EV market.""
That work should pay off soon. When Supercharger access rolls out to GM EVs, we'll keep updating you on how to get adapters, how the charging process works and how our initial testing goes.
It sounds like GM has had time to get this right, so for the sake of a lot of new Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq and Equinox EV owners, here's hoping it's the smoothest rollout so far.

"A Kia EV3 Built In Mexico Could Be A Sub-$30,000 Electric Car",https://insideevs.com/news/723855/kia-ev3-mexico-production/,"Kia won't say where the EV3 will be built. But Mexico is a possibility, which would unlock tax credits to make it even more affordable.",6/19/2024 15:00,"Like the rest of the Hyundai Motor Group, Kia has been on a roll lately. While other automakers are easing off the accelerator on electric vehicles amid a weird year full of uneven demand, Kia is just straight-up going for it with new models like the EV9 three-row SUV. But nothing is as hotly anticipated as the Kia EV3, which should be one of the stronger contenders in the new race for smaller and cheaper EVs. And there's also reason to believe the U.S.-market Kia EV3 end up even cheaper than its targeted $35,000 price tag.
Buried at the bottom of a recent article in Korea's Business Post is a line speculating that Kia could begin EV3 production at its Monterrey, Mexico plant ""in the second half of next year."" A few publications have run with that news like it's confirmed, but no plans have been officially announced for the EV3.
The affordable EV race
Most experts now believe the next growth wave for EVs will be in the smaller, more affordable categories. Buyers are done with just being offered large, expensive luxury EVs and want cheaper options. With a targeted starting price around $35,000, the upcoming Kia EV3 could be a strong contender when that race kicks off.
It's important to note that this plan is entirely plausible, and if it happens—and I would say there's a strong chance it might—then it would allow the EV3 to qualify for tax credits when sold in the U.S. That could put its starting price tag in the sub-$30,000 range, if not less.
Here's why it's a viable plan: Kia elaborated last fall on its plans to build a global EV manufacturing apparatus with factories all over. Those include EV production facilities in Korea, China, the U.S., Eastern Europe and, yes, Mexico. Some of those factories would make the same models; others would build EVs specific to those regions and their unique needs.
Kia's factory near Monterrey has been open since 2016 and it already makes cars like the Forte and Rio, so it knows what it's doing on the affordable compact front. But being in North America should allow the EV3 to qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits when purchased, as some Mexican-made EVs do already, like the new Chevrolet Equinox EV. Moreover, the timing of that report makes sense as well; the EV3 goes on sale in Korea next month, followed by Europe toward the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2025. That's not an unrealistic timeline to set the Monterrey plant up to make the car.
Tax credits have been something of a sticking point for Kia and its corporate cousin Hyundai so far. Executives at the Korean automakers have said they were initially promised tax credits by the Biden Administration since South Korea is such an important U.S. ally. That later ended up not being the case as the tax credit system only incentivized EVs and batteries made in North America.
Instead, Kia and Hyundai have seen big sales wins through leasing, which does allow for an EV to qualify for the tax credit, no matter where it's made. Still, leasing isn't for everyone, and if automakers are serious about widespread EV adoption, then the incentives have to figure into purchases too.
The EV3 is projected to have up to 300 miles of range and will come in front- and all-wheel-drive forms. It will be available with two battery pack sizes: 58.3 kWh and 81.4 kWh, although for cost reasons it loses its bigger brothers' faster-charging 800V architecture. Still, it's not going to be too bad on that front, as Kia estimates a 10% to 80% charging time of 31 minutes.
Kia has every reason to try and pull off Mexican production for the EV3, but we won't know until we know. A Kia spokesperson declined to comment on the reports to InsideEVs, saying the automaker had nothing to announce yet on this front. With any luck, future announcements will bring good news for people who want more affordable electric cars.

The Fisker Bankruptcy Doesn't Mean EVs Are in Trouble. Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/723752/fisker-bankruptcy-ev-sales/,Fisker likely would've faced this same outcome if it had a gas engine under its hood instead of a battery in the floor.,6/18/2024 17:31,"Fisker Inc. is the latest electric vehicle startup to fail to cross the ""valley of death."" Last night, after months of struggles, the automaker announced that it would enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware District Court, starting the process of selling its assets and restructuring its debt.
What that means for the thousands of owners of its sole car, the electric Fisker Ocean SUV, is now extremely unclear. But it does mean that its namesake, CEO and design legend Henrik Fisker, has now overseen two failed automotive startups.
Fisker's Bankruptcy
After months of corporate cutbacks, rumors about bankruptcy advisors and slashed staffing, Fisker finally declared bankruptcy Tuesday. That leaves owners of its Ocean electric SUV in a bind, forced to choose between holding out hope for maintenance and support that may never come or selling their cars for a massive loss.
It would be easy to look at Fisker's troubles as symptomatic of the broader problems with the electric vehicle market in 2024, a time when sales are rapidly growing but not nearly at the pace that the industry expected. Many EV startups and established automakers are struggling with production issues, software bugs, defects and other challenges—not to mention the enormous financial costs of launching such radically different vehicles.
Fisker even alluded to this in its bankruptcy announcement: ""Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently,"" Fisker officials said.
Fisker Ocean Factory
But the fact is that Fisker likely would've faced this same outcome if the Ocean had a gas-powered engine under its hood and not a lithium-ion battery built into its floor. The automaker had unique problems from the get-go, from launching a product that many said was fundamentally incomplete to lacking a proper infrastructure for sales, parts and repairs.
""I don't think [the EV slowdown and Fisker's bankruptcy] are really related,"" Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF, told me in an email. He added that Fisker sold about 2,000 Oceans in the first quarter of 2024—a drop in the bucket compared to the 3.175 million EVs sold globally in the same period.
""In general, it could lead to more negative vibes towards EV startups and anxiety around the future of the market,"" Cantor said. ""But to me, this isn't an EV story, it's a Fisker story.""
If an EV slowdown is really underway, that isn't what killed Fisker; Fisker did that on its own.
Fisker Inc. was formed in 2016 and started production of the Ocean in 2022. It's often compared to two other EV startups that launched with similar timelines: Rivian and Lucid. But while Rivian found a niche with luxurious, off-road-capable electric SUVs and pickup trucks—it was actually first to market with the latter—and Lucid has delivered the most efficient and highest-range EVs on the market, Fisker's positioning always felt a little murkier.
The Ocean is an electric crossover. Rather than carving out its own unique space, that put it in contention with just about every other automaker out there. Nearly all of them sell electric crossovers. Going after the most popular segment in cars makes sense. But what did the Ocean bring to the table that was truly special or worthy of hype?
Sure, the Ocean is stylish and delivers an impressive 360-mile maximum range figure. But many EV crossovers look cool and deliver good range now. What did the Ocean do that the Ioniq 5 couldn't? Or a BMW iX? Or a Cadillac Lyriq? Or even the Tesla Model Y, which may be everywhere, but is for a reason? Plenty of early adopter types are into what's new and different, but the Ocean always seemed to lack a ""gotta have it"" factor that made other EVs stand out.
It's not as if Fisker didn't have other ideas. The automaker had several other planned designs, like the $29,000 Pear, the four-door convertible Ronin and, later on, the compact Alaska pickup truck.
Fisker Alaska
The future of any of those models is now in doubt. The Pear, Ronin and Alaska seemingly never made it past the concept stage. Even if Fisker's assets get bought by some new entity, those models are likely too premature to see the light of day.
That leaves us with the Ocean—just another electric crossover, except one that may end up orphaned by the company that made it.
When I interviewed Henrik Fisker for The Verge in late 2022, he boasted of the Ocean's record development time, which was about half that of most other cars. But according to multiple reports—including accounts from current and former employees who spoke to InsideEVs—that plan hinged on software updates and fixes to be deployed later on. And it turns out that was a very tall order.
Most reviews of the Ocean are rife with words like ""incomplete"" and ""unfinished."" Consumer Reports was especially scathing earlier this year, citing issues with the accelerator, ride quality, Bluetooth connectivity, the total lack of adaptive cruise control at the outset and more.
2023 Fisker Ocean
Veteran car reviewer Keith Barry said he had minimal confidence in the product after ""our experiences with buggy software, features that disappear and reappear, and promises that future updates will activate options we already paid for.""
Moreover, an utterly scathing test of the Ocean by YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee may have been due to the car's outdated software, but it's hard to believe an update would've fixed all of its problems. Even the owners who told InsideEVs they loved the cars also said they were getting sick of all the bugs.
""Other EV startups and legacy automakers would be wise to avoid Fisker's mistakes: ensure that key products are included in the vehicle from day one and not rely on the potential for software updates to rush products to market,"" Cantor said. ""Too often it felt as if Fisker let its desire to meet internal deadlines rush ahead of those responsibilities to its potential consumers.""
While just about every automaker is undertaking a big push for over-the-air software updates, including so they can offer new features worth paying for, Fisker's experience is proof that band-aids after the fact are no replacement for rigorous development.
Reports of the turmoil inside Fisker itself have spread like wildfire. Current and former employees have relayed stories of Henrik Fisker and his wife, COO and CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker, allegedly mismanaging the company while being obsessed with protecting their reputations. Those Fisker employees say the company's leaders aggressively micromanaged relationships with suppliers and cut costs at every turn, sometimes putting it odds with Magna International, the contract firm hired to build the Ocean.
What's worse, the company never quite figured out the basics of carmaking, including a functioning sales channel, an infrastructure to supply parts to owners and a means to repair vehicles. The sales process was often in utter disarray, Business Insider reported today. InsideEVs' own reporting indicates that Fisker employees sometimes had poach components from its factory and disassemble entire cars to get needed parts to customers.
While the company attempted to pivot from a direct sales model like Tesla uses to a dealership-centric one, that never materialized in time to save it.

""Establishing a new automaker takes a considerable amount of marketing, not to mention the proper distribution and retail networks that need to be built,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""Even if the company does not have a set dealership network, an organized method of delivery, maintenance and repair for these vehicles must be created because even modern vehicles need more than just over-the-air updates for the software.""
Had Fisker come to market with a stronger emphasis on the basics of carmaking, from testing to sales and customer service and beyond, it may have had more of a shot at the same long-term viability that other startups are aiming for.
In the end, it's important to remember that Fisker declared bankruptcy around the same period that General Motors, the Hyundai Motor Group, Ford and others saw huge sales gains, and competitors like Lucid and Rivian have new or updated products out or coming soon.
Plus, they're all worried about the rise of China's auto industry, which is singularly focused on electric vehicles. In hindsight, if Fisker was unable to even get parts in the hands of customers who needed them, it's hard to imagine it could've been a viable competitor to the likes of BYD and Geely.
""Making cars is really hard,"" Cantor said. ""And making electric vehicles is hard too. Fisker's bankruptcy isn't a part of the story linked closely to the overall trials and tribulations of the EV market, but closer to the classic difficulty with startup companies succeeding.""
Still, Fiorani said he wouldn't rule out new startup players coming in, even as so-called ""legacy"" automakers go big on EVs and software features too. But they can no longer afford to make the mistakes that Fisker made.
""With the current state of the EV transition, creating an EV startup would be a very big risk,"" he said. ""Too many players at the high end make it difficult to enter the market and generate higher profits needed to invest in lower-priced models to sell at higher volumes. Add in the higher interest rates today and venture capital is less likely to find its way into a no-name, high-risk startup.""

"Fisker, Maker Of The Ocean SUV, Files For Bankruptcy",https://insideevs.com/news/723669/fisker-inc-bankruptcy-chapter-11-official/,The company filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday and is planning on selling its assets.,6/18/2024 4:27,"The moment Fisker Ocean owners have been dreading is here. Fisker Group Inc., the operating subsidiary of troubled California-based EV startup Fisker Inc., officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware yesterday, citing “various market and macroeconomic headwinds.”
The company said in a statement that it is in “advanced discussions with financial stakeholders regarding debtor-in-possession financing and the sale of its assets.” In other words, the maker of the all-electric Ocean SUV is looking for someone to buy whatever remains of the company after months of turmoil.
What will happen to Fisker?
Designer Henrik Fisker's second venture in the automotive space, Fisker Inc., has been plagued with problems over the last year The company struggled with sales, quality issues, the availability of parts and more. According to our sources, Fisker employees were stripping parts off completed cars in Austria and shipping them to the United States in their personal luggage. It's unclear what will happen to the company's assets now as bankruptcy proceedings begin.
Production of Fisker’s sole product was paused at Magna’s factory in Austria last month as inventory piled up and prices were cut with hopes of getting some much-needed cash. A week later, Fisker’s Austrian subsidiary filed for reorganization, and now the company as a whole is officially going down the bankruptcy route.
More Fisker Stories
This is the second time in just 10 years that owners of a car that bears CEO Henrik Fisker's name have had to go through the uncertainties that are associated with the downfall of the company that built their cars. The first time was when Fisker Automotive, the company that built the Karma extended-range EV, went under in 2014. (The two companies had the same founder, but are separate entities.)
In modern times, Fisker Inc.’s financial woes were clear from the beginning of the year when it became known that the company burned through roughly $70 million per month on average in 2023 for a total of nearly $1 billion. Most EV startups burn immense amounts of capital in their early years, if they can endure them, but Fisker had its own unique challenges with its ""asset-light"" business model: depending on outside contractors to build the cars, while it focused on design and the customer experience. But Fisker spent much of the past year dealing with problems on the sales and repair side: primarily, getting cars to customers, quality issues buyers did not expect from an $80,000 luxury EV, repairing issues that came up and supplying parts for those repairs.
Meanwhile, the company was said to be beset by turmoil within, struggling with cash flow, reportedly mercurial founders, inadequate customer service and being seemingly unprepared for the intense logistics of running a car company.
Originally, Fisker planned on building 20,000 to 23,000 Ocean EVs at its contract manufacturer in Austria but ended up assembling roughly 11,000 in total, with about 5,000 cars still sitting in inventory, according to our calculations.
“Fisker has made incredible progress since our founding, bringing the Ocean SUV to market twice as fast as expected in the auto industry and making good on our promise to deliver the most sustainable vehicle in the world,” said a Fisker spokesperson in the official Chapter 11 announcement.
“We are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers’ hands in both North America and Europe. But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company,” the spokesperson added.
The company said that it would file all the necessary motions to ensure its reduced operations are able to continue, including paying employee wages and benefits, preserving certain customer programs and compensating needed vendors on a go-forward basis.
Fisker boasted that being an ""asset-light"" automaker allowed it to bring its first EV to the market faster than the industry average. But that same mentality could lead to big issues for Ocean EV owners, as the company has a paper-thin stock of spare parts, making simple repairs close to impossible. It could also make the company unattractive to potential buyers, as Fisker doesn't have its own manufacturing facility, instead relying on Magna's manufacturing expertise to put together a working car.

"Pork, Dairy, Booze: China To Hit Europe Back After New EV Tariffs",https://insideevs.com/news/723366/china-retaliatory-trade-tariffs-europe-electric-vehicle/,The Chinese government might slap tit-for-tat trade barriers in retaliation for EU tariffs on EVs.,6/14/2024 13:00,"Chinese companies are urging the government to slap retaliatory measures on European goods after the bloc imposed up to 38% tariffs on China's electric vehicle imports early this week.
Trade tensions between two of the world’s major trading partners have been soaring as China’s EVs are flooding European markets, threatening to uproot domestic players with high-quality and low-cost alternatives. China argues that its EVs are simply superior products and that the tariffs are unfair. As a result, Europe and China are now exchanging trade blows.
Trade war between China and the West.
After the U.S. slapped 100% tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports last month, the European Union followed with its own set of tariffs of up to 38% this week. Far lower than the U.S., but still damaging for an industry operating on slim margins. China, home to the world's largest car market, isn't sitting quietly.
China’s state-owned newspaper, Global Times, reported yesterday that Chinese companies will file an application with authorities to launch an “anti-dumping probe” into certain EU pork and dairy products. Reuters said, citing data from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, that the EU exports dairy products worth $1.8 billion to China annually.
Cars would also be impacted as China is considering hiking tariffs on vehicle imports from the current 15% to 25%. German automakers like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen would bear the brunt of these tariffs when they go into effect as China is by far the largest market in terms of unit sales.
These automakers have deeply invested in China. Certain German models, like the BMW iX3, are exclusively manufactured in China and exported to other countries. Many German automakers have JVs with local players for their Chinese operations. However, several models are imported from Europe, like the Mercedes EQS and EQS SUV, whose prices would soar after retaliatory tariffs.
BMW iX3 (2022)
This comes in addition to similar anti-dumping investigations into European goods announced early this year. Chinese authorities are scrutinizing Brandy and certain plastics that enter China from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Taiwan. Given the government's iron grip over its agencies, it would be difficult to decipher whether these are independent investigations or orchestrated.
Despite opposition from individual member countries and its own automakers, the EU slapped tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese EV imports this week. In an age of thin profit margins, these tariffs would make matters challenging for Chinese manufacturers, many of whom are parent companies of European brands. Geely Group owns Swedish automakers Volvo and Polestar, whereas MG Motors of the U.K. is owned by China’s SAIC.
After the EU slapped the new tariffs, a Chinese auto industry group representing local carmakers said this week that they're not discouraged from continuing to invest in Europe with local plants. Many European countries are enticing Chinese carmakers with subsidies to establish manufacturing to boost local economies and add thousands of jobs.

Elon Musk Claims Victory In Tesla Shareholder Pay Vote (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/723195/tesla-musk-ceo-victory-vote/,The Tesla CEO said that shareholders voted “by wide margins” to approve his $56 billion compensation package. But things are far from over.,6/13/2024 17:12,"Has Tesla CEO Elon Musk already won the controversial shareholder vote to approve his $56 billion pay package?
According to his celebratory posts on his social media network, X, things certainly seem headed in that direction as of Wednesday evening. Though Tesla will announce the final results of the vote at this afternoon's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, the CEO is already claiming victory.
Update 5:10 p.m. June 13: At Tesla's annual investor meeting in Austin tonight, company officials announced that Musk's pay package was indeed approved by shareholders. The original story follows below.
Musk's value and controversy
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, approved in 2018 but rejected by a Delaware judge this year, has been a source of intense controversy. Critics say Musk is distracted by his other ventures and hasn't delivered much for Tesla as of late, while his ardent supporters say he's key to the company's future—which he says will be driven less by cars and more by robotics and AI.
""Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins,"" Musk posted late Wednesday evening. ""Thanks for your support!""
If these results bear out today, they will reaffirm a controversial and unprecedented pay package he was granted in 2018 but that was rejected by a Delaware Chancery Court judge amid a shareholder lawsuit earlier this year. The other resolution would be to incorporate Tesla at its physical headquarters in Texas, not in Delaware, and Musk indicates that measure too is headed for approval.
The outcome, if true, may not be terribly surprising. While a number of large, institutional investment firms like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Glass Lewis opposed Musk's pay package, saying the CEO has been distracted by his many other ventures as of late to the detriment of Tesla, Musk still enjoys immense support among a dedicated fanbase of retail investors.
And even if many of them didn't approve of his leading multiple companies at once—to say nothing of his public antics as of late, or even a Wall Street Journal investigation that came out yesterday and accused him of having sexual relationships with female SpaceX employees—those investors said they didn't want to risk the value of their Tesla shares plummeting if Musk were to leave Tesla. That was an outcome he and Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm strongly hinted at amid a massive public and social media push to get out the vote in Musk's favor.
In other words, if this vote does officially pass today, it's going to be seen as a stamp of approval for Musk's continued leadership of Tesla and his claimed plan to make it ""the most valuable company on earth"" thanks to investments in AI and the pursuit of fully self-driving cars.
However, as CNBC, Bloomberg and others note today, the vote alone does not clear the way for Musk's pay package to be reinstated. That's still working its way through Delaware's courts, which continue to take issue with the fact that Tesla's board of directors isn't a very independent one—although the vote could help tip the legal case in his favor. The company even said in a proxy filing that it ""cannot predict with certainty how a vote to ratify Musk’s compensation would be treated under Delaware law.""
So while Musk's pay package—which he has even said is tied to whether or not he'll stay at Tesla or pursue AI projects ""outside"" of the automaker—may not be settled for some time, today's vote will further cement the idea that ""Tesla is Musk, and Musk is Tesla."" For better or worse.

Shortly after the company announced dismissing some 20,000 employees worldwide, a hiring freeze went into effect. Tesla’s careers page which normally shows thousands of open positions went nearly blank, with just three training program listings.
Tesla's next chapter.
CEO Elon Musk's ambitions for Tesla go far beyond making the world's best electric cars. He wants to solve autonomy and pioneer artificial intelligence and robotaxis. After laying off some 20,000 people worldwide to reduce costs and restructure, Tesla is hiring again.
As the Austin-headquartered company prepares for a future of robotaxis and artificial intelligence alongside its passenger vehicle business, hundreds of those jobs are open again. Service advisors and service technicians make up the majority of the open positions on Tesla’s careers page.
It’s also hiring chemical operators for its in-house lithium refinery located in the greater Corpus Christi area of Texas. A closer look at some of the battery jobs reveals that Tesla is pushing ahead with the development of cells. Several research and development positions are open across “cell materials engineering,” “abuse test and engineering” and “high-voltage abuse test” among other similar roles.
There are also dozens of well-paying positions at Tesla Bot, the automaker’s artificial intelligence and robotics division in charge of fine-tuning the Full-Self Driving (FSD) software and improving the capabilities of its humanoid robots. Positions are also open across manufacturing, legal, operations, software, and more.
However, at the time of publishing, there were no roles open within the charging divisions. The majority of the 500-person Supercharger team that helped build the backbone of Tesla, was also part of the layoffs in April and May. Some of those employees have since been re-hired.
If the company wants to solve autonomy and trigger the next wave of growth—which has been in decline since the start of this year—it needs a lot of these talented people by its side.

"Americans Are Convinced Toyota, Honda, Nissan Lead The Way On EVs: New Survey",https://insideevs.com/news/722987/automakers-tricked-people-electrified-vehicles-evs-survey/,"Years of hybrid cars and ""electrified"" marketing terms have people convinced they're ahead.",6/12/2024 11:00,"BEV, PHEV, HEV, NEV and FCEV are all acronyms for some sort of electrified vehicle, but only one of them refers to all-electric cars. That would be BEV, which stands for battery electric vehicle, whereas all the others have some form of helper, be it a combustion engine or something else.
Furthermore, automakers using “hybridized” and “electrified” every chance they get to describe a car that–in truth–has an electric motor and battery washed away some of the meaning of an electric car.
Electrified doesn't mean all-electric
Automakers have been using every trick in the book to sell as many cars as possible since day one. Now, with the push toward electrification, some brands have turned to catchy words like ""hybridized"" and ""electrified"" to lure people into the world of electric cars, only to offer some sort of combustion engine, too.
We knew it, and you probably knew it, too, but now there’s a survey that uses hard data to show that car manufacturers’ marketing efforts paid off. They managed to fool people into thinking that slapping a badge containing “EV” on the back of their cars made them all-electric.
Toyota C-HR HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) badge
According to New Automotive’s opinion poll of drivers’ views on the EV transition in six countries around the world, the overwhelming majority of people think that an ”electrified” vehicle means “an electric vehicle powered 100% by a battery.” Over 70% of respondents in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, India and Indonesia answered like this, whereas far fewer people gave the true answer.

At the same time, however, the overwhelming majority of respondents said that a vehicle that’s powered 100% by a battery counts as an electric vehicle, which goes to show the scale of confusion among consumers.
Working on the percentage game, where carmakers usually report big increases in sales but bury the actual number of EVs sold in the footnotes, the poll revealed that this tactic also worked. In the US, respondents said that almost all car manufacturers sold more EVs than they actually did, with only Renault (which doesn’t sell cars here) and Mercedes-Benz getting lower estimates from the public.
The same extensive poll revealed that consumers in the target six countries would avoid buying a car from a company that’s associated with lobbying against EV policies and that they’d like manufacturers to be more supportive of the switch to EVs.
The majority of drivers in the UK (58%), France (51%), India (86%) and Indonesia (83%) want their own car brand to support policies to increase EV sales and phase out combustion car sales. In contrast, in the United States, that percentage is 47%. Moreover, 23% of Americans said they want their car brand to oppose such policies.
When it comes to Toyota, a car company famous for its foot-dragging approach to full electrification among EV enthusiasts and for selling only one all-electric car in the U.S., drivers across all countries surveyed tend to think that the Japanese automaker should aim for a higher percentage of EV sales by 2030 compared to its current plan of about 30% or 3.5 million EVs. On average, US drivers said Toyota should aim for 38% EV sales annually by 2030, while respondents in Japan said the company should aim for 52% EV sales.
“These results should give many of the largest car manufacturers pause for thought,” said Ben Nelmes, CEO of New Automotive. “Motorists are increasingly conscious of the impact that cars have on the environment, and they want cleaner cars. Advocating for climate policies to be weakened or watered down not only carries environmental risks but reputational and financial risks, too,” he added.

'Tesla’s Future Relies On His Presence': Musk's $56B Pay Vote Down To The Wire,https://insideevs.com/news/723041/tesla-musk-vote-preview-cm/,"How the Tesla shareholder vote tomorrow will go seems to be anyone's guess. Plus: more on the EU's China tariffs, and GM's Cruise is back.",6/12/2024 10:16,"We're now one day away from the Tesla shareholder vote that will determine the future trajectory of the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, and how it goes is anyone's guess. Will shareholders approve a controversial and legally disputed $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk? And if they don't, will he really walk, as he's often implied?
That kicks off this midweek edition of our Critical Materials morning news roundup, and what a busy week it's been already. Also on tap today: we examine the fallout from Europe's stiff new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, and General Motors' Cruise robotaxi operation gets a new lifeline. Let's dig in.
Elon Musk Cyber Rodeo Texas
Is there a Tesla without Elon Musk at the helm?
Assuredly so. But that's the wrong question to ask. The right question is, what is the stock price of $TSLA without Elon Musk at the helm?
And that question is the one that small retail investors and huge institutional firms alike are asking as they vote on Musk's unprecedented $56 billion pay package. The results of that election will be announced at the company's annual shareholder meeting tomorrow afternoon in Austin.
We've covered the backstory on this before, so I'll spare you the details here. But I will remind you that this vote doesn't negate the Delaware judge's decision to void Musk's pay package after a shareholder lawsuit; it merely gives more ammo for Musk to secure it on an appeal or through some other means.
Plenty of investors big and small are fed up with Musk's public antics, his apparent lack of attention on Tesla as he also runs SpaceX and the social media network formerly called Twitter, and his apparent pivot away from cars toward robotaxis and AI. Other investors may agree with all of that (or they don't!) but still won't want to see the value of their $TSLA shares get wiped out. Analysts predict an immediate decline on the heels of a ""no"" vote, which would go even further south if Musk does leave.
Here's the latest from the Wall Street Journal, including how Musk himself has spent a huge amount of time lobbying for the vote, perhaps even more than he's spent on Tesla itself this year. Emphasis mine:
Votes have been trickling in for weeks but it isn’t yet clear if shareholders will sign off on the package, according to people familiar with the matter. It will come down to how many of Tesla’s individual investors cast ballots, and how big institutional investors vote at the last minute, the people said.
Musk himself has been campaigning to get the vote out, tweeting on his X platform and even attending meetings with some large investors that he usually skips.
[...] Musk was supposed to talk about the future of Tesla, not lobby for his compensation in those meetings, some of the people said. But when asked, Musk has addressed the compensation debate and pitched investors on why Tesla’s future relies on his presence, according to some of the people.
[...] Big institutions, which normally sway the outcome, were split in 2018 and most aren’t expected to change their votes. The vote is expected to come down to individual investors who have flocked to the stock often thanks to Musk himself.
I've been arguing lately that there are really two companies here—Tesla, the carmaker, and $TSLA, the stock with a $543 billion market cap—and more money rides on the latter than the former.
Over at Barron's, Al Root writes that the answer is fairly obvious, and it's a ""yes"" in Musk's favor:
“I find it puzzling that some short sellers think institutions who are long Tesla, and are active managers, would vote no on Elon’s comp plan, which will almost certainly cause Tesla stock to fall and hurt performance,” says Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund co-founder Gary Black. His fund holds Tesla stock.
He has a good point. Large institutions can’t simply trade in and out of large positions. Voting against the package amounts to shooting themselves in the foot.
A no vote could send Tesla stock plummeting toward $150, according to market technicians.
[...]  Wall Street doesn’t vote, but analysts talk with clients that do. At least six brokers including Barclays and Morgan Stanley see re-approval happening. One broker, Bernstein, calls it unlikely.
That would be the short-term reaction. A no vote would force investors to consider Musk’s reaction, while leaving Tesla’s board of directors scrambling to compensate their CEO.
I do wonder how much last night's WSJ investigation into Musk's alleged sexual conduct with his female employees at SpaceX—including reportedly having a relationship with an intern—could move the needle. But at the end of the day, money talks and everything else walks.
If you haven't, I highly encourage you to read InsideEVs' report from Mark Kane this morning on the European Union's new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. The EU's counterpunch to the slew of rising Chinese EV sales is fascinating: it shows that the government body is also hitting back on its own automakers who build in China, like BMW and Dacia, and that not every country was in favor of this plan. They all have to do business with China, after all.
While the tariffs aren't as severe as the new 100% ones imposed by the United States, they do hurt. And they're already hurting shares of European automakers as investors worry about what happens when—more like if—China retaliates. Here's Reuters:
""The tariffs have turned out to be lower than many feared and are initially a plan that can still be revised. The measures are a disaster for European car buyers and for German car manufacturers,"" said Frank Schwope, automotive industry lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences FHM Hannover.
""China is by far the most important sales market for all German car manufacturers. However, French car manufacturers, for whom China is an insignificant market, would benefit from measures against Chinese imports to Europe,"" Schwope added.
Volkswagen and BMW, down around 1-1.8%, were among the worst performers on Germany's blue-chip index. Luxury German manufacturer Porsche Holding (was down over 7% as it traded ex-dividend.
Welcome to the Automotive Cold War, Europeans. Expect it to get a lot uglier, even as the whole world grapples with inflation already.
Eight months after halting operations after a number of disastrous safety mishaps in 2023, GM's Cruise robotaxi operation seems to be... back? Get ready, Phoenix, Dallas and now Houston: it's back. Here's TechCrunch on Cruise's new $850 million investment from GM to kickstart things again:
GM’s CFO Paul Jacobson announced the capital infusion onstage at Deutsche Bank’s Global Automotive Industry Conference on Tuesday.
“This will help bridge Cruise funding until we can find the right long-term capital efficient strategy, including potential new partnerships and external funding,” Tiffany Testo, a spokesperson for the company, told TechCrunch. She declined to elaborate on the types of new partnerships or how much money Cruise hopes to raise.
[...] Patrick Morrisey, VP of corporate communications at GM, told TechCrunch that the reduction in spending is still in effect, despite today’s capital infusion.
“The total reduction in spending announced earlier is based on the fact that Cruise’s total operating costs are lower in 2024 versus 2023 (operations paused for several months, smaller fleet, fewer cities, etc.…” Morrisey said via email, noting that Cruise still needs money to advance its technology. Just not as much.
The quest for fully autonomous driving is going to be a long one, and GM isn't about to give up what it's gained so far.

I'm not even sure where to put the odds anymore, but my current gut feeling is there's at least a 70% chance it will pass and only a 30% chance it won't. How do you see the vote going now?

Europe Hits Back: Chinese EV Imports Face Much Higher Tariffs,https://insideevs.com/news/723025/europe-impose-tariffs-chinese-ev-import/,"The EU penalized companies that didn't ""cooperate"" with the investigation more than others, and even targeted Chinese EVs built by BMW and Tesla.",6/12/2024 8:44,"The European Union will follow the U.S. and impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to defend its industry from what officials called ""unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers."" The move to raise tariffs comes at a time when many ultra-competitive and lower-cost EVs are undercutting European automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz on their home turf.
In the U.S., the tariffs on Chinese EV imports recently quadrupled from 25% to 100%. In the EU, the tariffs were at 10% but now may go as high as 38.1%, according to the provisional conclusion reached by the body.
China outpaced Europe and North America
China is the world's largest plug-in electric car market with sales levels exceeding the rest of the world combined. During the first four months of the year, more than 2.5 million plug-ins have been sold in the country (including 1.65 million EVs), taking 40% of the total volume. At the same time, Europe was under 1 million units (0.6 million EVs) and 21% plug-in share.
The European Commission—the EU's executive arm—had been investigating ""unfair subsidies"" across EV value chains in China for months, claiming that massive government financial assistance from Beijing was key in driving down the cost of cars and production to levels European automakers cannot compete with. The commission also said the new tariffs go into effect as soon as July 4 ""should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution.""
Interestingly, the new EU tariffs will not affect every Chinese EV manufacturer equally. The commission said that some automakers cooperated with the investigation more than others did. Those that were deemed to have participated will see lower tariffs than ones that reportedly did not, according to Reuters.
The new weighted average tariff for the companies who did cooperate in the investigation but have not been will be 21%. Other all-electric vehicle manufacturers, who were said to have resisted the investigation, will face tariffs as high as 38.1%.
Besides those general two categories, there are three individual duties for three known major Chinese producers:
Let's recall that SAIC has several brands such as MG, whose hot-selling MG 4 is quickly displacing purchases of European vehicles. Chinese conglomerate Geely also owns multiple brands, including Volvo, which is now working on how to produce more EV models in Europe, as well as Polestar, Zeekr and Lotus too. Several of those brands' EV models are made in China.
Because the car business usually does not operate on very high margins outside of the luxury segment, even a 5-10% increase makes competition challenging. The companies that will move from 10% to 38.1% tariff will have a really hard time—at least in theory.
None of the numbers above are yet definite. According to Reuters, the anti-subsidy investigation is set to continue until Nov. 2. Then Europe will probably see definitive duties, typically for five years, and maybe more individual duties for sampled manufacturers, including potentially Tesla as well—the Model 3 sold in Europe is made in China, for example.
That brings up an interesting point of this tariff policy: the EU even investigated and targeted its own automakers who also build cars in China and sell them in Europe, like BMW. Both the Bavarian automaker and Tesla are considered ""cooperating companies"" thus far, so they'll only face 21% potential tariffs for now.
Another interesting development is that not all EU countries were happy with the decision. The higher tariffs were opposed by Germany, which is heavily engaged in China; Sweden, which counts China's Geely as the owner of Volvo; and Hungary, which is also working with China on deep investments into things like battery manufacturing.
Now, the major question is whether or not China will retaliate. Counter-tariffs from China could impact the automotive industry or other goods imported from that country. According to the Associated Press, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian ""blasted the EU's investigation as 'typical protectionism' and said Beijing would 'take all measures necessary to protect our legitimate rights and interests.'""

"Volvo EX30, EX90 Production Could Divert To Europe Over China Tariffs: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/722740/volvo-ex30-ex90-production-diverts-to-belgium/,"Europe is adding tariffs on Chinese-made EVs too. Meanwhile, the fate of the U.S.-bound EX30 is unclear.",6/10/2024 9:27,"A month after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles from 27% to 100%, Europe is expected to reveal a similar crackdown on Chinese EVs this week. In anticipation of European tariffs, Volvo has announced that it would divert production of certain models from China to Belgium.
According to anonymous company insiders interviewed by The Times of London, Volvo is diverting the production of the EX30 electric hatchback and EX90 SUV to Belgium to avoid potentially disruptive tariffs that the European Commission is expected to announce soon. Production of U.K.-bound models will also be moved to Belgium, sources close to the company said.
An automotive trade war is brewing between China and the West.
Over the past couple of years, there has been a steady onslaught of cheap, high-quality Chinese EVs in Europe. The European Commission alleges that Chinese EVs are excessively subsidized. China rejects these claims. And now we're expecting a trade war.
Chinese carmaker Geely is the parent company of Volvo. The EX30 is manufactured at a Geely–owned plant in Zhangjiakou in northern China. The EX90 SUV is made at Volvo’s Daqing plant. Thankfully for the U.S. market, the three-row electric EX90 is also made at Volvo's plant in Charleston, South Carolina, so its American sales won't have to deal with any tariff headaches. The fate of the China-built EX30 is less clear.
Diverting the production of both these models to Belgium means Volvo would no longer need to halt their sales in Europe and other markets. That’s something the brand was previously considering, according to the report.
Europe is on the brink of a major trade war with China due to an influx of cheap Chinese EVs that threaten homegrown carmakers. According to a Transport and Environment analysis, one in four EVs sold in Europe this year would be made in China. This includes models from BYD, Polestar, Tesla, MG and more. (The EU is expected to set lower tariffs on made-in-China EVs from BYD, Geely and Tesla, according to Reuters.)
There’s also an ongoing anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese-built EVs by the European Commission. ""Their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market,"" President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech at the European Parliament last year.
However, the broader European auto industry seems opposed to the impending crackdown on Chinese EVs. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have all warned against the tariffs—HSBC estimates that German automakers generate 20-23% of their global profits from their operations in China.
The EX30 is a rare Chinese-made EV available in the U.S. as well. Because Volvo also has U.S. operations, like the South Carolina plant that also exports similar models, it qualifies for tariff refunds, according to trade law experts Reuters spoke to.
That means Volvo has so far offset the costs of those tariffs. Thanks to the cost advantages that come with Chinese manufacturing, the company hit a sweet spot with a $36,000 starting price, making it attractive for cost-conscious EV buyers. However, with tariffs on China-built EVs now at 100% instead of 27.5%, it's not clear if Volvo can absorb the impact like it once planned to.
InsideEVs reached out to Volvo USA last week for clarification on how the new U.S. tariffs affect the EX30, but hasn’t heard back yet.
Meanwhile, globally, the EX30 has been an instant sales hit. In the first Q1 2024, Volvo delivered 14,500 units globally. In May alone, Volvo delivered 11,000 units.
The EX30’s production in Belgium was expected to begin in 2025 after the company announced “strong demand” last year. That plant was expected to play a supporting role in addition to Chinese manufacturing. It now looks like European production will be fast-tracked due to impending tariffs.
Whether Volvo will be able to maintain the cheap $35,000 starting price for the EX30 with European production is something we’ll find out in due course.

VW Will Spend Billions of Its EV Development Budget on Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/722457/vw-invest-billions-gas-engines/,A full third of its nine-figure EV budget will be used to keep gas engines relevant as the switch to EVs slows.,12/25/2024 7:29,"It's fair to say the transition to EVs isn't going as some automakers had projected. Several car manufacturers are delaying their lofty goals to become purely electric in the foreseeable future. Of the €180 billion ($196 billion) set aside in 2023 for research and development, the German brand said it would use more than two-thirds on ""electrification and digitalization.""
Arno Antlitz, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer at the Volkswagen Group, has now clarified where the remaining third will be spent. The company intends to invest roughly €60 billion ($65 billion) to ""keep our combustion cars competitive.""
Speaking at an event held by Reuters in Munich, the CFO and COO added that ""the future is electric, but the past is not over. It is a third and it will stay a third."" As a reminder, the previous plan announced in late 2022 mentioned VW would go fully electric in Europe from 2033.
Last year, VW brand boss Thomas Schäfer referred to ICE as being ""old technology"" in the context of e-fuels. He described the discussions surrounding synthetic fuels as being nothing more than ""unnecessary noise."" That's despite the fact fellow VW Group brand Porsche is actively involved in producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile.
Other high-end marques from the VW empire are also keeping a close eye on how sustainable fuels evolve. Bugatti is even thinking of designing fuel stations that could be installed at the owner's home and filled up with synthetic fuel. Lamborghini believes the combustion engine could be saved by making it run on something other than fossil fuels. Bentley is also exploring nearly carbon-neutral fuels.
Speaking of the Crewe-based marque, Bentley has pushed back its objective to become EV-only by 2030, delaying it by three years. Similarly, Ford no longer thinks it can go entirely electric in Europe by 2030. Aston Martin recently reversed course as well and will continue to produce cars with combustion engines into the next decade.
It's clear that more and more car companies are reevaluating their EV strategies as people aren't willing to let go of ICE just yet. Automakers are in quite a predicament because emissions regulations are getting tighter, requiring investments to make gas engines run cleaner. At the same time, the electric offensive from China is a cause for concern for global players.

General Motors Had Its Best Month Ever For EV Sales In May,https://insideevs.com/news/722280/gm-ev-sales-record-may/,"Yes, really. Even without the Chevy Bolt. Here's how.",6/5/2024 15:47,"An unfortunate thing happened when General Motors discontinued the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV at the end of last year: its total electric vehicle sales cratered. It turns out that when you axe America's most affordable EV, as well as the best-selling EV in your lineup, and your portfolio of new EVs is dogged by production and software issues, well... things don't turn out so great.
Six months later, we might be seeing a very different General Motors. With little fanfare, the automaker just had its best month of all-electric vehicle sales ever in May, an outcome that would've sounded unfathomable not very long ago.
Are GM's EV woes in the past?
Production of GM's Ultium-powered battery cars hit several roadblocks in 2023, as did software issues that took one model off dealer lots for several months. Afterward, GM vowed to turn things around, and preliminary sales data indicates it may be doing exactly that.
GM CEO Mary Barra announced the news during last night's annual shareholder meeting. Curious as to how GM pulled this off even without the Bolt in its lineup, I asked David Caldwell, who directs finance and sales communications for the company, for more information. And he indicated that sales of the rest of the Ultium EV lineup seem to be making up considerable lost ground.
""We’re seeing strong demand and increases basically across the board, in particular Cadillac Lyriq and the new Chevrolet Blazer EV,"" Caldwell said in an email. ""[The] Hummer EV is building volume, as is the Silverado EV. Initial deliveries of the new Equinox EV occurred at the end of May.""
Caldwell added that ""the biggest impact comes from Lyriq,"" which saw more than 3,000 units sold in May. GM's total EV volume in the U.S. and Canada was more than 9,000 vehicles last month too. (According to past data, GM's previous ""best ever"" month for EVs would've been sometime in 2023, and around 7,000 electric units sold.)
It's key to note that we won't get exact details on GM's EV sales for a few more weeks.
Unlike other automakers, GM has reported its sales figures quarterly instead of monthly for the past few years—hence why tracking down its past monthly EV record is tricky. GM officials declined to provide detailed information on EV sales for May. But Caldwell said that the newest quarterly figures will be released around July 2 as the second quarter of 2024 comes to a close.
Still, there are several interesting trends to parse here. As Cadillac's global vice president John Roth told InsideEVs earlier this year, the Lyriq has had considerable ""momentum"" within the luxury brand, and it made up an impressive 17% of Cadillac's total sales in Q1. The Blazer EV also went back on sale after a three-month hiatus following reports of software issues, including by this publication.
Meanwhile, the Equinox EV seems poised to be a promising volume-seller thanks to its $35,000 (after tax credits) price tag and an even more affordable variant coming soon; as Caldwell noted, its sales are just starting to get underway.
GM has even more electric options coming this year, including the entry-luxury Cadillac Optiq, Escalade IQ and GMC Sierra EV. Sales of the consumer-spec Silverado EV are also just now starting to ramp up as well.
At the same time, GM too seems to be feeling the heat of an EV market that's less even and predictable than the auto industry imagined. High interest rates and fears around range and charging may keep more next-wave EV adopters away for now. Barra herself has begun admitting that an industrywide EV transition may actually take decades, and Cadillac has reversed course on phasing out internal combustion by the start of the 2030s.
Nonetheless, this news—limited in detail though it may be for now—is an outstanding development for GM and for the wider EV market. The automaker promised an electric turnaround for 2024, and it seems to making good on that right now. The General is also locked in a tight race with Hyundai Motor Group and Ford to see which company can collectively sell more than 100,000 EVs in a year, a feat only accomplished by Tesla so far.
If GM can keep delivering with this expanded EV lineup, it runs an extremely good chance of getting there next.

‘Foot On The Accelerator’: Hyundai And Kia’s EV Push Pays Off As Rivals Back Down,https://insideevs.com/news/721958/hyundai-kia-ev-sales-may/,"As American production looms, the Korean automakers race ahead with EVs. Hyundai’s American CEO says they’re just getting started.",6/3/2024 17:30,"Call it the “cold feet” era of the electric vehicle race.
Since the latter part of the last decade, nearly every major car company made a big show of their aggressive plans to expand their electric lineups, with some even committing to going all-EV. But for a lot of reasons, that path is proving considerably more difficult and protracted than they expected.
Hyundai, Kia pull ahead
The electric race is proving to be a kind of chicken race, but Korea's automakers say they aren't blinking—and have big plans reset what they do through battery-powered cars.
Dealer networks have been reticent to get on board. High interest rates have turned buyers off to EVs’ often more expensive prices, as have continued concerns about charging. Some new models have gotten lukewarm receptions from longtime fans. Pivoting their century-old industry to one focused on batteries and software has been exceptionally tough, and investors have balked at the enormous capital costs involved.
And with the world’s top EV seller seemingly focused on AI and robotaxis instead—not to mention a looming U.S. presidential election where one candidate seems dead-set against the technology—many automakers may be seeing this moment as one where they can ease off the accelerator a bit.
But easing off isn’t in the cards at Hyundai, the Korean automaker’s American CEO told InsideEVs recently. And the proof has been reflected in sales numbers that fuel plans for future growth.
“We're sticking firm with our plans and our long-term electrification strategy,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker said in an interview. “No pun intended, but we're gonna keep our foot on the accelerator. If consumers start to think about purchasing any EV, I want them to consider Hyundai first.”
Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor America CEO
The success of Hyundai has proven to be a kind of bright spot in an uneven and unpredictable year for EV adoption. And the same has been true lately of its corporate sibling Kia.
Both brands have had good news to share in recent weeks. May brought Hyundai its best month ever for the Ioniq 5 crossover, with sales up 82% over the same period last year. Kia had a similar “best month ever” story for all of its electric vehicle sales, including the critically acclaimed EV9 three-row crossover.
Even the Kia EV6—whose facelifted version has not yet gone on sale—has seen a significant increase in year-to-date sales over 2023. And while it’s about a year away from sales in North America, the compact Kia EV3 has already made a big splash with prospective buyers seeking more affordable electric options.
And all of that is before the Hyundai Motor Group’s big North American production push, which begins in earnest soon. The first Kia EV9 rolled off the assembly line last week at the automaker’s West Point, Georgia plant. The following day, Hyundai announced the Ioniq 5 would be made at the new joint “Metaplant” in the same state as well later this year. (Hyundai and Kia are both owned by the Hyundai Motor Group; while they share hardware, top corporate leadership and some production facilities, they operate as separate entities.)
“With model development in line with consumer needs and strong vehicle supply, Kia continued its sales growth momentum in May,” said Eric Watson, Kia America’s vice president of sales, in a recent news release. “Kia offers a balanced mix of electric, hybrid and ICE models that are meeting customer demands, and we expect to see increased showroom traffic and transactions through dealers.”
Parker said that Hyundai’s EV lineup is already being heavily advertised in a new campaign airing during the NBA playoffs. While other automakers have taken pains in recent months to play up their hybrid lineups—”Which we have,” Parker said—as EV sales have ups and downs, the CEO said right now Hyundai wants to “drive the EV narrative.”
“At the end of the day, if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, it's got to be done through EVs,” Parker said. “I don't think any [automaker] right now is really touting EVs as performance vehicles like we are.” And the hybrids are doing well too, especially the Santa Fe Hybrid crossover; “Hotter than a pistol, can't keep them in stock right now,” he said.
2025 Kia EV6
And like Kia, which openly admits that it “relaunched the brand” in 2021 with a new logo and cars like the EV6, Hyundai is also using its electric cars to get people to think differently about a company once known for cheap subcompacts. High electric ranges, compelling designs and Tesla-rivaling battery tech have changed a lot of perceptions about both brands.
“Ultimately, what we're trying to do is improve the brand image, the awareness and the consideration for the brand,” Parker said. “But at the same time, we want to make sure that we give consumers confidence when they purchase an EV from us.”
For that, he said, “the proof is in the pudding.”
“We're adding American manufacturing jobs,” Parker said. “And we're addressing the top EV concerns, the number one of which is the purchase price.”
Indeed, cars like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 have been known for their aggressive lease deals. As of this writing, the crossover—which offers up to 303 miles of range—can be leased for $229 a month and $3,500 due at signing for an SEL model. The Ioniq 6 sedan can be had in 361-mile SE form for just $189 a month and $1,999 down, which gets a buyer one of the higher-range EVs on the market right now at any price.
Leasing has been a big hit for Hyundai, Parker said. Around 60% to 70% of both EVs get leased, he added, which is much higher than the brand’s other cars. (He declined to elaborate on leasing rates for other Hyundai models but said they are ""much, much lower."") He has told InsideEVs in the past that both models continue to be profitable at those lease prices, although the extent of their margins is unclear.
That situation is also born out of necessity. Because the Ioniq models are currently built in Korea and not North America, they do not qualify for the $7,500 EV tax credits unless they are leased—contrary to what the automaker believed would be the case with the Biden Administration’s new rules. After that decision happened, Hyundai’s EV sales began to lag behind those of Ford, but these leasing deals have helped propel the Korean company back to the front of the race.
As Bloomberg recently reported, Ford, General Motors and Hyundai could each hit 100,000 EVs produced this year, something only Tesla has done to date. (Reaching that sales mark, however, may be a different story; with a total of 20,971 Ioniq vehicles sold by the end of May, it may only be achievable if Kia’s results are counted as well. Neither brand breaks out sales data for electric versions of its gas vehicles, like the Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona Electric.)
At the same time, GM is just now ramping up production of more affordable models like the Blazer EV and Equinox EV after a year of technical headaches. And while Ford continues to post strong sales of its F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E, adoption isn't happening as fast as it predicted, and now the Blue Oval brand is pushing back plans for future models and singing a different tune about hybrids. In other words, the race to 100,000 EVs could be Hyundai and Kia's to lose.
And the Metaplant in Georgia could be their ace in the hole. Due to go online in October, the Savannah-area factory has a capacity to build up to 300,000 Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs annually, adding more than 8,000 jobs in the coming years.
And that situation around tax credits and leasing is evolving quickly. With the EV9 and soon Ioniq 5 being U.S.-built, both cars should eventually be able to qualify for at least some of the tax credits when purchased.
Parker seemed confident that would be the case for the Ioniq 5, but wants to wait until the ink is dry; “If they were coming off [the production line] now, they would qualify, but I can never predict the future,” he said.
Hyundai Seven Concept
Even if Hyundai’s EV models somehow don’t get the tax credit, Parker said plans continue unabated. Unlike competitors, plans for new models aren’t being pushed back. Hyundai is still on track to release a three-row crossover called either the Ioniq 7 or Ioniq 9 later this year.
And while the company hasn’t said where it’s going to be built, the success of the similar Kia EV9 in the U.S. and this country’s endless appetite for three-row crossovers makes it seem like an obvious contender.
Parker declined to give more details about that crossover, or speak to what could become an inter-family rivalry between Hyundai and Kia for market share in the electric three-row space. But he did say it’s worth waiting for. “We've got high expectations, and we think the car is gonna perform extremely well,” he said.

Most Americans Would Still Buy ICE Vehicles And Hybrids Over EVs: Survey,https://insideevs.com/news/721896/americans-buy-ice-over-evs/,There seems to be a gap between automakers’ EV sales expectations and the reality of the car-buying public's preferences.,6/3/2024 13:30,"Even though Americans seem open to buying electric vehicles and automakers are enthusiastically pushing them to market and announcing grand electrification plans, we still have a long way to go until mass EV adoption. Several studies have been conducted over the last few years that have suggested American car buyers would much rather pick a pure combustion car or a hybrid over an EV, and a new survey seems to confirm not much has changed.
KPMG posted the results of its first-ever American Perspective Survey, which compiled the answers of 1,100 adults across the country and 400 additional people from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. Among the many insights it provides is a look at Americans’ desire to buy an electric car to help with the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Car buyers would rather pump gas than plug in
While there have never been as many car buyers in the US who are considering an electric vehicle, they're still about one in five, which is a lot less than in China with its much broader spectrum of available EVs.
Only 20% (or one in five) of those questioned said they would choose an electric vehicle over a combustion or hybrid car. The largest proportion of respondents (38%) said they would still buy a pure-combustion car, while 34% said they would opt for a hybrid. The propensity toward buying hybrids was slightly higher on the West Coast, where 43% of buyers said they would get a hybrid.
According to the survey, one of the main reasons people wouldn’t buy an electric car today is that they would spend too much time waiting for it to charge. It found that 60% of respondents wanted EVs whose batteries could be charged in 20 minutes, which is currently only a handful of the electric models available on the market—the Hyundai Ioniq 6.
However, the Ioniq 6 is one of the quickest-charging EVs available (thanks to its 800-volt architecture), and it takes 18 minutes to charge from 10 to 80%. This can only be achieved in ideal conditions with a powerful enough charger, so it also depends on the performance of the EV charging network.
One significant omission of this study seems to be the cost of EVs. There are hardly any affordable EVs in America, and the prospect of getting sub-$20,000 models on the market in the near future is unlikely (although a plan appears to be taking shape). Another recent survey paints a slightly different and more nuanced picture of Americans’ car-buying preferences. It suggests people would consider EVs if more affordable models were available, even if they came from China.
The Chinese car market is an interesting case study from another big car market, where the shift from combustion to electric has been much quicker. One of the big reasons more Chinese buyers are considering EVs is that they have many more models to choose from over a much broader price range, which starts at under $10,000 for a fully-fledged small car like the popular BYD Seagull.

"Tesla Semi Impressions, Production Timeline Announced At ACT Expo",https://insideevs.com/news/720980/tesla-semi-first-ride-spec/,"After several false starts, Tesla aims for volume production of the Semi in 2026.",6/1/2024 12:00,"Since its initial reveal in 2017, the Tesla Semi has remained elusive. The long haul truck was initially slated for production in 2019, but has been plagued by delays. The first trickle of deliveries finally began in December 2022, but between then and Q1 2024, less than 150 units were produced.
Most production has gone directly to Tesla's company fleet. PepsiCo is the only Semi customer to actually take delivery, although only 34 of the 100 orders placed by PepsiCo have been fulfilled so far.
So last month, Tesla took the stage at the 2024 Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT) in Las Vegas to assure the world that the Semi is still on track, even if progress is moving more slowly than expected. Senior Manager Dan Priestley says Tesla is committed to the electrification of the trucking industry, stating that they “look forward to bringing our experience with EVs and supporting infrastructure to tackle electric heavy trucking at scale.”
At the event, Priestley also announced that an additional 50 Semis would soon join PepsiCo’s fleet. This news follows reports that big box retailers Costco and Walmart have also launched pilot programs.
Of course, this is just a preamble to the automaker’s future ambitions. Last year, the company announced a $3.6 billion factory to support Tesla Semi production in Nevada. Construction of the facility began in January of this year. Mr. Priestley says Tesla is aiming for volume production in 2026, eventually producing as many as 50,000 units a year.
Hands-on and test-ride experiences were also available at the show. Kyle from the YouTube channel Out of Spec Reviews got to experience the Semi up close for the first time. While his presentation is light on technical details, it provides a good overview of the truck’s features and capabilities.
One of the first things Kyle showcases is the storage area located behind the main cabin. This is accessed via an exterior hatch situated just behind the main cabin door. While the Tesla Semi has a lot of space in the cabin, there is a lack of dedicated storage. So, this storage solution will certainly come in handy for drivers.
We also get a quick look at the Semi's Megawatt Charging System (MCS) port. The MCS charging standard can transfer a whopping 3.75 megawatts of power to large electric vehicles like the Semi. While early units of the Semi feature an MCS v.2 plug, future production will employ the newer v.3 design.
The unusual center seating position remains the interior's most standout feature. The rest of the styling, displays, and user interface will be familiar to anyone who has driven a Tesla. One interesting tidbit is that over the past 1,800 miles, this particular truck’s efficiency has been 1.7 kWh / mile. Although it is unknown whether these miles were tallied while hauling freight, the numbers are in line with what Tesla promised for the vehicle when carrying cargo.
While Out of Spec was able to spend time riding shotgun in the Semi, they couldn’t film the experience. Thankfully, Andre from the TFL was allowed to record his ride-along.
After one of Tesla’s engineers takes the wheel of the Semi, Andre is given a rundown of the truck and its capabilities. Currently, the long-range model is still the only version to enter production. Sporting a massive battery pack estimated at 850 - 900 kWh, the Semi has a tri-motor configuration and over 1,000 hp.
A single motor “efficiency drive” axle is located in the rear and operates at all times. A dual-motor “torque-drive” axle is located in front and provides most of the truck’s power under heavy load. This front axle is utilized only when necessary, sitting dormant whenever possible to improve efficiency.
Since Andre has his own commercial driver’s license, he immediately notes the calm and quiet cabin experience compared to a traditional diesel engine. The cabin is also free of the creaks and rattles you often find in ICE truck platforms converted to hybrid or electric drive. The familiar Tesla user interface is also appreciated, as is the truck’s large, easy-to-access door located on the back side of the cab.
“I got to say, it seems very refined."" Andre says. ""Very nice as far as how the cab is built, the accessibility of it, the capability of it.” While he may not have been behind the wheel, he was impressed with the Semi’s ride, range, and charging capabilities.
Still, he notes that the limited availability of megawatt charging holds back its current potential. “I would say for shorter trips, it’s hard to beat. For cross-country trips, it’s a different story.”
With missed production goals and slow deliveries, there is no doubt that the Semi has had a rough launch. But it is good to see progress on the Nevada production facility and a new batch of trucks on their way to customers.
Do you think Tesla will finally hit volume production in 2026 as planned? Or are we looking at another false start? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Genesis Will Use Lucid Electric Motors In Its Upcoming Electric Convertible: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/721635/genesis-hyundai-lucid-motors-report/,"Lucid Motors already has deals with Aston Martin and Formula E, so it’s no surprise that other companies are reaching out.",5/31/2024 13:00,"Lucid Motors, the maker of the Air luxury electric sedan, is also in the business of making and selling electric motors to other companies. The American startup is the official supplier of front e-motors to Formula E teams, and Aston Martin recently shook hands with Lucid to get its hands on ready-made motors for its upcoming EVs.
Now, Genesis, Hyundai Motor Group’s luxury brand, will reportedly do the same, at least for its upcoming flagship electric convertible.
The EV puzzle
Compared to a conventional gas-powered car that has thousands of moving parts, an electric vehicle is much simpler. There are just a few major components and most of them can be outsourced from other companies. Now, Genesis, Hyundai Motor Group's luxury brand, seems to be doing just that.
According to South Korea’s Sisa Journal (via Drive Tesla Canada), Genesis is in the final stages of negotiations to buy a batch of electric motors from Lucid Motors. Even though Hyundai is neck-deep in creating its own modular electric platforms and drive units, the source claims the timing doesn’t allow Genesis to fit its in-house developed motors in time for launch.
Officials from both Lucid and Genesis declined to comment on any potential future product news.

"EVs Or Hybrids? At Jeep, The Future Is Whatever You Want It To Be",https://insideevs.com/news/721697/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-gladiator/,"""We’ll either amp up, or maybe pump the brakes on where the [EV] technology adoption rate is, and let the customer choose,"" a Jeep exec says.",5/31/2024 9:34,"The brand behind America’s best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle has a lot more coming on the electrified front. And the menu of options will be pretty long.
This week, Jeep introduced the production Wagoneer S, the brand’s first battery-electric vehicle intended for global sales, at an event in New York City. During the unveiling, recently-appointed Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa also confirmed that, by the end of 2025, the Jeep Gladiator truck, Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer will all offer optional 4xe plug-in hybrid options.
Jeep's electrification strategy
Jeep is new to the fully electric space, but its plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe has proven extremely popular. It will run the same playbook in the next few years as more EVs and hybrids get added to the family.
By 2027, Filosa said, Jeep will have two BEV offerings—Wagoneer S and boxier and more rugged-looking Recon—several 4xe range-extended hybrids, and conventional internal-combustion vehicles. Which propulsion technology will define Jeep’s future? The answer, for now, seems to be a definitive “we’ll see.”
“The priority, first and foremost, is growth,” Bill Peffer, Senior Vice President and Head of Jeep Brand, North America, told InsideEVs at the Wagoneer S media preview. “We’re doing it through a strategy of freedom of choice. We’ll either amp up or maybe pump the brakes on where the [EV] technology adoption rate is, and let the customer choose.”
Growth is a bit of a concern for Jeep at the moment. To set the stakes for this diverse electrification strategy, it’s key to note that Jeep’s plan to move more upmarket, often with $100,000+ SUVs, has largely backfired. As a result of these increased prices—and with no small thanks to rising interest rates—Jeep has seen a steep sales decline in recent years. U.S. Jeep sales were down more than 300,000 cars in 2023 from their peak in 2018, a trend Filosa and his team are urgently trying to reverse.
But Jeep is going to do that in ways that don’t involve as many of the big, gas-guzzling engines it depended on in past decades.
During a keynote speech preceding the unveiling of the Wagoneer S, Filosa told journalists that Jeep currently offers models in about 45% of vehicle segments—and the company wants to reach 85%. The all-electric Wagoneer S aims to compete in the “premium midsize utility vehicle” market, one rung above the current Grand Cherokee. (That may also inform why Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares announced a $25,000 electric Jeep model, but that vehicle is probably years away.)
2023 Jeep Wrangler Willys 4xe
“This is the first time we’ve offered a fully battery-electric version of a Jeep,” Peffer said. “We can expand and try to conquest some of our [EV] competition—they're big and we won't name 'em, but we've got our eyes on who else is competing in that space, and we want some of it.” In new ads, the Wagoneer S is clearly aimed at the Tesla Model Y, so even if Peffer won’t say it, it’s picking a fight with the biggest guy in the yard.
The trick, according to Peffer, is to enter this new territory without disrupting the conventional Jeep customer. “It’s exciting for us because with our existing lineup, we already enjoy some of the highest loyalty. Grand Cherokee's got the highest loyalty in the segment, over 35 percent. So we don't want to abandon our customer base.”
The Wagoneer S is built on Stellantis’ new STLA Large platform, a modular architecture destined to underpin products from Dodge, Jeep, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, and Maserati. Despite its name, it is mechanically unrelated to the current gas-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.
STLA Large was designed “from the bottom up” as a BEV platform, Peffer told InsideEVs, but the architecture can accommodate hybrid and internal-combustion drivetrains too—and at the Wagoneer S launch event, Jeep representatives were quick to indicate that the company is willing to pivot to whichever propulsion system fits the moment.
“We're not trying to be evasive, but we're looking at the dynamic of where the market is,” Peffer said. “We’re not the first into this [EV] space, there are other competitors already there. So we’ve learned a bit, we’ve watched the industry, we’ll watch what happens in the segment, [and] we can amp up or we can throttle back a bit.”
A similar strategy is playing out across the rest of the Stellantis family of brands. The new Ram 1500 Ramcharger uses a version of one STLA electric platform with a gas engine as a range extender, and Fiat is also adding an engine back into the previously all-electric new 500. While the conglomerate is going big into the all-electric space after years of lagging behind some rivals, it’s also building in ways to hedge its bets. That may not sit well with the hardcore EV faithful, but the success of the plug-in Wrangler 4xe may show that the company is onto something.
Asked specifically about the possibility of a Wagoneer S with a range-extending internal combustion engine, Peffer was noncommittal. “I can't confirm a specific technology like a range extender, but the flexibility of STLA provides opportunities which are interesting, right? The platform's built to allow for that flexibility and move as the market moves.”

The U.S. Government Wants A Competition To Build One",https://insideevs.com/news/721571/competition-to-build-16000-dollar-american-ev/,"The sub-$10,000 BYD Seagull has made American automakers restless. A U.S. official has ideas on building our version of it.",5/30/2024 12:30,"The sub-$10,000 BYD Seagull is a tour de force representing China’s strong lead in the global EV market. Some of the cheapest EVs in the U.S.—like the Nissan Leaf—cost three times as much before tax credits. Now, a member of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (Arpa-E), a technology incubator under the U.S. Department of Energy, said that doing things differently could help the U.S. build a Seagull fighter.
Halle Cheeseman, a program manager overseeing next-generation battery programs at Arpa-E, told The Information that a potential solution to spur innovations is to host a competition to develop a high-quality U.S.-manufactured EV that would cost approximately $12,000 to build and retail for around $16,000.
High costs jeopardize EV adoption. But low-cost EVs seem imminent.
The high purchase price of EVs has obstructed the wider adoption of climate-friendly electric cars. Expensive batteries and capital-intensive development and production contribute the most to this problem. But things are slowly streamlining and EVs might reach price parity with gas cars sooner than we think.
Cheeseman's proposal, presented at an Arpa-E conference in Dallas last week, underscores the growing concern among U.S. officials about the influx of inexpensive Chinese EVs into the American market. There now appears to be a genuine desire to take steps beyond just imposing tariffs on Chinese imports.
The Seagull is the result of China’s vast local and national subsidies, manufacturing scale and its stranglehold on the battery supply chain. BYD also has one of the highest amounts of vertical integration of any automotive company. Most of its parts, including the chips and the battery, are manufactured in-house.
“We are being beaten, and we're being beaten badly,” Cheeseman told the news outlet. “We need to do something differently.” According to him, the U.S. can tackle this problem by accelerating the adoption of robotics and 3D parts printing in factories, increasing the role of utility companies in battery ownership and leaning on technologies such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G).
Broadly speaking, robotics can enhance precision and efficiency, reduce labor costs and minimize production line errors. 3D printing could speed up the production of complex parts. Together, these systems may enable more efficient production lines and potentially create lighter, more efficient EVs, all contributing to lower overall costs.
But they come with high initial investments, and their integration could be a nightmare—something evident in the Tesla Model 3’s “production hell” era.
Cheeseman said Arpa-E’s senior management could take a year to select a concept as an official program. The program could last up to three years, during which $30 million would be distributed among competing teams. If a team’s solution seems truly promising, they’re given a chance to scale up.
Proposals like the affordable EV could take up to a decade to reach commercial scale and are contingent on how fast automakers incorporate any breakthroughs.
Another potential solution is letting utilities pay for and own the battery pack, which could drive down the purchase price for consumers. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which can feed power back into the local grid from an EV’s battery pack during emergencies or power cuts, could reduce the need for traditional powerplants, according to Cheeseman.
V2G is in a nascent phase, with a handful of EVs like the Nissan Leaf and Ford F-150 Lightning offering the feature. Even then, local utility companies must conduct necessary compatibility upgrades for the grid to accept power from an EV’s battery.
The U.S. is on track to witness several affordable EVs starting as soon as 2025 and 2026. These EVs would be more expensive than Cheeseman’s $16,000 target, but still cheaper compared to today’s prices. And they would likely arrive much faster than a direct Seagull fighter ever could—unless some breakthrough alters the whole landscape.
Tesla is working on affordable models, General Motors recently said that the next-gen Bolt EV would be its cheapest EV, Stellantis confirmed this week that a $25,000 Jeep was on its way and Volkswagen’s $21,000 EVs will premier in 2027.
Whether through government-funded programs or private-sector initiatives, cheap EVs are coming.

Volkswagen Dealers Say The ID.7 Wouldn’t Be Competitive In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/721535/volkswagen-id7-delay-dealers-uncompetitive/,"Even though the ID.7 didn’t have an official price tag for the U.S., dealers feel like it would have been a $50,000+ EV.",5/30/2024 8:42,"The Volkswagen ID.7 was supposed to arrive at dealers in the United States toward the end of this year, but the German company delayed the electric liftback’s launch here because of “changing market dynamics."" Now, American dealers are chiming in and saying that they mostly support the move, as a flagship mid-size five-door EV would be a tough sell stateside, especially considering a hypothetical starting price of $50,000.
Add in the fact that the ID.7 is built in Germany, meaning the $7,500 federal tax credit when purchasing is out of the discussion, and you get a slow-selling car even before the first units set sail from Europe.
The ID.7's course
The Volkswagen ID.7 electric liftback was supposed to replace both the Passat and Arteon in the United States. Now, its future here is uncertain as the market for a $50,000+ mid-size sedan that isn't a Mercedes-Benz, Audi or BMW doesn't really exist, according to VW dealers interviewed by Automotive News.
The vast majority of Volkswagen dealers in the United States support the delay of the ID.7, according to John Luciano, owner of Street Volkswagen in Amarillo, Texas, and a member of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council.
More ID.7 Stories
""We brought up a little bit of caution behind it,"" Luciano told Automotive News. ""Are we sure this is a good idea? We didn't know the exact pricing, but [it's] definitely a $50,000 to $60,000 car, without incentives. Is there any chance of it being competitive? And we felt like [it's] not.""
Anthony Scala, co-owner of City Auto Group, which has three Volkswagen dealerships in the Chicago area, said that the ID.7 hasn’t spurred the interest of prospective buyers as the ID.Buzz minivan that’s slated for delivery in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.
""I just don't think an expensive electric sedan is in the cards for most Americans right now,"" Scala said. ""North of $50,000 for a sedan that doesn't have the star logo, the ring logo or the BMW logo?"" Scala added, referring to Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW. ""It's a non-starter.""
Moreover, in recent years in the U.S., Volkswagen has struggled to sell sedans, period. While the Jetta remains perennially popular, the Passat was discontinued amid slow sales. The ID.7 was billed as an effective replacement for the Arteon sedan, but that was never terribly popular, either. VW has shifted its lineup to being largely SUV-focused in response.
In Europe, the ID.7 has been on sale since last year and, according to Volkswagen, it has seen higher-than-expected demand, especially in its home country of Germany. In North America, however, the delay didn’t come with a revised launch date, leaving prospective customers and dealers alike in the dark.
The ID.7 was billed as a 2025 model, but as John Luciano said, the recent delay will likely push the electric liftback’s launch back at least one model year. This might turn out to be either very good for business, or another nail in the ID.7’s U.S. coffin. If VW rethinks its pricing and features strategy, it could be a winner.
If the car is just being delayed to wait out the perceived EV adoption slowdown and then launched as-is, it will already be a two-year-old model, albeit a very comfortable one, as we found out during our Euro review of it.",Iulian Dnistran
"More Fisker Layoffs Reportedly Hit Software, Design, Content Teams",https://insideevs.com/news/721469/fisker-layoffs-may-2024/,"The extent of the layoffs at the embattled EV startup is not currently known, but they come just after another recent wave of cuts.",5/29/2024 18:10,"The problems facing embattled EV startup Fisker have only mounted as the year has gone on, with the automaker seeing an indefinite end to production of its Ocean crossover, the closure of its California headquarters and multiple rounds of layoffs. More job cuts happened today as well, according to multiple social media postings and former employees.
Fisker In Trouble
The EV startup, helmed by designer Henrik Fisker, aimed to outsource car production to external partners while focusing on software, design, customer service and more. But the company has struggled with delivering cars, high-profile repair and quality issues, its sales model and cash flow. Fisker has recently warned it faces the possibility of bankruptcy.
An undetermined number of Fisker employees reported losing their jobs today on LinkedIn, Reddit and other platforms. Those now-former employees worked in multiple departments, including design, social media, content, software, digital products and service. Many say they were notified via email this morning. Three former Fisker employees who have spoken to InsideEVs in the past confirmed that they heard of today's cuts from their old co-workers.
A Fisker spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the reports, saying the company ""[does not] comment on internal employee matters.""
Get in touch.
If you were impacted by today's reported Fisker layoffs, or have information to share, contact us at from a safe, non-work device. We are happy to speak anonymously and securely.
Fisker has instituted several rounds of job cuts this year as its future looks increasingly in doubt. Last week, Business Insider reported that the company was eliminating positions with the goal of going down to only a ""mission critical"" staff; it is unclear whether today's reported layoffs were part of the same round as those, or are part of some different process.
While the EV startup world is immensely challenging, Fisker has faced particular headwinds since last year.
The company's Ocean crossover—styled by namesake CEO and co-founder Henrik Fisker, who also penned the BMW Z8 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage—initially debuted to promising reviews. Built in Austria by contract auto factory Magna Steyr, the Ocean was meant to be the first of several electric Fisker models produced by outside partners, ostensibly freeing the company up to focus on software, design and the overall customer experience.
But Fisker ran into multiple challenges in 2023 alone, including struggles to get cars delivered to customers, quality issues, accounting problems, complaints about customer service, cash burn and more. In late April, the company announced it could seek bankruptcy protection within the next month, but that outcome hasn't yet come to pass.
Meanwhile, Magna Steyr has halted production of the Ocean, and owners who bought a once-$70,000 EV have been left with countless questions about their resale values and long-term support.

Geely, which owns several established names such as Volvo and Lotus, as well as other self-made brands like Polestar and Zeekr, overtook Germany’s Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW to secure the 10th spot on the list with its sales volume increasing 27% year-over-year. In the first quarter of last year, Geely was in 12th place globally.
Toyota Motor topped the global sales chart in Q1 2024 by selling 2.52 million vehicles (5% down year-over-year), followed by Volkswagen Group with 2.1 million cars (up 3%) and Hyundai Motor Group with 1.76 million vehicles (down 2%).
Other Chinese companies are also catching up. Even though Q1 included the extended Lunar New Year holiday, which usually means stores are closed and sales are slow, BYD, Changan Automobile, Chery Automobile and SAIC Motor all secured a place in the global top 20 sales chart. Together, the five Chinese players saw their combined sales volume increase more than 20% year-over-year while the overall sales growth for the top 20 automakers was just 2%.
The Lotus Eletre (top left), Volvo EX30 (top right) and Polestar 2 (bottom) are all made by companies owned by Geely.
Volvo, which is part of the Geely Group, had its sales increase by 12%, while BYD recorded a 13% uptick. The main driver for these numbers was exports, Nikkei Asia wrote, pouring more fuel on the fire that was billed by the West as “the threat of Chinese EVs.” Geely saw its overseas sales rise by 43% in Q1, while BYD recorded a massive increase of 150%.
In the whole of 2023, China exported 1.2 million so-called new energy vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids and full-on EVs), a 78% increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, experts estimate that China will see its battery-powered vehicle exports rise to 3.5 million next year.",Iulian Dnistran
‘Tesla Is Not A Family Business': New York Official Blasts Musk’s Pay Package,https://insideevs.com/news/720808/nyc-comptroller-brad-lander-tesla-shareholder-vote/,A June shareholder vote will decide how much control Elon Musk wields over Tesla. NYC Comptroller Brad Lander has something to say about it.,5/24/2024 11:30,"The drama at Tesla appears to be unending. Following a disappointing first quarter of sales, mass layoffs, a major safety recall of the Cybertruck and concerns over the company's apparent pivot to robotaxis, another big flashpoint has been lingering for the Austin-headquartered company: CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion payday.
In January, the Delaware Court of Chancery revoked a pay package for Musk originally approved in 2018. “The approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed,” the post-trial opinion read. Tesla's board is now requesting investors to vote again in favor of Musk at the annual general meeting on June 13, along with several other proposals.
Elon Musk seeks larger control over Tesla.
He wants to control 25% of Tesla, up from the 20.5% stake that he currently has. This, he says, would help the company solve autonomy and pivot towards artificial intelligence and robotaxis, eventually leading to ""transformative growth."" Some shareholders aren't buying this narrative. They want Tesla's board to be more independent, and the brand to continue focusing on EVs.
Musk has said that if he does not get a package that comes with a large amount of corporate voting power, he may undertake AI and robotics projects ""outside of Tesla""—a move many longtime $TSLA shareholders fear could tank the share price.
However, some shareholders are fiercely opposing this compensation plan, arguing that Tesla’s board of directors lacks sufficient independence and that Musk is not fully focused on the company.
The coalition opposing Musk's pay package includes the Comptroller of the City of New York, several NYC pension funds, and seven investment firms. New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander, an independently elected official who oversees the city's public pension funds and their investments in companies including Tesla, wrote an official letter urging his peers to vote against Musk's pay package.
He also called upon shareholders to vote against the reelection of Musk’s younger brother Kimbal Musk and former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, on the board of directors.
“We're not saying [Musk] doesn't deserve anything. He deserves a fair pay package, but it needs to be negotiated by a meaningfully independent board,” Lander told InsideEVs in an interview this week.
The Delaware court said that the plan was the largest pay package ever for the CEO of a public company, some 250 times larger than the average and over 33 times larger than the plan’s closest comparison, which was Musk’s prior compensation plan.
“The board is not providing independent governance on behalf of the shareholders, simply reflecting the point of view of the CEO and his family members,” Lander said. “If you want to have a family business, have a family business, and don't do an IPO. If you want to be publicly traded, then the rules apply here,” he added.
It's key to note that Lander's opinion, while shared by many Tesla shareholders and even critics, is far from the prevailing one. Many retail investors have indicated they will vote for Musk's compensation plan. Meanwhile, the company has ""pulled out all the stops"" to get the package approved, including advertisements, statements from its board chair and online drives.
In recent months, Musk has veered Tesla away from things like vehicle product development and new consumer models to focus more on advancing and proliferating its Full Self-Driving system.
He believes that for the company to achieve transformative growth, it needs to solve self-driving while pivoting towards artificial intelligence and robotaxis. But this group of shareholders isn’t swayed by this approach.
“We need Tesla to succeed as an EV car company,” Lander said. “That is an important part of the energy transition that we need both from an economic point of view and a climate point of view.”
There’s little to contest the fact that Tesla is already successful. The Model Y was the world’s best-selling car in 2023, eclipsing the Toyota Corolla, a historical bestseller. Tesla’s market valuation, hovering around some $544 billion at the time of publication, is viewed more as a technology company rather than a car company.
But its stock has been volatile, sales are tumbling and Musk frequently engages in political and culture wars online. Combine all of this with a lack of succession plans and an executive bench that's now far less deep than it was at the end of last year, and there’s a big question mark over the company’s future.
“When that same CEO is distracted by work at many other companies and other communications and political activities that bring discord, even amongst your own customer base, that's not a good recipe for the long-term thriving of the company,” Lander said.
Lander’s letter correctly points out that one of the reasons for approving such a substantial pay package in 2018 was to retain Musk and ensure his focus on Tesla’s success for a ten-year term. However, this has not been the case, as his other business commitments have only expanded during that time.
Meanwhile, Tesla is going all guns blazing to persuade investors to approve Musk’s massive pay package. Apart from aggressive ads and social media campaigns, it has even hired a “strategic advisor” to help with the task at hand.
All said, the outcome of the June 13 shareholder vote will be pivotal. Whether investors will prioritize Musk’s vision for AI and robotics or heed the call for stronger governance and a return to core EV manufacturing remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the stakes for Tesla’s future have never been higher.

The Kia EV3 Won’t Replace The Niro EV,https://insideevs.com/news/720576/kia-ev3-not-replacing-niro-ev/,"Although the Niro is slightly larger than the EV3, it has a smaller battery than the newly introduced subcompact crossover.",5/23/2024 8:37,"With the international launch of the all-new Kia EV3 subcompact electric crossover, the South Korean automaker is aiming for a new slice of the market–that of the affordable EV.
But Kia already has the Niro EV in that segment, with the souped-up hatchback having secured its place on the “most affordable new EVs on the market” lists over the years. So what will happen now that two models from the same manufacturer will compete for the same loaf of bread? In short, nothing, as Kia explained during its tech talk before the official reveal of the EV3.
New EV3 or older Niro EV?
The all-new Kia EV3 is the South Korean automaker's smallest model based on its modular E-GMP platform. As a result, it boasts all the latest tech that can be crammed into an entry-level model, including all the possible efficiency improvements. By contrast, the older Niro EV, which is just a few inches longer than the EV3, is still going strong on Kia's old combustion platform that was adapted for plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains.
The South Korean automaker said there will be a place for both the Niro and EV3 because customers who choose the Niro typically go for the hybrid instead of the all-electric version, paving the way for the EV3 to get a bigger cut.
More Kia Stories
“We will continue to sell Niro EV together with the EV3 because each market has different tastes or customer preferences,” said Spencer Chou, Head of Kia’s Global Business Planning. “In the meantime, the Niro has a hybrid model and we expect that [customers] will choose the Niro hybrid model rather than EV.”
In other words, Kia expects hardcore EV enthusiasts to buy the new EV3 when it arrives in the United States later this year, while the Niro hybrid will continue to target customers who prefer the safety net of a gas tank.
Kia EV3 subcompact electric crossover
2024 Kia Niro EV compact crossover
However, that begs the question: why keep the Niro EV in the lineup? Kia has never disclosed sales of both the electrified and all-electric Niro in the U.S. in its reports, so it’s hard to gauge how many units have been shifted. One report from last year claimed that the fully electric Niro has amassed a little over 200,000 sales globally since its introduction in 2018. Still, no details about U.S. sales of the fully electric version were offered. Nor have any sales figures been provided for the hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions.
Size-wise, the current Niro EV is roughly 5 inches longer and has a wheelbase that’s bigger by almost 2 inches compared to the EV3. The Niro is also 1 inch narrower and has a battery capacity of 64.8 kilowatt-hours, whereas the shiny new EV3 boasts an 81.4-kWh pack, although we assume that this figure is for the long-range version and that a smaller pack will also be offered.
In the pricing department, the Niro EV starts at $40,925 (including $1,325 destination), while the Niro Plug-In Hybrid has a base MSRP of $35,715. The cheapest electrified Niro, the hybrid, is even more affordable, starting at $28,265.
Meanwhile, the EV3 is expected to carry a price tag of around $35,000 to $45,000, making it slightly more affordable than the Niro EV. However, this pricing strategy is not official yet, so we’ll have to wait and see how Kia positions its new entry-level electric crossover.
Until that happens, let us know in the comments below which you would choose: EV3 or Niro EV.",Iulian Dnistran
Forget Chinese EVs. Biden’s Tariffs Will Hit The Cheapest Tesla Model 3.,https://insideevs.com/news/720126/tesla-model-3-tariff-batteries/,"A higher tariff on EV battery imports will make Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3 RWD, more expensive to produce. Other EVs may be affected too.",5/17/2024 15:31,"Of all the hefty tariffs against Chinese goods that President Joe Biden’s administration announced this week, the 100% tax on electric vehicles has gotten the most buzz. That the White House felt the need to effectively double the price of any Chinese EV coming to U.S. shores underscores just how vulnerable the world’s automakers are right now.
But other parts of Biden’s anti-China trade agenda will have a more significant and immediate impact on the U.S. EV landscape. Case in point: A higher tariff on EV battery imports will make Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3 RWD, more expensive to produce.
Biden's tariffs hit back hard at China
New 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs are meant to protect automakers operating in the U.S. from being undercut by competition whose prices they can't match. But they could also make EVs that use Chinese batteries much more expensive.
Tesla makes the U.S.-spec $38,990 Model 3 RWD in California using battery cells from CATL, one of China’s biggest producers of EV batteries. Biden’s new tariffs will raise the tax on imported Chinese EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%.
Tesla will need to either eat the higher costs, find a new battery supplier or deprioritize the entry-level Model 3, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. But he said consumers are unlikely to feel the pain of these higher costs in an era of slackening EV demand. Manufacturers are having trouble selling EVs at their current prices, so price hikes aren’t a winning strategy, he said.
“They need to get these vehicles sold,” Fiorani said. “And until a balance is made between supply and demand, there's very little upward pressure on pricing.”
Aside from the Polestar 2 and the upcoming Volvo EX30, there are no Chinese-made electric cars for sale in the U.S. So quadrupling the existing tariff on them is a largely symbolic move, some experts say. It may be more about shoring up the Democratic vote in manufacturing hubs like Michigan and Ohio than it is about Chinese cars, although the U.S. government would dispute that. Still, some EVs with China-sourced batteries or battery components could get hit here as well, whenever these price increases actually go into effect.
Thanks to lavish government subsidies for the EV industry and years of intense R&D and internal competition, China has become a battery-manufacturing titan. It’s also a global leader in the refining of raw materials like lithium and graphite, which are critical to batteries. It’s particularly dominant in the production of EV batteries that use a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry. Those batteries offer less range and slower charging speeds than cells with other makeups, but are cheaper. They’re widely seen as key to bringing down the cost of electric cars, which remain more expensive than conventional cars in the U.S. Tesla uses LFP batteries in the Model 3 RWD.
“It's safe to say there's no EV being put on the market anywhere in the world that isn't dependent in some way on materials processing and manufacturing that's taking place in China,” said Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College and the author of Charged: A History of Batteries and Lessons for a Clean Energy Future.
The Biden Administration has made it a priority to build up domestic battery manufacturing and disentangle the U.S. auto sector from Chinese supply chains. Hence the beefed-up 25% tariffs on Chinese batteries and critical minerals announced on Tuesday. Additionally, the longstanding $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases was revamped through the Inflation Reduction Act and now only applies to cars made in North America without any Chinese battery components. When that provision kicked in in January, the Model 3 RWD was booted from eligibility, along with some other vehicles.
It’s not immediately clear if any other U.S.-made EVs would be vulnerable to battery tariffs like the Model 3 RWD is. It may be the only one. The Model 3 Long Range has significant Chinese content (40% of its value, according to U.S. government records) and doesn’t qualify for the EV tax credit. However, the independent Tesla researcher Troy Teslike tells InsideEVs that its batteries are made in South Korea with Chinese components.
Ford has said that it would introduce LFP batteries to the F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but those don't seem to be in production yet. The truck is still eligible for the full EV tax credit, indicating it doesn’t contain Chinese battery components. Ford plans to start domestic production of LFP batteries (using licensed CATL technology) by 2026. Until then, it would have to source them from China. Ford didn’t respond to questions about all of this.
(Update Saturday, May 18: After publication, a Ford spokesperson confirmed the company has since canceled plans for an LFP-powered F-150 Lightning. ""We continue to look at multiple chemistries for the long-term. We remain committed to LFP however we no longer plan to introduce LFP on Lightning due to previously announced updates to our production plans."")
There are some other U.S.-market EVs that contain Chinese batteries, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the all-wheel-drive variant of the Toyota bZ4X. But since those vehicles are assembled in Mexico and Japan, respectively, they aren’t subjected to the tariffs, a U.S. Office of the Trade Representative official told InsideEVs. (In other words, if a Chinese battery pack is already in a car when it arrives in the U.S., it’s not taxed independently of that vehicle.) The U.S. is looking closely at those kinds of vehicles, as well as the potential for Chinese companies to circumvent the tariffs by setting up factories in Mexico, the official said.
The taxes on batteries and minerals may be more consequential than the Chinese car tariff in the short term. Still, experts polled by InsideEVs did not believe that the tariffs on batteries and minerals would have a lasting impact on the prices EV buyers see.
Any automaker selling EVs in the U.S. is likely working to make its cars eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports. That would involve backing away from Chinese content anyway, regardless of any tariffs.
Batteries and raw materials may become more expensive for U.S. battery and car manufacturers, said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, an EV advocacy group. But that would only result in short-term price increases for cars, she said.
“We expect to see prices stabilize as the domestic supply chain is built out,” Malmgren said.

Polestar Depends On China For Now. It Wants 'More Clarity' On What EV Tariffs Mean,https://insideevs.com/news/720054/polestar-clarity-us-tariffs-says/,"The brand is ""currently evaluating"" 100% EV tariff increases from the Biden Administration, including the impact on Polestar 2 prices.",5/17/2024 9:35,"President Joe Biden’s announcement of new 100% tariffs that target potential Chinese EV imports and battery production has made ripples internationally. In theory, the tariffs are meant to fend off an impending swarm of EV imports from China and stop the country from completely dominating the EV battery supply chain. Yet, they could have some unintended consequences for brands that already exist in the United States.
While in Madrid for the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 international launch, Biden officially brought the hammer down on the tariff right in the middle of the Sino-Swedish brand’s most important debut of its future models.
Polestar Is Intertwined with Geely
Recently, Polestar became even more intertwined with Chinese automaker Geely. As of February 2024, the Geely owns 72% of Polestar. The remaining 18% is controlled by Volvo.
I had a quick conversation with CEO Thomas Ingenlath to find out just how the brand plans to deal with this, but things aren’t exactly clear for anyone right now.
“All effects that come now, we have to analyze and see what works, and what doesn’t work,"" Ingenlath said. ""We need more clarity, and ultimately we [need to know] what are actually the rules.""
Indeed, the entire auto industry seems totally caught off guard by the tariff announcement. At an event in Detroit this week, General Motors President Mark Reuss said the automaker was also still studying the immediate effects of the new rules, including their potential impact on future battery partnerships.
Right now, Polestar in particular feels fairly vulnerable to all sides of the tariff. True, some of the brand’s efforts are less impacted than others; when the Polestar 3 enters production it will be built in South Carolina, so it won't feel those effects.
Similarly, the U.S. versions of the Polestar 4 won’t come from the Hangzhou, China plant, but actually, a new plant in South Korea (formerly a Renault-Samsung factory) that should be operational before the end of the year.
But that doesn’t mean Polestar is out of the woods yet.
Both the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 use batteries made by Chinese battery provider CATL. Import tariffs on those batteries went from 7.5% to 25%, potentially adding thousands of dollars to the vehicle’s build cost.
Even worse off is the Polestar 2 sedan. All of them are made in China, meaning it is now subject to an import tariff that is now four times as high as it was before. When directly asked if pricing would change on the Polestar 3 and 4 after the tariffs, Polestar’s representatives said the brand had no plans on altering things from what was announced a few weeks ago.
So as far as we know, the Polestar 4 will continue to start at $54,300 before destination fees, and the Polestar 3’s pre-destination fee price of $73,400 will continue to hold true for the foreseeable future.
There’s no word on how long the brand will take it on the chin for the Polestar 2, though. Given the company’s not-so-strong stock price and slow sales performance, it is really in a vulnerable place here. It’s volume-selling, the entry-level model is now shaping up to be a catastrophic money loser.
In a similar vein, while I was in China, Geely’s Vice President Ruiping Wang said that one of her biggest goals is to continue to streamline the brands Geely has control over, through the use of more shared parts, streamlined development, and common platforms.
When asked, Ingenlath said this was a positive move, and said that Polestar’s continued access to the Geely toolbox would be an asset for the company.
However, given that Geely’s toolbox means that Polestar would be pulling more from China-made and China-designed assets, how exactly would Polestar outmaneuver the ire of the tariffs that could come with using more Geely parts? It’s not at all clear, there are no perfect clean solutions yet.
Still, Polestar officials remains seemingly optimistic, even if they're wagging a finger at the Biden Administration’s decision.
“As a global company headquartered in Sweden, listed on NASDAQ in New York, and operating across 27 markets, we believe that free trade is essential to speed up the transition to more sustainable mobility through increased EV adoption,"" a company spokesperson said via email. ""Production of Polestar 3 is set to begin in South Carolina in the summer, diversifying our manufacturing footprint and supporting job creation and economic growth in the region. This important SUV for us will be built in the USA for U.S. and Canadian customers as well as for export to European markets.""
We won’t know exactly how these tariffs will shake out, until they shake out.

"As It Launches An Affordable EV, General Motors Wants 'A Level Playing Field' With China",https://insideevs.com/news/719750/gm-electric-china-tariffs/,"GM President Mark Reuss weighs in on Biden's tariffs on China, the Equinox EV, hybrids and more.",5/15/2024 18:39,"Even the executives at General Motors will admit that when it comes to the electric vehicle arms race, Chevrolet hasn't really been in the game.
Its top-selling EV last year, the Chevrolet Bolt, carried the bulk of the entire company's all-electric sales despite being largely unprofitable and discontinued in December. Meanwhile, more modern EVs on GM's new Ultium platform faced quality issues, delays getting to market and repeated customer disappointments.
GM gets real with EVs in 2024
GM officials have said the bulk of the software and battery issues that plagued its EV lineup in 2023 are behind them. But now, it's bringing new EVs to market at a time when sales aren't as red-hot as they once were. Will new tariffs at least eliminate the immediate threat of Chinese EVs?
That's all supposed to change soon as GM launches its first affordable modern EV, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which offers up to 319 miles of range and should cost around $35,000 after tax credits. Then an even more affordable LT variant will debut later this year that should push the price tag into the high-$20,000 range after tax credits.
With demand for affordable EVs at its highest-ever level, GM expects the Equinox EV to be a hit. And at least for now, it won't have to compete against the threat of a flood of cheaper competitors from China, thanks to the Biden Administration's recently announced 100% tariffs on EVs from that country.
""We just want a level playing field,"" GM President Mark Reuss told InsideEVs at the Equinox EV's launch event near Detroit this week. He said the fear is that competitors from China could come into the U.S. market not to seek profits necessarily, but to kneecap the local market.
""There are strategies where folks will get into a price war and not make money, but try to price things out of markets,"" Reuss said. ""It's not even [China's] supply chain, it's their pricing strategy. We just want a level playing field to be able to price and make a profit and deliver value to our customers.""
The Biden Administration's new tariffs quadruple those already in effect on Chinese vehicles and are designed to assuage fears that the country's rising automakers could arrive in the U.S. with vastly lower prices than car companies here are prepared to deal with. A similar situation is happening right now in Europe, where local stalwarts like Volkswagen are quickly losing ground to new competition from China. In response, the European Union is examining similar penalties against Chinese EVs.
At the same time, critics have said that without the threat of competition from China's auto industry—which accelerated rapidly amid copious government subsidies and a laser focus on battery technology and software—automakers that operate in America could be given license to slow-walk the electric transition. Or worse, abandon it entirely.
GM too has been accused of walking back some of its promises on that front. The leadership of its luxury division Cadillac recently said the brand will make internal combustion cars past the previously stated end date of 2030. And at the launch of the Equinox EV this week, GM officials have stressed the need to ""let customers make the choice"" while it has ""feet in both camps."" Indeed, recent social media posts have led at least some followers to question GM's overall commitment to EVs.
Still, GM is moving ahead on several all-electric models this year, including the Equinox EV, Silverado EV and Cadillac Optiq. The automaker is also rolling out more home energy solutions, including battery storage and equipment that allows cars like the Silverado EV to power entire homes.
""We're playing in the heart of the market,"" Reuss said of the Equinox EV. ""For me, it's really, really important to get a vehicle at that price point into the hands of everybody, and it just hasn't quite been done yet.""
Reuss declined to elaborate on whether he saw GM competing with an automaker like BYD in the immediate term. ""We already do in China,"" he said. ""Here in Michigan, I don't know. But we aren't going to price our way out of business to win. What we are going to do is offer great vehicles, a brand experience and a customer experience that's hard to match.""
With the ink on Biden's tariff announcement barely dry, Reuss said he was unsure of the potential impact on who GM might partner with for less expensive lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries or on potential retaliatory tariffs from China itself. There, GM has a fine line to walk; though its market share in China has declined in recent years, the country remains an incredibly important source of sales and revenue.
Meanwhile, GM recently reversed course on a decision not to develop and sell hybrid cars, particularly after their surprise success in 2023 with buyers not ready to go fully electric. GM sells a number of plug-in hybrid models in China right now.
Reuss said similar technology could be deployed on U.S. market cars, but those cars won't be imported from China.
""That's our tech,"" he said. ""We know how to do it, and we're going to do a few. I can't tell you what yet, but [they] wouldn't be imported.""

"Mercedes-Benz Cancels Next-Gen Platform For EQS, EQE EVs: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/719738/mercedes-benz-cancels-next-large-ev-platform-eqs-eqe-report/,Poor sales of the current generation of top-spec EVs prompted the German automaker to cut back on investments.,5/15/2024 10:30,"Mercedes-Benz has reportedly canceled the next-generation platform designed specifically for the successors of the EQS and EQE due to the poor sales of the current-gen models, German publication Handelsblatt reported, quoted by Autocar.
The new platform, dubbed MB.EA Large, was supposed to be launched in 2028. Its cancelation will save Mercedes-Benz an estimated $4.3 billion to $6.5 billion in development and retooling costs, according to four insiders with knowledge of the matter.
Mercedes-Benz tracks back on EV investments
After delaying its goal of having a 50% sales share of electrified vehicles from 2025 to 2030 and rolling back the introduction of an all-electric portfolio by 2030 ""in markets where the conditions allow,"" Mercedes-Benz has reportedly canceled the all-new platform that was supposed to underpin the next generations of the EQE and EQS sedans.
Last year, Mercedes-Benz sold a total of 43,202 EVs in the United States, a healthy increase of 248% compared to 2022. However, the number is far from impressive. Rivian, which is still very much a startup, beat the Germans by delivering a little over 50,000 EVs last year (this includes the commercial vehicle segment).
More Mercedes-Benz EV Stories
Furthermore, the first quarter of this year brought a 4.5% decline in U.S.-market sales for Mercedes-Benz compared to the same period last year, resulting in only 8,336 units.
The MB.EA Large platform was one of two MB.EA platforms, the other one being MB.EA Medium, which is still in development and will be used for the next-gen EQC sedan and SUV. Or C-Class with EQ Technology, as the company recently changed its naming structure for battery-powered cars.
That said, the successors of the current EQS and EQE EVs, including sedans and SUVs, are still very much on the table, albeit on an upgraded version of the EVA2 platform that’s currently being used for the company’s flagship EVs.
According to Autocar, the 400-volt charging architecture will be upgraded to an 800V system on the upcoming EQE and EQS. The battery cells will also offer more energy compared to the current models, and the electric motors will be swapped for more efficient units.
Other Mercedes-Benz platforms that are still in development include the MMA platform, designed for both electric and combustion compact models like the CLA, GLA and GLB, MB.AMG for sports cars and MB.Van for commercial vehicles.
The latest change in the German company’s electric vehicle plans comes after postponing its target of achieving a 50% share of electrified cars from 2025 and 2030. Mercedes-Benz also rolled back plans to sell only EVs by 2030 in certain markets.",Iulian Dnistran

Among this global talent pool, many are interns. Just as they began what they thought was a promising opportunity in a burgeoning electric vehicle industry, they were dismissed. Now, General Motors hopes to seize the opportunity by nurturing them under its umbrella.
Former Apple Recruiting Manager and GM's current Talent Sourcing Strategist Laura Del Amo posted on LinkedIn that the Detroit automaker was keen to provide laid-off Tesla interns an opportunity within GM’s software teams. The post was spotted and first reported by Business Insider.
Tesla's biggest-ever layoffs.
After years of rapid growth, Tesla has hit a roadblock. Its Q1 2024 sales were down, messaging around the future affordable EV is muddled, and some 20,000 Tesla employees worldwide have lost their jobs. Some of the laid-off staff now might find roles at rival brands.
“In light of recent industry news, GM is extending an invite to software students who may have been impacted from the changes in Tesla’s upcoming summer internship cohort,” Del Amo wrote on the social media platform. “We believe in the strength of our automotive community and are keen to integrate diverse talents into our team. If you are now looking for a new internship opportunity, let's connect,” she added.
Del Amo did not respond to a DM on LinkedIn and GM did not reply to InsideEVs request for comment at the time of publication. We will update this post if we hear back.
Since the post went live Monday, dozens of fresh software grads have expressed interest in the comments. These include several master’s and PhD students specializing in computer science, computer engineering, data analytics and other related fields.
Hiring former Tesla interns might be a new thing. But GM has a history of hiring former Tesla executives. Kurt Kelty, who previously served as Tesla's senior director of battery technology, has taken on the role of vice president of battery operations at GM. Additionally, the company recently appointed Jens Peter Clausen as its new head of manufacturing. Clausen is the former vice president of Gigafactory Nevada.
Internship program aside, several other departments at Tesla have been rattled by the recent layoffs. That includes engineering, production, marketing, design and human resources among others. More importantly, the dismissal of Tesla’s entire Supercharger team sent shockwaves across the industry last week. It was the same team that helped build America’s most comprehensive and reliable charging network, driving sales of EVs.

Republican Bill To End EV Tax Credits Gets Almost No Support From Carmaking States,https://insideevs.com/news/718806/gop-tax-credit-bill-wyoming/,A new Senate bill would end the federal EV tax credit. Not signing on: states that actually manufacture cars.,5/7/2024 12:00,"It's truly a shame that electric vehicles are getting caught up in our endless culture wars, because they don't have to be. EVs represent a new type of technology, that's all. But thanks to their outsize popularity in coastal blue states and federal tax incentives introduced to support their adoption, they've become extremely polarizing in America. Now, a new U.S. Senate bill seeks to end those tax credits entirely.
The bill has support from several GOP colleagues of the original sponsor, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming. Not joining in support of Barasso's bill: any states that actually manufacture electric cars. I wonder why that is?
The EV tax credit war
Tax credits have long been used to incentivize the purchase of hybrid and electric vehicles, both in the U.S. and abroad. But that often makes them a political target, even though in recent years they are helping to drive more local EV manufacturing as well.
Barasso's bill, called the Eliminating Lavish Incentives to Electric (ELITE) Vehicles Act, would eviscerate every American incentive driving EV adoption over the past 18 months. It would repeal the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, end federal incentives for DC fast chargers, end any tax credits for used EVs and close the ""leasing loophole"" that applies to that tax credit even if the car is not manufactured in North America. That loophole has driven significant EV leasing growth, including from brands like Hyundai and Kia.
“The electric vehicle tax credit benefits the wealthiest of Americans and costs hardworking American taxpayers billions of dollars,” Barrasso said in a statement. “Working families in Wyoming shouldn’t be footing the bill for the luxuries of Biden’s climate elitists. The federal government has no business pushing Americans into expensive electric cars they don’t want or can’t afford.""
Put aside, for a moment, the idea that these tax credits do make EVs more affordable and may make people want to buy them more—which has clearly been the case. Instead, let's take a look at who is co-sponsoring Barasso's bill:
Co-sponsors of this legislation include U.S. Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Steve Daines, (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and John Thune (R-S.D.).
Besides all of them being members of Biden's opposition party, you may notice that none of those states are hosts to any electric vehicle manufacturing. In fact, with the sole exception of Missouri, Kansas, and Indiana, none of the co-sponsor states even make cars at all.
Granted, some of those states are home to various supplier companies or even engine manufacturing plants. But no cars, period, are built in Wyoming. Or Arkansas. Or Montana. Or Florida. Or South Dakota. You get the idea.
Note that the bill's co-sponsors don't include any senators from Texas, where Tesla's Austin Gigafactory lives; or Tennessee, home to Volkswagen's ID.4 (and soon, Nissan EVs as well); or South Carolina, home to BMW in the U.S.; or Alabama, where Mercedes' electric SUVs are built. And all of those are conservative, red states with Republican senators.
That's the problem with Barrasso's bill: it fails to take into account how the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits actually incentivize EV production in the U.S. and North America. After all, if automakers don't build here, they won't get the tax credit—which puts them at a competitive disadvantage against those that do. It's no wonder that leaders from automaking states don't want EV tax credits to end; the EV industry is adding hundreds of thousands of new American manufacturing jobs that depend on people actually buying the cars.
Moreover, Barrasso and several of his co-sponsor colleagues go heavy on the anti-China fearmongering, saying the tax credits are funneling money to a geopolitical adversary. But while it's true that China maintains tight control over the battery supply chain for now, that's changing rapidly as companies scale up North American battery manufacturing and sourcing operations—again, to feed demand for locally built EVs.
Barrasso's bill is extremely unlikely to pass, let alone get to President Joe Biden's desk. But looking into who sponsors it and who doesn't gives you a good sense of just how serious it's supposed to be.

"Even More Tesla Layoffs Are Underway; Design, Engineering, HR Impacted",https://insideevs.com/news/718636/even-more-tesla-layoffs-may/,The automaker is still on the chopping block and it’s unclear when these layoffs will end.,5/6/2024 11:48,"It’s not over yet. After a tumultuous week marred by hundreds of dismissals within Tesla’s Supercharger team—the same team that helped build North America’s largest and most reliable charging network—it seems like that the automaker's relentless layoffs are continuing into this week.
During the weekend, several Tesla employees appeared to have been laid off, as reported by workers on LinkedIn and various social media platforms. Employees from design and engineering teams, product managers, and human resources, among others, shared on social media that they received notifications of the layoffs via email over the weekend, with many being informed on Sunday.

The now-former employees also shared screenshots of the emails they received from Tesla, revealing the sudden nature of these layoffs. They were terminated with immediate effect, losing access to Tesla systems and physical facilities on the same day they received the emails. Some of these individuals are still awaiting details regarding severance packages, continuation of benefits, and separation documents.
In April, Tesla announced that it would lay off ""more than 10%"" of its global workforce. Concurrently, several high-ranking executives departed from the company. Just a week later, The Information revealed that the company planned to dismiss nearly its entire Supercharger team—the very team instrumental in establishing the gold standard for charging infrastructure in North America.
The layoffs follow the company's growing focus on robotaxis and artificial intelligence. Workers interviewed by InsideEVs expressed concerns that the Supercharger layoffs, in particular, could impact the quality and reliability of the network—a network relied upon by millions of Tesla users and soon to be accessible to EV owners from other brands as well.

"American Culture Wars, Chinese Imports: Why Australia's EV Market Is So Fascinating",https://insideevs.com/news/718504/australia-ev-market-overview-2024/,"Electric utes when, though?",5/5/2024 13:00,"Australia isn't one of the biggest markets in the world for electric vehicles, but it is one of the most interesting. With a small population, long-standing love of petrol-guzzling highway cruisers and close proximity to China, it's a nation that in some ways lags behind the rest of the world in EV adoption, and in other ways… also lags. But it's trying its best.
Like a lot of other things about the country, the Australian EV market is a melting pot, featuring cars and trends you’d recognize from all over the world—from American-style culture wars to discount Chinese imports—thrown together in the most chaotic way possible, with governments scrambling to adapt to changes in the market and buyers reluctant to trade in their big dual cab utes.
The electric vehicle market in Australia is booming. Well, kind of. Electric car sales saw a 161% increase in 2023 compared to 2022’s numbers, which taken as a percentage alone is a huge leap. In terms of the actual number of cars finding new homes, it constituted a jump from 33,000 EVs sold in 2022 to 87,000 in 2023, which are small numbers no matter the market (especially when you consider over 1.2 million cars were sold in Australia in total last year). To paint a bigger picture, despite these recent upswings in sales, electric cars currently make up just 1% of the total passenger fleet in Australia.
Still, a leap is a leap (8% of all car sales in 2023 were EVs, up to 10% in early 2024, which is progress—and higher than the U.S. already), and it’s a sign that after years of pricing buyers out of the market, thanks in part to a restrictive luxury vehicle tax that unfairly targeted the high battery costs of an EV, some recent tax concessions, combined with more affordable models making their way to showrooms, are finally convincing more and more Aussies to make the switch to electric cars.
Tesla’s brand awareness has also played a part here but other manufacturers—Kia, Hyundai, BYD, MG, BMW, Volvo and Polestar—are making strides as well. After years of supply woes during the pandemic, where Australia was a low priority for many companies, rival cars are now arriving in volume, and with enough variety that consumers now have a genuine choice, across manufacturers and categories, when it comes to buying an EV.
Early estimates show that EV sales in Australia for 2024 should comfortably pass the 100,000 mark, which would be another huge increase from 2023. The continued popularity of home solar installations is also helping here, as is a slow-burning change in public opinion, which put electric cars on the frontlines of the culture wars in 2019 when then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the opposition Labor Party’s attempts at formulating an EV policy for the ICE-dominated market–which he incorrectly believed would replace Australia’s beloved dual cab utes and SUVs with much smaller vehicles unable to “tow your trailer” or “get you out to your favorite camping spot with your family”—an attempt to “end the weekend,"" as they said.
But significant challenges remain if mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is to come anywhere near the targets some governments are setting, like the Australian Capital Territory’s goal of phasing out all consumer internal combustion car sales by 2035, which is a much stricter objective than the Biden administration’s call for EV sales to make up 50% of the American market by 2030.
The single biggest issue facing the Australian EV market, more than any hesitation over price or cultural opposition, is infrastructure. Specifically, the lack of it. There simply aren’t enough public (or private) charging stations to facilitate the widescale adoption of electric cars, there aren’t enough being built, and the chargers Australia does have are often too slow, unreliable or both.
This affects all Australians, regardless of where or how they live. For an increasing number of inner-city apartment dwellers, where building owners are reluctant (despite some recent government attempts) to invest in chargers, tenants are being locked out of one of the great financial incentives of owning an EV: saving money on fuel. For regional Australians–or anyone traveling regionally, something we’ll get to soon–a scarcity of highway chargers makes traveling long distances between towns a perilous prospect.
And for suburban homeowners, well… actually, they’re doing just fine. Indeed contrary to a lot of stereotypes about electric car owners in Australia—that they’re usually confined to the wealthy inner suburbs of our biggest cities—the biggest contributors to EV growth in the country are actually suburbanites, who are taking advantage of home solar to slash the costs of their daily commute.
Charging also affects many Australians (or at least many Australians yet to purchase an EV) on a psychological basis, with continued concerns over range and charging times on long road trips. Like the US, Australia is a large, car-dependent nation, where people regularly travel huge distances for work, holidays and visiting family.
Anyone making these trips in an ICE vehicle wouldn’t think twice about range, because there are petrol stations all across the nation’s highways and towns. But highway charging stations here are still few and far between, many are slow (50kwh and under), and the newer stations that are operational are often plagued with reliability issues and long queues on popular travel dates. (Again, sound familiar?)
It’s one thing telling prospective EV owners that their regular interstate drives might take 20-30 minutes longer while they wait for a charge. It’s another to tell them there might be lines keeping them there for an hour or more during holidays (when they’re most likely to be traveling!), and that’s if the machines are even working in the first place.
This is less of a concern for Tesla owners, of course, because like in many other markets the company has scores of proprietary charging stations all across Australia. And last year Tesla began the process of opening some of these up to owners of non-Tesla vehicles, albeit at a premium price. (Nearly all electric vehicles in Australia, Tesla or otherwise, employ a standard CCS2 port, making this cooperation much easier than somewhere like the US where an adapter is currently required.)
But Australia can’t rely on Tesla chargers alone to pick up the slack; if governments are truly interested in seeing more and more people make the switch to an electric vehicle, there needs to be a greater commitment to providing the infrastructure—whether through incentives or direct management of the rollout–that switch requires.
In the least surprising news possible, it’s Tesla that dominates the Australian EV market. As the first EV company to take Australia seriously, and the first to really establish a presence here–both with showrooms and charging stations–it’s been able to build up a market lead that dwarfs that of its competitors.
Tesla sold over 45,000 cars in Australia last year, with sales of just two models (the Model Y and Model 3) accounting for 53% of all electric car sales in the country. That’s a colossal presence in a fledgling market, but it actually constitutes a slide from 58% of all EV sales in 2022, as more and more companies enter the market at scale and chip away at Tesla’s total share.
Outside of Tesla, some of the more traditional manufacturers enjoying sales success in Australia in 2023 included Kia with the EV6, Volvo with both the XC40 Recharge and C40, and Mercedes-Benz with the EQA. The Polestar 2 (disclaimer, I own one) also sold in (relatively) healthy numbers.
The biggest splash in the Australian market last year, though, was made by discount (at least by EV standards) Chinese companies, particularly BYD and MG, who count Australia as one of their few (current) Western markets thanks to a lack of heavy tariffs like those imposed by the U.S. Despite the low-rent branding–which has led to corporate intervention—Australian buyers fell in love with the low-cost BYD Atto 3, which ended 2023 as the country’s third biggest-selling EV. Right behind it was MG’s MG4, which finished fourth despite only going on sale halfway through the year.
New vehicles from BYD like the Seal (March 2024’s fourth best-selling EV) and Dolphin (in sixth place) should further cement the company’s presence in Australia. And as Kia, Hyundai, Polestar, Volvo, BMW (and more) ramp up their own product offerings, and Volkswagen belatedly brings the ID range down under, Australians are increasingly getting the opportunity to really shop around for an EV.
While I’ve already listed a number of infrastructure and pricing roadblocks to EV adoption, there are also some cultural barriers to overcome. Australia is, after all, a nation whose automotive heritage is inexorably linked with the big petrol engines of the Ford v Holden era.
While those days are all but over, as it’s been almost a decade since the end of local manufacturing of the Commodore and Falcon, Australia is still a country obsessed with petrol-guzzling family cars. We’ve just replaced the sedans of old with the giant pickups of the 21st century.
Australia’s three top-selling cars for 2023 were all big utes. The Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux and Isuzu D-Max sold 155,000 cars combined, which constituted 12.7% of the total Australian car market. And while it’s a lazy stereotype to suggest these are also the same buyers who would scoff at the very idea of driving an electric car, there’s a practical side to these sales numbers: the Australian workers and families buying these big cars don’t have much choice in the market, whether they want an EV equivalent or not, because there simply aren’t any electrified versions of those best-sellers available.
Toyota EPU Pickup Truck Concept
Rivian doesn’t sell cars in Australia, there’s no sign of Ford’s F-150 Lightning, BYD’s pickup is still TBD and while Toyota has unveiled an electrified ute concept, and Isuzu an electric D-Max, it could be years until they hit the market.
While Australia’s road to EV adoption has been a rocky one so far, there’s a chance at a brighter future ahead, provided governments can take necessary action that goes beyond individual states offering (and in some cases now pulling) inconsistent purchasing incentives.
Manufacturers are doing what they can, as electric cars arrive in greater numbers and more affordable pricing than ever before, but until buyers are confident that there’s a robust infrastructure around the nation to support them wherever they’re used to driving—and electric versions of the types of cars most popular in the local market become available—many Aussies will remain understandably reluctant to make the switch.

Now he's out.,5/2/2024 11:10,"Tesla is on a mass layoff rampage. The company not only announced a global workforce reduction of 10% last month but followed that up by dismissing almost its entire Supercharging team—the same team that laid the groundwork for Tesla’s success and established what is today the gold standard of EV charging in the U.S. and several other nations.

Clad in a white Tesla-branded cap and a gray Nike t-shirt and sitting in his Model Y, Nico Murillo recalled his experience. The 29-year-old had been working at Tesla for five years. He started as a Production Associate in 2019 and was promoted to a Lead Production Associate and then a Production Supervisor.
At 4:30 a.m. on April 15, Murillo said he opened his laptop to a deactivated account. He thought it was an IT problem and got ready for work anyway. He then started his 90-minute commute to work, during which he usually checked his emails and listened to podcasts. He said he was able to check emails thanks to the Model Y’s Autopilot. (Note: This is not advisable; Autopilot and Full-Self Driving are driver assistance systems that require constant supervision and readiness to take control at all times.)
As he sifted through emails, he came across a message from Tesla, which read: ""Unfortunately as a result, your position has been eliminated by this restructuring."" His manager confirmed the same for him. He reached the factory at 5:50 a.m. and tried to badge in. That’s when a security guard walked up to him, told him he was part of the layoffs and took his badge away. “I sat in my car in disbelief,” Murillo said.
Murillo seems to have sacrificed a lot for Tesla. Because the commute from home was so long, he sometimes slept in his Model Y on workdays in the factory lot. The demanding 13-hour shifts left him with little energy to return home, leading him to camp in his car, shower at the factory and microwave dinner in the break room. Now he’s out.
What’s next for him? He says the cost of living in California is exorbitant, which is why he will sell his house and furniture and begin living in his car. The video above is worth watching in full because it captures the essence and impact of Tesla’s layoffs and how they have uprooted the lives of so many employees.

Tesla Axing Its Supercharger Team Puts The Entire Industry In The Dark,https://insideevs.com/news/718025/tesla-charging-layoffs-2024/,"Most of Tesla's Supercharger team was caught up in recent layoffs, leading to countless questions about the future of EV charging.",4/30/2024 13:13,"Even if you're a die-hard, paying-blue-check, all-in-on-$TSLA, Elon-can-do-no-wrong superfan, it's awfully hard to find a silver lining around the news that most—if not all—of Tesla's Supercharging team was caught up in the company's latest round of layoffs.
Last night, The Information reported that roughly 500 people in Tesla's charging division are being cut from the company, including its senior director and head of new products. A quick perusal of LinkedIn, Reddit, X and other social media platforms shows scores of people who worked on the charging team at Tesla announcing their layoffs. All of them seem utterly (and understandably) stunned that they had to. (Emails and direct messages to several current and former Tesla officials have gone unanswered.)
Get in touch.

Moreover, Musk's own memo to the troops doesn't provide much information or reassurance about the future of charging. “We will continue to build out some new Supercharger locations, where critical, and finish those currently under construction,” Musk wrote, almost with the same level of interest as when he spoke of future Tesla models during last week's Q1 earnings call.
Astoundingly, the rest of the auto industry that was getting ready to partner with Tesla on charging seems blindsided as well today, leaving them with countless questions about what's next. ""We were surprised as anyone, and have no additional information than what’s been reported,"" one automaker official told me.
There's no two ways about it: this move is utterly baffling. And to one degree or another, it may throw a lot of future plans for both Tesla and the American EV industry into turmoil.
In recent months and weeks, we've seen Musk seemingly lose interest in Tesla's position as the singular leader (Chinese automakers excepted) in the electric vehicle arms race. Artificial intelligence and autonomy have his full attention now as he stakes the company's future on robotaxis, seemingly only confirming ""more affordable"" new models out of investor pressure.
But if Tesla is walking back its Supercharger growth plans—and cutting the team behind them seems to indicate that—it's an entirely new level of weird for Tesla.
You could make a strong argument that building out its proprietary charging network is the smartest thing Tesla ever did. Way back in 2012, when the Model S was just starting to emerge, Tesla realized that widespread adoption of its products would never happen unless it stepped outside the auto industry's traditional lane—i.e., letting other companies handle ""fueling""—and built the charging infrastructure itself. It then quickly scaled its charging network across the country and the world, learning much along the way. The Supercharger network became one of the biggest networks anywhere and the gold standard for how charging itself should work.
Doing everything in-house at Tesla was once a necessity for operating in an industry that had little to no support for EVs. It quickly turned into a key strength, allowing the company to control the entire car ownership experience from top to bottom—including charging. Today, Tesla Supercharging is seamless, easy to use and ubiquitous. Almost every other EV driver has looked with envy at Tesla drivers charging their cars without a care in the world, all while they fought with the credit card reader at an EVGo station or the like.
The Supercharger network even paid dividends for the entire concept of electric vehicles. Tesla showed that it could be done; that a huge, reliable and fast network of chargers could be built and that range anxiety could be made a thing of the past. In many ways, building out that charging network was the best thing Tesla has ever done.
It was no wonder that rival automakers spent much of 2023 announcing they would switch to Tesla's proprietary North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and allow access to the Supercharger network. That's been widely seen as a win-win for all involved; Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Rivian and the rest get access to the best charging network around, and Tesla would gain an estimated $20 billion in charging revenue alone by 2030. Not to mention, of course, billions more from the Biden Administration's investments in EV charging grants.
By Tesla's own accounting, it grew Supercharger stations by 26% year-over-year by Q1's end and owned some 30% of America's DC fast-charging infrastructure. EV owners were excited to get their NACS adapters and eventually easier native charging. Competitors like ChargePoint were offering the same plugs too, and Tesla seemed poised to rake in cash. Just last week, The Atlantic even likened Tesla to some kind of new Con Edison, less an automaker and more an energy provider.
As Jay-Z once put it, ""It was all good just a week ago."" But when it comes to Tesla and Musk, a lot can happen in a week.
Emails to other automakers from InsideEVs have not received responses yet, and nor have messages seeking comment to Tesla's communications teams in other parts of the world.
It's possible that Musk saw that the Supercharger ecosystem somehow wasn't growing quickly enough for his tastes; Bloomberg recently noted that Tesla didn't hit its target of tripling the network between 2021 and 2023. (It merely doubled it instead!) Perhaps Musk wants a new team that can get it done sooner. Then again, who? Christmas just came early for every automaker looking to hire top-tier charging talent.
What's more likely is the obvious: that this is all part of Tesla's wholesale pivot to AI and robotaxis. That, in Musk's mind, those areas are where Tesla will put the most resources and talent until it has fully ""solved"" the challenge of autonomous driving. For countless reasons, that pivot seems suspect, and the idea that Tesla's past success will guarantee its future has its limits.
In the meantime, losing a 500-person team responsible for charging probably isn't great for Tesla owners. Questions arise about maintenance, upkeep and new features, to say nothing of new station rollouts.
It's also very unlikely that these layoffs will impact the industry-wide pivot to the NACS plug. That's becoming an SAE standard, so it's effectively out of Tesla's hands. One industry official who spoke to me indicated the move could slow other automakers' moves to the actual Supercharger network, however, but it's still unclear how.
In the end, the only person who can articulate the path forward is Musk. He spent the past 12 hours on X posting about slavery, woke TV shows and declining birth rates, so what happens next is anyone's guess. But slowing the growth of one of the best reasons to buy an electric car isn't good for anyone—not the industry, and certainly not the planet.
Musk seems more focused on Tesla's stock price as of late. Unfortunately for him, even investors don't like this move. Tesla stock is down 5% as of publication, a sign that even Wall Street is baffled by gutting such a key part of the company's empire.

"Honda Will Spend $11B To Build EVs, Battery Packs In Canada",https://insideevs.com/news/717521/honda-investment-canada-evs/,"Honda has been building cars in Canada since the 1980s, but now it wants to go electric and have a complete local supply chain.",4/25/2024 17:00,"Today, Honda confirmed plans to expand its manufacturing presence in Canada to build electric vehicles. The Japanese automaker announced a massive $11 billion investment—the largest single automotive investment in Canada’s history—that will lead to the creation of new plants near its existing manufacturing campus in Alliston, Ontario, with the goal of beginning EV production in 2027.
The investment will see the construction of four new manufacturing plants: one for EVs, one for battery packs and two plants that will manufacture battery components. Honda intends to create a complete local EV supply chain that will help it build EVs at a competitive price and with a lower environmental impact (it wants to only build EVs and FCEVs after 2040 with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050).
Honda is lagging behind other manufacturers
While other automakers already have entire parallel lineups of bespoke electric cars, Honda only sells two EVs of which only one is of its own making, the e:NY1.
The new EV assembly plant has a projected output of 240,000 vehicles per year, while the battery plant will be able to produce 36 gigawatt-hours of EV batteries annually. Between all four new factories, Honda says it will add 1,000 new jobs on top of the 4,200 people it already employs.
Honda currently builds the CR-V and Civic in Canada, and it will add at least two new models by 2028.
There is no word yet on what vehicles will roll out of the new factory, but Automotive News quotes an industry analyst who believes that the first will be a small Honda-badged electric crossover expected to debut in 2027, followed one year later by a larger Acura electric crossover.
Unlike today’s Honda Prologue, which is built for Honda by General Motors on its own Ultium architecture, these new models will be underpinned by a new bespoke EV architecture that will debut in 2025.
More Honda 
Honda showcased what its new line of EVs will look like with a series of concepts that debuted in January. The one that will serve as direct inspiration for a production model is the Saloon, which looks a lot like a small handheld vacuum cleaner—a Dustbuster—and it will spawn a production EV called the Honda 0.
This will be Honda’s first “next-generation” EV, and its design will likely serve as the basis for future models, including the crossover that enters production in Ontario in 2027. Honda also wants to turn its Ohio manufacturing facilities in the US into an ""EV hub"" where it plans to start electric vehicle production in 2025.",Andrei Nedelea
Elon Musk Says Tesla Is An A.I. Company. He Should Let Someone Else Make The Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/717357/tesla-should-spin-off-car-business/,"Elon Musk clearly doesn't want to run a car company. So let him run ""Tesla"" as an AI company, and turn Tesla's car business into its own company.",4/25/2024 14:30,"Elon Musk insists that Tesla is an A.I. company. Never mind that the company makes almost all of its money selling cars, or that it sells more electric cars than any other company in the U.S. and that it currently produces the best-selling car in the world. It is not a car company, Musk insists. It's an A.I. company. Sure, fine, whatever. But if that's true, he ought to let someone else make the cars.
Because as its CEO has gotten increasingly bored of the car market, Tesla has started to slip in the car market. Its market share is declining. Its newest product is expensive, fraught with quality problems and late. It has had to cut prices again and again and again to improve demand for its core products. Its flagship sedan and SUV are built on a platform that debuted during Obama's first term. The Semi is still nowhere. The Roadster doesn't exist. The Model 2 might be dead.
No wonder Musk doesn't want Tesla to be valued as a car company.
He focuses his public comments, his product strategy and his earnings calls on Tesla's progress with A.I. He promises that Tesla will solve autonomy. The whole value of the company, he says, is contingent on Tesla's lead in A.I. and autonomous vehicles.
""If you value Tesla as just like an auto company[...] it's just the wrong framework. And if you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible. So, I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,"" Musk said on the earnings call.
Analysts are buying it. Morgan Stanley's Tesla Analyst Adam Jonas considered Tesla's ""auto business"" to account for just 20% of the stock's $310 per share value. Other firms have similar approaches. They see great potential in Tesla's A.I. business, from autonomous driving to building humanoid robots that can work factory jobs.
I do not believe that Tesla has demonstrated any leadership in solving autonomy or generalized A.I., except maybe running a not-autonomous driver assistance system and extremely limited hardware.
A render of the Model 2, which may have been canceled.
Regardless of how you assess its current position, though, Tesla has two exceedingly complicated problems to solve. The first is to maintain its dominant position as one of the world's most sophisticated, popular and profitable electric vehicle companies. The second is to wholly transform into an A.I. powerhouse with a fundamentally reshaped business model.
Both markets are important. But it's clear that Musk only cares about one. So why not spin the carmaking arm into a separate business, and let a true adult run that execution-oriented, capital-intensive business?
The truth is that long-term, long-game carmaking isn't built for Elon Musk. Selling millions of cars per year means accurately planning years out, something that just isn't in his skillset. It requires diligent work with regulators, slow, plodding investments in service and retention and constant tweaks to price and product strategy. It prioritizes slow improvement over rapid reinvention, for better and for worse.
It's Musk's worst nightmare. He has built an empire on rapid growth. Take an untapped market, exploit it first and outmaneuver competitors in an ever-changing landscape. Be whatever the shareholders want you to be. Use any model, piss off anyone as long as it keeps the stock going up. Forget steady profits. Sell infinite growth. A boundless horizon. Don't give people want, decide what they want and sell it to them.
It's a strong playbook for a startup. No meteoric stock gain is based on slow, consistent improvement, it's based on growth. This approach is perfect for an A.I. company that needs to be nimble, and Musk is right that he's probably the best to lead it. I don't want Elon Musk having the power to shape what the future of A.I. looks like, but I get why investors put money behind him. Do you really think anyone is going to get in his way?
The only person who consistently gets in Musk's way is Musk himself. The man's quick, gut-driven pivots don't seem to work out well when the business is mature. He's prodded every dial and button at X—nee Twitter— and the result is clear: The website that once defined the online conversation is now a cesspool of spam and bigotry. It's never had a worse relationship with its advertisers. And its CEO has never been so radioactive.
And yet America can't afford for the same fate to befall Tesla's auto-making efforts. The company is just too important. Very few other automakers right now offer such a compelling slate of EVs backed by Silicon Valley-grade software, a dealer-free buyer experience and an internally built, reliable charging network. Tesla is not just important to the EV market; it is important to the U.S.' strategic geopolitical position. It is the only large-scale EV manufacturer in the country that has global relevance, the chops to compete with Chinese EV manufacturers and an existing, satisfied EV customer base.
It doesn't need a disruptor in charge. It needs an executive. One who executes. Someone who can helm a complicated, large organization while retaining the institutional knowledge and talent to keep its edge over the competition. It doesn't need to solve autonomy to succeed.
It needs a suspension team that doesn't rotate through 20-somethings every six months, giving us no real clue whether the Model 3 Performance will outdrive an M3 (like the last one) or end up a total mess (like the Model S Plaid).
It does not need one big swing. It needs a million little decisions, made by a CEO that isn't distracted by SpaceX, X, Dojo, autonomy and anger over ""the woke mind virus.""
It needs its own leadership, its own organization, its own name. Call it The Car Company. Or X Auto. Or Bob, for all I care. Let Elon keep shipping cars with ""FSD Supervised,"" but have that be software licensed to X Auto by Tesla, the A.I. Company. That gives the A.I. division the name Elon wants, a guaranteed buyer for its flagship product, access to fleet learning data from X Auto and the ability to sell autonomous software and humanoid robots to whoever he damn-well pleases.
Meanwhile, The Car Company can focus on what really matters: Making cars that people want to buy. Redesigning the Model S. Switching the Model 3 over to an 800-volt architecture. Building out V4 Superchargers.
These projects all surely sound boring to Elon Musk. That's exactly why he shouldn't be in charge of them.

"Ford Will Build Profitable, Affordable Sub-$30,000 EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/717373/ford-q1-2024-earnings-takeaway/,"Ford isn't making money selling EVs, but it's learning that consumers want cheap EVs. Ford promises to deliver them.",4/24/2024 18:02,"Ford reported falling electric vehicle revenue on Wednesday, but executives seemed optimistic in the earnings call. CEO Jim Farley affirmed that what the market wants is affordable EVs, and Ford is well-positioned to offer them in the next generation of products. They'll be profitable, he promised, and in the meantime Ford is adding capacity for its well-established hybrids, like the F-150 PowerBoost and Maverick Hybrid.
It was an optimistic call for a brand that has struggled to woo investors. The company is one of the cheapest in the world when it comes to its share price versus its earnings, a sign that investors have little confidence in the core business. But Ford's deeply rooted fleet business is massive, its hybrid portfolio is solid and in-demand and its Mach-E EV is the second-best-selling EV SUV in America, behind the Tesla Model Y.
Ford's Revised EV Plan
Ford had to dial back its expectations for EV adoption. But the company thinks it is now on the right track, with a fleet of solid hybrid options and the popular Mustang Mach-E. The hard step will be not just selling EVs, but doing so profitably.
The Mach-E has seen a rapid sales increase since Ford cut prices by 17 percent. Farley said that affordability is the number one concern, as evidenced by that sales increase. He promised that the next generation of Ford EVs will be affordable and profitable. This focus comes as Tesla has reportedly lost interest in its rumored ""Model 2"" affordable EV, which may have been abandoned in favor of Musk's promised Robotaxi.
Either way, Ford says the Maverick, F-150, F-250 and Ranger are all selling fast, and that it is on track to build up a profitable EV business as the ICE business continues to generate cashflow. To keep the business relevant and reduce emissions, Farley says Ford will have hybrids in every segment. The trick is keeping prices under control as consumers fight higher interest rates, which make it far more expensive to borrow on expensive cars and trucks.
But again, Ford's goal is to have a strategic advantage in affordable EVs. General Motors is trying to make the same play with the Chevy Equinox EV, and Tesla with the Model Y. It's not clear who will win the race to offer a long-range EV that is affordable for young and less affluent buyers, but I'm happy that more companies are chasing that market.
""What's really exciting for us is we see an opening in the market,"" Farley said. ""We believe we can be profitable at $25,000 or $30,000.""

"Tesla Says New Vehicles, Including 'Affordable' Models, Are Coming. Musk Has Few Details (Updated)",https://insideevs.com/news/717203/tesla-q1-affordable-2025/,The automaker's eagerly anticipated Q1 filing has a few details about what's needed most: new models. Musk would rather talk robots instead.,4/23/2024 18:23,"[April 23, 6:07 PM Eastern: This story has been updated with details from Tesla's earnings call.]
Lately, it's been a fair question whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk remembers he's running a car company—or if he even wants to. Much to the chagrin of investors, owners and fans everywhere, word on the street lately is that Tesla's big focus is robots, AI and autonomously-driven robotaxis instead of a supposedly $25,000 EV. All of that comes at a time when Tesla's car lineup is older than ever, and losing ground to new electric competitors.
But Tesla's Q1 2024 financial report, which was released today ahead of its quarterly earnings call, seems to affirm that some new vehicles are indeed coming soon—including ""more affordable"" models.
Then again, the CEO himself had little to say about any of these models, preferring to opine about AI, the robotaxi service, the Optimus robot and autonomous driving instead.
""We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,"" the report said. ""These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.""
""So we expect it to be more like early 2025, if not late this year,"" Musk said on the earnings call. ""It's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently. And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity."" In 2023, Tesla produced about 1.8 million vehicles.
Beyond that, Musk didn't seem at all interested in elaborating on an actual product roadmap. At several points during Tuesday evening's call, he either demurred or waved off questions about what was coming next—including when one analyst asked if ""new products"" meant updates like the Highland Model 3, or entirely new cars.
Instead, Musk wanted to talk not about how Tesla is going to fend off Hyundai or Nissan, but how it's going to deploy a network of autonomous taxis under a service he likened to Airbnb or Uber.
""We should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,"" Musk told the analyst. ""If you value Tesla as as just like an auto company... it's just the wrong framework. And if you ask the wrong question, the right answer is impossible.""
Both Musk and today's report stop far short of what many investors and Tesla-watchers probably wanted: confirmation of that $25,000 EV, and maybe announcements of new crossovers and sedans to replace the aging Model S, X, Y and 3. (The Roadster is said to be in the cards as well, but like the Cybertruck before it, it has been long-delayed and is likely to be an expensive niche product.)
Earlier, the robotaxi—reportedly some kind of fully autonomous vehicle that Tesla will deploy in an unspecified new ""service""—was said to ride on the same next-generation platform as the more affordable compact car. But earlier this month Reuters reported that program had been canceled, something Musk later denied. Its current status is unclear, but industry observers believe that more affordable EVs will be key to wider adoption, and that Tesla is positioned to deliver on them first—that is, if competitors from China and even players like Kia and Ford don't beat Tesla to the punch.
Besides the Cybertruck, which launched to a more expensive price tag and less range than anticipated, most of Tesla's new models as of late have been updates of existing ones, like the upgraded Model 3. Earlier today, Tesla formally unveiled the Performance variant of that sedan. But entirely new models from the ground up are nowhere to be found, and that has investors and fans alike concerned about the company's ability to do battle with the competition.
It is possible that Musk will elaborate further on the upcoming models in tonight's earnings call. If that happens, we will update this story.

New York City’s Electric Rideshare Cars Surpass Two Million Trips In March,https://insideevs.com/news/717112/nyc-rideshare-evs-two-million-trips-march/,"In the first quarter of 2024, NYC saved some 731,000 gallons of gas thanks to electric rideshare cars.",4/23/2024 12:00,"If you’re a curious New York City resident or visitor, you’ve likely heard the faint hum of traction motors emanating from electric cars with Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) registration plates.
Mostly Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys, but also some Toyota bZ4xs and Polestar 2s among others, these EVs are everywhere in the five boroughs of the world's financial and cultural capital. They ferry customers in near-silence, leaving no trail of no planet-warming fumes. Nearly 25,000 all-electric and hybrid Uber, Lyft and other rideshare cars now ply in NYC and these drivers are going all guns blazing with usage rates.
NYC's massive undertaking to electrify yellow cabs.
To curb emissions from transportation, electrifying commercial fleets and rideshare/ride-hail cars is as important as making private cars go green. NYC is leading that charge with the largest fleet of rideshare cars in the country, which is now covering millions of EV trips monthly, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of planet-warming gas.
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission—the agency responsible for licensing and regulating yellow taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles—announced yesterday that rideshare EV trips surpassed two million in March alone. That’s double from a million trips covered in January.
This comes after the City of New York passed its Green Rides Initiative, mandating all new for-hire vehicles (FHV) to be electric from November 2023 onwards. The rules led to a sudden surge in FHV license applications, with NYC TLC's daily intake soaring from 150 to 2,000 applications overnight, a TLC spokesperson told InsideEVs early this year.
From an emissions perspective, these rules are reaping huge benefits. Since November, monthly EV trips increased fivefold, from 362,000 before.
EV trips in the first three months of the year have saved some 6,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, covering 25 million miles in zero emissions trips. That’s the equivalent of saving 731,000 gallons of gas, according to the NYC TLC. It’s also equivalent to “carbon sequestered by 107,000 tree seedlings for about 10 years.”
The Green Rides Initiative initially aimed to electrify five percent of the rideshare fleet in 2024, increasing to 15 percent in 2025. However, due to an overwhelming response from FHV drivers, NYC TLC attained that goal in January 2024, two years ahead of schedule—the current penetration of electric and wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV) trips stands at 17%.
When TLC passed the new rules in October 2023, thousands of drivers jumped at Teslas. But an InsideEVs investigation found that they were getting little charging support in return.
At one Tesla Supercharger in Brooklyn, drivers were waiting up to 90 minutes to recharge their EVs due to long lines and limited charging options with no parking fees. This left them frustrated, as some of them were losing up to two hours of business daily due to “traffic jams” at overcrowded charging stations.
Realizing the massive need to improve these drivers' charging experience, the TLC and the City of New York are slowly investing in charging infrastructure.
Recently, ride-hail startup Revel—which operates neon blue Teslas in the city—announced a project to build the largest fast-charging site by an airport in the U.S. It will be located at the LaGuardia airport in Queens. Google-backed charging start-up Gravity’s 500-kilowatt round-the-clock fast-charging site opened in February in Times Square—this one is the fastest charging station in the U.S.—InsideEVs tried it out recently.
The NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) also recently opened five new Level 3 chargers at the World’s Fair Marina parking lot, close to the Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens.

Tesla Sales Declines Put U.S. EV Registrations Into The Red For First Time Since 2020,https://insideevs.com/news/716952/new-us-ev-registrations-negative-february-2024-tesla/,"Without Tesla, which is the biggest player by far in the EV game, the numbers actually went up compared to last year.",4/22/2024 11:56,"Tesla makes or breaks the EV industry’s numbers–that’s a fact, whether you like it or not. When Tesla’s delivery and registration figures go up, the whole segment goes up. When Tesla sees a prominent dip in sales–as it did in the first quarter of this year–the U.S. EV sector goes down with it. This is how big Tesla’s influence is.
Take the month of February, the latest for which registration data is available, courtesy of S&P Global Mobility. According to Automotive News, Tesla’s new registrations went down a whopping 25% compared to the same month last year, making the entire EV segment’s new registrations in the U.S. drop 2.8%. The last time this happened was in August 2020, when Tesla’s U.S. registrations fell by 2% and the total new EV registrations dropped by 6%.
Can you have an EV market without Tesla?
If we were to take Tesla out of the equation, new EV registrations in the United States went up 32% in February, compared to the same month last year. With Tesla, the numbers went down 2.8%.
But can we have a modern EV industry without the company that basically invented the long-range, mass-market EV?
The negative numbers appeared despite the fact that every other EV maker in the country saw consistent gains in the second month of this year, including Rivian, Ford, Hyundai, Kia and BMW. Without Tesla, the EV sector in the U.S. actually went up a massive 32%. Keep in mind that these are registration numbers, not production or delivery stats, which are different.

But when looking at what volume Tesla is pushing, even during a weak quarter, it’s clear that without it, the EV landscape would be scarcer.
Ford’s new EV registrations went up 84% in February compared to the same period last year, with 7,656 cars registered. Hyundai’s registrations rose 54% and reached 3,822 cars. Kia saw an increase of 58% in registrations, hitting 3,722 units. BMW had a 166% increase to 3,559 registrations. Rivian had 3,251 new registrations in February, an increase of 56% compared to the year-earlier month.
The five aforementioned car companies had 22,010 combined new EV registrations in February, according to S&P Global Mobility, while Tesla alone had 36,697 new registrations. Total EV registrations amounted to 78,361 cars, making the electric vehicle share of the U.S. light-vehicle market drop to 6.2% from 7% in February 2023.

The main reason for Tesla’s–and the EV sector’s decline–in February was the poor performance of the Tesla Model 3 in terms of registrations. The company’s entry-level EV saw a decline of 73%, partly because of the model losing eligibility for the $7,500 tax credit at the beginning of the year and partly because the American EV maker introduced the refreshed version in the first quarter of this year–a move that was associated with a temporary production halt for retooling the Fremont Gigafactory.
The Model Y, which is by far the most popular EV in the United States, saw registration figures drop by 6.7% in February, reaching 28,664 units, while the Model 3 had just 4,423 new registrations. Registrations of the Model S went down 1.8% to 501 cars, while the Model X saw an increase of 47% to 2,537 units. The Model X and Model Y are eligible for the Federal Tax Credit for new EVs, while the Model 3 and Model S are not, according to Tesla’s website, which might explain the uptick in Model X registrations.",Iulian Dnistran
The Volkswagen ID.4 Will Soon Be A Union-Made EV,https://insideevs.com/news/716835/vw-tennessee-uaw-vote/,"The vote represents a major coup for the United Auto Workers, and means one of VW's most important cars will soon be union-made.",4/20/2024 10:48,"Of all the cars built at Volkswagen's Chattanooga Assembly Plant in Tennessee, it's not hard to argue that the Volkswagen ID.4 is the one most important to the automaker's future. It's VW's first modern all-electric model—a symbol of what's to come as it eventually moves away from gasoline, aimed squarely at the ultra-important U.S. market. And now, it will soon be a union-made EV as well.
Workers at VW's Tennessee plant ""overwhelmingly"" voted to join the United Auto Workers union this week, as Automotive News put it, with the ""yes"" camp scoring 73% of the vote. Volkswagen officials said 2,628 workers were in favor, with 985 against.
The UAW and the electric future
Starting with strikes on Detroit's Big Three last year, the UAW has sought to reverse decades of losses to its membership. The push comes at a time when many U.S. auto workers fear for their jobs, if a move to electric vehicles requires less manufacturing labor since the cars have so many fewer parts.
“We saw the big contract that UAW workers won at the Big Three and that got everybody talking,” Zachary Costello, a trainer in VW’s proficiency room, said in a statement released on the UAW's website. “You see the pay, the benefits, the rights UAW members have on the job, and you see how that would change your life. That’s why we voted overwhelmingly for the union. Once people see the difference a union makes, there’s no way to stop them.”
In a short statement, Volkswagen officials said: ""The vote was administered through a democratic, secret ballot vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board.  We will await certification of the results by the NLRB. Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.""
After the votes are certified, VW must begin negotiations with the workers for a contract at the plant.
As Costello noted, the VW workers' union vote comes on the heels of historic strikes against the Detroit Big Three last year, which resulted in record wage and benefit gains after years of decline following the Great Recession and bailouts. They were the product of a newly energized and rather militant UAW—a union infamous for corruption scandals, close ties to automakers and ineffectiveness—that is dead-set on reversing decades of membership losses. And in recent weeks alone, the union drive at VW Chattanooga had faced staunch opposition from Republican governors in the South, all of whom oppose unionization at the many car plants in their states.
The union vote was a groundbreaking one on multiple fronts.
It represents the first time a so-called ""foreign"" plant in the U.S. south voted to join the UAW, after years of similar campaigns failing. Two similar attempts to unionize at Chattanooga faltered in recent years. (Volkswagen's Westmoreland, Pennsylvania plant was a union shop, but it closed in 1988.) It also means that Volkswagen will be a union automaker much like it is in its home country of Germany. And, obviously, it is a major win for the UAW as it gains momentum to try and unionize at Mercedes-Benz soon and other automakers down the line, including possibly Tesla.
But even more so, the UAW vote in Tennessee could be seen as big news for electric vehicles, and American labor's role in making them.
Though UAW President Shawn Fain has been adamant that the union is not against EVs, many workers fear that the moves to more EV production—which generally requires less labor and fewer parts than combustion car production—will mean fewer U.S. manufacturing jobs. Indeed, that talking point has been used heavily by politicians who oppose regulations driving more EV adoption, including former President Donald Trump. And Volkswagen too hasn't shied away from the importance of its Chattanooga plant to the future of cars, with a battery engineering plant onsite and efforts to retrain its workforce to make EVs. Furthermore, the UAW has sought to unionize EV battery plants in the U.S. as well, which generally pay much less for hourly labor than union car plants do.
All of this has begged the question: will the electric future of cars in America be built by union labor, or not? And after Friday night's results, the answer is that it just might be.

"‘No Incentives For You,’ Mexico Tells Chinese Carmakers After U.S. Pressure",https://insideevs.com/news/716738/mexico-restricts-chinese-ev-investments/,A major win for U.S. automakers as Mexico halts all future meetings with Chinese carmakers and stops incentives for local factories.,4/19/2024 10:00,"The potential influx of cheap Chinese electric cars into the U.S. through Mexico had ruffled the feathers of American carmakers. This prompted U.S. officials to raise concerns to their Chinese counterparts about the country’s manufacturing overcapacity. They’ve also been urging Mexico to keep Chinese carmakers at bay—a measure to safeguard America’s massive homegrown car industry. The fruits of these diplomatic efforts have now led Mexico to align with the U.S. to fend off cheap Chinese EVs.
At a meeting with Chinese OEMs in January, Mexican officials said the country would refrain from granting incentives to Chinese automakers. They added that the country was suspending all future discussions with them, sources who preferred anonymity told Reuters. Mexican officials have not met any Chinese automakers since then. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) reportedly urged Mexico to restrict Chinese investments.
U.S.-China trade tensions affect the EV industry
China has emerged as the goliath in electric vehicle manufacturing, with much of its expertise in making top-quality and affordable EVs. As its manufacturing capacity grows, U.S. auto executives fear that cheap Chinese EVs will destroy the domestic American car market. But Mexico's alignment with U.S. policy should come as a major victory for U.S. OEMs.
A USTR official said that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) designed to foster free trade in North America wasn’t meant to be a loophole for Chinese automakers to exploit. The news comes after representatives from Mexico’s Economy and Foreign Relations ministries traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with U.S. officials for high-level talks. The USTR did not respond to InsideEVs request for comment at the time of publication.
About 20 Chinese carmakers are already present in Mexico, including BYD which sells models like the Dolphin Mini, Yuan Plus and Han EV among several others. But these are Chinese-made imports—the country’s carmakers have yet to build a plant there. BYD is now chasing state incentives to build a local factory, even if they’re substantially lower than federal funding, according to Reuters. States like Durango in the northwest and Nuevo Leon in the northeast among others are wide-ranging incentives to Chinese carmakers.
Nuevo Leon last December approved $153 million in incentives for a Tesla plant. Despite acquiring all the required permits towards the end of 2023, Tesla’s factory in Mexico has faced some delays—CEO Elon Musk attributed the delay to the integration of advanced manufacturing tech. But construction of the Mexico Gigafactory began in March, according to local news outlet Milenio, citing comments from Nuevo Leon Governor Samuel Garcia Sepulveda.
This should ease the pressure on U.S. automakers, as the possibility of Chinese automakers circumventing tariffs has likely diminished. But its repercussions on Mexico’s domestic market and the wider Latin America remains to be seen. However, countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile are also attractive destinations for Chinese automakers. They have welcomed them with open arms, with brands like Chery Auto already announcing a factory worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Argentina.
All said, with an industry-wide slowdown in demand for EVs and the urgency to bring affordable EVs to combat planet-warming emissions, Mexico restricting Chinese investment shouldn’t be a reason for American EV makers to let their guard down.

Affordable Kia EV3 Will Put Kia Ahead Of Countless Rivals: Exec,https://insideevs.com/news/716716/kia-affordable-evs-us/,And EV3 isn't all. Kia aims for eight electric models on sale in the U.S. by 2029 and establish itself as a leader in affordable EVs.,4/19/2024 8:39,"Kia has demonstrated that it can create winning electric vehicles like the EV6 GT and three-row EV9. But it also believes it's about to be ahead of rivals in making affordable EVs—the next great frontier for the electric world. Now, with the upcoming EV3 subcompact crossover and the EV4 sedan, Kia expects to see significantly increased EV adoption, an executive said in a recent interview.
According to Kia America COO Steve Center, who spoke with Automotive News, “We're ahead of most, and we're trying to rush out ahead because our technology will be more evolved. You can't just jump in and catch up. You have to have your own R&D, your own secret sauce.”
Kia's major EV push is underway
The Korean automaker wants to make ""EVs for all,"" and that includes many more models. In some ways, it's already there. The most affordable EV that Kia sells in the US is the Niro EV, which starts at under $40,000 before any rebates and incentives.
The production version of the EV3 crossover is expected to debut early this summer, and the EV4 should be revealed sometime after that. Automotive News also speculates the EV3 could be priced around $32,000 if it ends up coming to the U.S.—a price tag that very few modern electrics can match.
Bringing the cost of EVs down is a key concern for all automakers, but Kia wants to establish itself as a leader in affordable EVs with many of its upcoming models. Its main rival in this endeavor isn’t another established automaker or even Tesla, which reportedly shifted focus away from the development of its $25,000 EV, but Chinese giants like BYD, Geely and Nio, whose offerings are priced very keenly while offering comparable quality to EVs from the established players.
Chinese EVs have an almost insignificant presence in the US today, but many carmakers from China have plans to expand into the States like they’re already doing in parts of Europe. By the time they reach the US, though, Kia expects to have a big chunk of the EV market to itself, especially at the more affordable end of the market.
Center spoke about the $7,500 federal tax credit and noted that “when you look at the market, the [current] buyers are wealthier, and their incomes phase them out of the rebate if they buy [the vehicle]. But if they lease the car, which most of them do anyway, they get the rebate. When you're building affordable EVs in the U.S., the rebate will appeal more to households with less income.”
Kia has only announced plans to build one EV in the US, its most expensive electric offering, the EV9, which will roll off the assembly line at its factory in Buford, Georgia. It has not announced any official plans to build another EV there or open up a new production facility elsewhere in the country, but Center’s statement makes it sound like this is being considered so that its affordable EVs become even more attractive thanks to the significant federal rebate.

Volkswagen’s Upcoming Cheap EVs In China Will Use Xpeng Tech,https://insideevs.com/news/716562/vw-xpeng-electrical-architecture-evs-china/,Four entry-level EVs will debut in 2026 using Xpeng’s electronic architecture to slash costs by up to 40%.,4/18/2024 10:00,"The Volkswagen Group, which owns car brands like Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, wants to stay ahead of the pack in the world’s largest and most competitive electric car market, China.
Last year, the Volkswagen brand lost the top spot in the Chinese sales charts after a 15-year reign after being dethroned by BYD, so the German-based group that owns the maker of the Passat and ID.4 wants to regain some of that lost momentum with help from local player Xpeng.
VW goes on the offensive in China with help from local players
Volkswagen had a bit of a rough time last year in China when it came to sales. The German car brand lost the top spot in the charts after ruling them for over 15 years, so something had to change.
To try and make things better (and cheaper), VW will launch four cheap EVs in China with help from local player Xpeng.
The partnership between the two companies will result in four affordable Volkswagen-branded battery-powered cars engineered specifically for the Chinese market that will utilize Xpeng’s know-how in electric and electronic architectures. Think advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) and over-the-air updates.

According to the German group, the new zonal E/E architecture bearing the name China Electrical Architecture (CEA) will be jointly developed by Xpeng, Volkswagen China Technology Company (VCTC) and CARIAD China.
This is different from the running gear architecture that integrates things like the traction battery and motors. In China, the upcoming affordable EVs made in collaboration with Xpeng will be based on the so-called China Main Platform (CMP), which–rather confusingly–is being developed in collaboration with the SAIC Volkswagen and FAW Volkswagen joint ventures.
The biggest benefit of Xpeng’s involvement in VW’s upcoming electric cars will be a significant reduction in costs. The German company said that it’s expecting a 40% drop in costs compared to the current MEB platform thanks to the reduced complexity and lower number of control units that come with the adoption of Xpeng’s E/E tech.
Besides the four entry EVs that will debut in 2026, the new China Electrical Architecture will also be embedded in two mid-range Volkswagen EVs that are jointly developed with Xpeng, the first of which will be an SUV. Just like their cheaper siblings, these more upmarket models will also hit the Chinese market in two years.
""Competition is very fierce, and we have to adapt our cost structure to be competitive in this environment,"" Volkswagen Group board member and China chief Ralf Brandstaetter said for Reuters.
Last year, the Volkswagen Group acquired a 4.99% stake in Xpeng for approximately $700 million in a bid to fast-track the development of the aforementioned pair of mid-size electric models.",Iulian Dnistran
The Three-Row Toyota Highlander Is Going Electric: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/716570/toyota-highlander-ev-headed-to-the-us/,There's also a bZ3x electric crossover in the pipeline for launch in 2026.,4/18/2024 7:58,"Despite the pressing urgency posed by climate change, Toyota has been slow to embrace electric vehicles. In the process, environment groups have labeled it a “laggard.” But even Toyota must know it can't keep that up forever, and so things are reportedly changing—including turning the popular Highlander crossover into an all-electric model.
That comes to us from veteran automotive journalist Paul Eisenstein, writing for CarBuzz. In the report, the outlet says Toyota not only plans to convert the Highlander to an EV-only model but that same EV will spawn into a posh Lexus version. Toyota has already filed trademark applications for the names TZ450e and TZ550e with the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
Toyota dragged its feet with EVs
The world's largest carmaker by sales volumes is immensely influential when it comes to policy decisions. Citing things like EPA's initial regulations were ""bad for the country"" and vowing to not ""back down,"" Toyota's lobbyists held their own and got what they wanted—a slower transition to EVs, but at a cost to the environment.
We are reaching out to Toyota for comment and will update this story if we get one.
This move makes sense, because Toyota sold some 169,543 Highlanders in 2023, making it its second-best-selling SUV in the U.S. after the RAV4. The Highlander’s Q1 2024 sales are down 40%, but if Toyota can spice up the model with a punchy electric powertrain, enough range and a fresh design, some of the Highlander’s loyal customer base might consider making the switch—a win-win for all.
Meanwhile, Toyota won’t desert its gas and hybrid car customer base. CarBuzz added that the Grand Highlander would continue with an internal combustion engine, likely with hybrid and plug-in hybrid options. This should bode well with the Japanese automaker’s multi-pronged approach to electrification, which includes selling conventional hybrids, EVs, PHEVs and FCEVs concurrently.
Toyota currently only offers two EVs in the U.S., the lackluster bZ4x crossover and its cousin, the Lexus RZ450e—they’re the same underneath but wear different clothes.
The brand staunchly opposed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) initial emissions proposal, which aimed at aggressive EV adoption through stringent emissions targets. But after fierce lobbying, Toyota got what it wanted: loosened emissions rules that allow a more gradual adoption of EVs.
But in 2021, Toyota announced 30 new BEVs to be launched worldwide by 2020. Most concepts showcased back then carried the “bz” nameplate, an abbreviation for “beyond zero.” The following number denotes vehicle class and x denotes all-wheel drive. That’s how you get the rather confusing bZ4x nameplate.
One of the concepts Toyota showcased in 2021 was labeled the “bZ Large SUV,” a three-row family SUV riding on a dedicated BEV platform to be manufactured at the brand’s Georgetown, Kentucky plant from 2026 onwards. It was rumored to get the production name of bZ5x, although CarBuzz reported Toyota wouldn’t adopt the alphanumeric nomenclature for all models.
That’s not all. A compact electric crossover, expected to be named the bZ3x, and a compact sedan are apparently coming in 2026 as well, sources familiar with the matter told the news outlet. We suspect that the electric crossover would be the production version of the bZ compact SUV concept that Toyota showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show in 2022. A similar Lexus version would land in the U.S. by 2027, the report stated.
The Toyota bZ3 sedan, built by a joint venture between FAW and Toyota, is already on sale in China.
All things considered, retaining the Highlander nameplate is a significant decision. And the rationale behind that seems straightforward. The bZ4x's underwhelming 252-mile range and maximum fast charging speed of 150 kilowatts, far below many rivals, have failed to impress. Moreover, its unappealing alphanumeric name isn’t helping either. Consumer reception to the bZ4x has been lukewarm, with Toyota selling only about 1,897 units in Q1 2024.
However, the Highlander is a household name in the U.S., and that raises an important question. Should Toyota abandon its alphanumeric nomenclature entirely and rely on established names for its future EVs? Should it also bring the Tundra and Tacoma under the EV umbrella in the future? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Jeep's Electric SUVs Could Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/716367/jeep-wagoneer-s-recon-gasoline-engines/,The Wagoneer S and Recon EVs could be joined by ICE models to bolster sales.,12/25/2024 7:30,"From 973,227 vehicles sold in 2018 to 643,000 units in 2023–that's quite the downfall for Jeep. It's suffered five consecutive years of decline. Axing the affordable Renegade and Cherokee certainly didn't help, but new CEO Antonio Filosa has a plan. The Wagoneer S and Recon are coming as electric SUVs. In addition, gasoline versions are apparently being considered as well.
Speaking with Automotive News, Jeep's boss admitted the two future electric SUVs might be joined by conventionally powered derivatives. This would be possible thanks to the STLA Large platform that has already underpinned the new Dodge Charger. It's an EV-centric architecture that can accommodate ICEs as well. The next-generation Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio are getting this hardware, too.
Jeep's head honcho told Automotive News that should opportunities arise for ICE versions, ""we need to grab them or somebody else will."" Since the EV market seems to be cooling down, selling these two models with gas engines at a presumably lower price seems like a no-brainer. It would make sense especially considering the company’s new goal is to achieve one million annual sales in the United States.
Even with gas derivatives of the Wagoneer S and Recon, hitting 1M still seems like an overly ambitious goal at this point. Cheaper vehicles to indirectly replace the Renegade and Cherokee would help bolster volume. Europe's Jeep Avenger might be a solution in the US but it wasn't mentioned during the interview.
Meanwhile, the 600-horsepower Wagoneer S is scheduled to go on sale in the third quarter of the year for a short 2024MY run. With a 0 to 60 mph in less than three and a half seconds, it'll be Jeep quickest vehicle ever. It's getting about 400 miles of range and all-wheel drive with a dual-motor setup. The firm's boss says the large electric SUV can lure in Tesla buyers who ""want something more sophisticated.""
The smaller Recon is coming by year's end and will have its first full year on sale in 2025. Other than the STLA Large platform, technical specifications have not been disclosed, but it should be smaller than the Wagoneer S. Filosa projects Wrangler customers interested in electrified off-roaders will want the Recon.

The EV Industry Has A Battery Oversupply Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/716392/ev-industry-battery-oversuplly/,"That sounds bad, but it should result in cheaper batteries for everything from cars to stationary storage.",4/17/2024 12:00,"Last year, demand for lithium-ion batteries that went into electric vehicles and stationary storage amounted to roughly 950 gigawatt-hours globally, according to estimates from BloombergNEF. At the same time, the total battery manufacturing capacity was almost triple, at about 2,600 GWh.
At the end of next year, the total global announced battery manufacturing capacity is said to be 7,900 GWh or 7.9 terawatt-hours, while demand projections squeeze out a figure of 1.6 TWh, according to the same source. In other words, we’re looking at a supply chain that could churn out five times more lithium-ion batteries than needed for EVs and storage applications. So what now?
EV demand didn't quite keep up with supply
Battery makers around the world churned out about almost times more cells than were needed for EVs and stationary storage last year. That discrepancy is expected to get even bigger in the following years as battery companies continue to invest heavily in R&D.
Well, for starters, it’s worth noting that the announced battery manufacturing capacity will most likely never be reached. Bloomberg writes that much of it will be either behind schedule or canceled. That’s because some battery manufacturers will simply be squeezed out of business by the big players and other parts of the supply chain won’t be able to deliver at such a high pace.

However, the fact of the matter is that the world’s battery makers will continue to increase their production capacity as time goes on to keep up with the expected demand for EVs and stationary storage. This is because multiple nations across the world, including the United States and the European Union’s members, have imposed gradual carbon dioxide emission reductions for passenger cars, which can be reached by increasing the share of battery- or hydrogen-powered vehicles.
China is the global leader in battery manufacturing, whether we like it or not, and it will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Two of the world’s biggest players, CATL and BYD, continue to invest billions in research and development, coming up with new and better products.
Europe, North America and Asia (except China) are also set to increase their battery manufacturing capacity in the next two years.
Polestar 5 prototype battery module featuring StoreDot XFC cells
All of this might seem intimidating but it all boils down to the benefits for the end users. And the biggest benefit of them all is that the price of EV batteries will continue to go down, enabling carmakers to introduce more affordable cars.
Last year, the average price for lithium-ion battery packs went down 14% compared to 2022, reaching $141/kWh for the electric bus, commercial EV, passenger EV and stationary storage segments, according to BloombergNEF. In 2019, the average was $258/kWh.
By the end of 2024, China’s CATL expects to bring the cost of lithium-ion battery cells down to less than $60/kWh. That’s less than half of last year’s average.
China already has its fair share of cheap, no-frills EVs that can be had for the equivalent of $10,000 to $15,000. In the United States, we’re not quite there yet, but upcoming models like the entry-level Chevrolet Equinox EV, VinFast VF3 and Kia EV3 are sure to lower the entry point for EVs in America.

"Tesla Engineers, Technicians, Sales Staff, Recruiters Hit By Layoffs In U.S. And China",https://insideevs.com/news/716270/tesla-engineers-sales-staff-laid-off/,"Hundreds of job cuts have already taken place in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas.",4/16/2024 10:30,"It has been a tumultuous year for Tesla so far, and for Tesla, that's really saying something.
The world’s most highly valued car company and the largest battery electric vehicle manufacturer saw its sales plummet in the first quarter, followed by a major reshuffling of its future strategy. Plans for the affordable $25,000 EV have somewhat disappeared into oblivion, while a deeply unproven Robotaxi concept has reportedly captured CEO Elon Musk’s full attention.
Amidst this pandemonium, mass layoffs are currently underway at Tesla, coinciding with the departure of several top executives. When reports of job cuts surfaced yesterday, it was unclear which divisions would be affected. The automaker has Gigafactories in California, Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai, with planned projects in Mexico and potentially India.
After years of skyrocketing growth, Tesla is cooling down
Tesla has hit its first major roadblock after years of aggressive sales and financial growth. Its Q1 2024 sales plummeted, the affordable Model 2 is reportedly scrapped, and thousands of workers are being laid off. Will this just be a bad chapter in Tesla's story or something to truly worry about?
Documents seen by InsideEVs suggest that job cuts are affecting several roles. This includes project managers, automation engineers, ergonomics designers, and data analysts, among others.
The firing spans across the U.S.—the majority of that in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Several roles are being slashed in Dallas, New York, Toronto and Palo Alto as well. The document suggests job cuts of at least 140 people, mostly engineers.
On the other side of the planet, two sources Reuters spoke to said more than 10% of Tesla China’s sales team were losing their jobs, whereas a relatively small proportion of employees working at Gigafactory Shanghai, Tesla’s largest global manufacturing and export hub by volume, would be let go.
German media is reporting that 3,000 of Tesla Germany’s 12,000 workforce have been fired. Yet, some 686 Tesla job postings are open in Germany alone. Tesla Germany has refuted the German media reports. ""We will pursue the measure for Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg against the background of all labor law and co-determination requirements, bringing in the works council,"" a Tesla Germany official told Reuters.
Tesla’s global headcount is estimated to be somewhere around 140,000, according to Elektrek. A 10% reduction would mean a whopping 14,000 job cuts. So the layoffs could be underway for several more days. We’ll know its true impact in the next few weeks.
No other brand has electrified the auto industry in the same way as Tesla, especially in the U.S. After four years of aggressive growth, it’s hard to predict if this rough patch will be prolonged, or if the brand will bounce back in the next quarter.

"Maserati Ramps Up Its Electrification Plans, With One Big Caveat",https://insideevs.com/news/716170/maserati-folgore-day-announcement/,"Maserati has big plans to move on from screaming Ferrari V8 engines, while keeping sounds and rumbles for future EVs too.",4/15/2024 14:47,"The hot thing for automakers to do now is to hold an ""EV Day"" event to show off future electric plans, and despite being known for its ferocious internal combustion engines, even Maserati is no exception. And today during Maserati’s ""Folgore Day"" press conference in Italy, the automaker announced it was moving up the timeline on its all-electric future by two years, from 2030 to 2028.
Maserati’s lineup will include electric versions of all its vehicles by 2025, aiming to phase out its gas-powered cars before the end of 2028. (Folgore, which translates to lightning in Italian, is the brand’s nomenclature for its EV lineup.)
Maserati goes electric
The Italian brand is most famous for putting Ferrari engines into luxurious SUVs and sedans. Transitioning to an electric era without such an obvious character may prove more difficult for Maserati than others.
However, that statement comes with a significantly sized asterisk. Maserati CEO Davide Grasso told reporters at the Folgore Day press conference that different markets are adapting to electrification at different rates. In other words, all systems are go for an all-EV lineup, but the words “customer choice” were uttered several times, implying that it’s poised to pivot depending on which way the market swings.
That's in keeping with recent moves seen from other automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Ford, who have gotten somewhat skittish about the slowing rate of EV adoption despite the market being pushed heavily in that direction by emissions regulations. Still, in the meantime, the automaker is in the process of phasing out its trademark V8 along with the engine’s signature roar.
Maserati, like many luxury and supercar manufacturers, is dancing on a fine line.
Maserati launched its first all-electric vehicle, the 761-hp GranTurismo Folgore, in 2022. Following on its heels later today is the reveal of its droptop version, the GranCabrio Folgore, which Maserati calls the ""first"" luxury all-electric convertible on the market. That ignores the Tesla Roadster, but they must not count that as a luxury car.
The architecture it uses was designed to be modular so it can work for a gas-powered or electric motor with what Maserati calls “minimal adaptations.”  Employing three 300-kilowatt permanent magnet motors, the GranTurismo and GranCabrio include 800-volt technology for fast charging.
Like the newest Ram 1500 pickup truck in the Stellantis lineup, Maserati’s new EV is built with the Atlantis High electrical architecture, previously seen in the GranTurismo. Equipped with more advanced cyber-security and over-the-air update capabilities, the EV convertible also uses Maserati-designed software.
When it comes to the EV market, Maserati may not be the first brand that comes to mind.
What Maserati brings to the EV transition is couched in choice, which makes sense for this vintage Italian automaker. Known for putting Ferrari-sourced engines into four-door sedans, Maserati is a company known for what you hear behind the wheel. That may make it a tough sell for people who loved the idea of supercar-grade engines powering luxurious SUVs and family cars.
But its CEO sees things differently. “Electrification is an incredible opportunity,” Grasso said today.
The company has put some time, energy, and cash into sound effects for its EVs to bridge the gap. Working closely with Sonus Faber (Italian companies stick together) to create a bespoke 3D sound system that can be heard inside and out, the GranTurismo and GranCabrio will imitate its gas-powered predecessors’ rumble. A similar system will be heard on Stellantis cousin Dodge's new electric Charger as well.
South Florida is the seat of Maserati’s highest-earning dealerships, catering to a mostly-retired community with its luxury cars. It’s reasonable to believe that those buyers won’t make the jump to the Folgore lineup, but Grasso begs to differ.
“Modern luxury customers tend to be Alpha customers who move faster,” he said today, adding, “The roots of our brand builds our future.”
While Head of design Klaus Busse says the Trident represents a “don’t mess with me” message, but it’s “not in your face.” That tracks, as Maserati gives off a vibe of elegance versus its wilder countrymate Lamborghini, which drives like a cheetah pulling on a leash.
However, a new commercial for the Trident stars Damiano David, the lead singer of Gen Z-loving rock band Måneskin. It's quite a choice for the brand. The musician is most definitely in your face, etched with tattoos that cover his body, including his hands—all of which are visible in the commercial. David dates (as of last celebrity sightings) American actress Dove Cameron and walks with a swagger only an Italian Alpha male can convincingly pull off. He dresses and undresses, titillating in a way that Maserati hasn’t in the past.
The new ad is a little shocking in its brazen audacity; it’s clear that South Florida isn’t the targeted demographic for the future. It’s a smart move, too, because the next generation will determine the direction of automotive propulsion, design, and functionality. By focusing on the craftsmanship and performance of the Maserati legacy, the brand can make the switch to EVs as planned.
Today, however, Maserati is living in sin with electrification but hasn’t put a ring on it. As quickly as the market is shifting, it’s keeping its options open.

"China Paid Billions In Aid To Local EV Makers, Including Tesla, To Dominate The Market: Study",https://insideevs.com/news/716063/china-ev-subsidies-byd-tesla-billions-study/,"BYD was the biggest beneficiary of China’s support scheme, raking $3.7 billion in direct subsidies.",4/15/2024 14:00,"China spent billions of dollars to boost the competitiveness of its local electric vehicle industry, according to a new study published last week by Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy quoted by Bloomberg.
The think tank, which advises the German government, said that China’s aid to domestic new energy vehicles amounted to roughly $5.6 billion until 2022 when the direct payments to manufacturers were phased out. New energy vehicles (NEVs) include all-electric cars (EVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs).
How China boosted its EV game through direct subsidies
While most Western nations are trying to boost sales of battery-powered vehicles by essentially reducing the purchase price of a new car, China's approach has been to send the money directly to the automakers.
How much money? Roughly $5.6 billion until 2022, according to a new study from Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The biggest beneficiary of China’s support scheme was BYD, which received $3.7B in direct aid from 2018 to 2022. The lion’s share was awarded in 2022, with BYD getting $2.2B from the Chinese government.

Tesla, which competes directly with BYD both on the domestic market and on a global scale, was the second largest beneficiary of China’s support scheme in 2022. The American-based EV maker received about $426 million from the Chinese government for the cars it manufactured at its Shanghai facility.
China’s direct purchase subsidy scheme was axed at the end of 2022, according to the German think tank that published the study. The scheme awarded between $1,380 and $2,400 on average for each new energy vehicle manufactured in China between 2010 and 2022.
Compared to other countries that offer some sort of subsidy for the purchase of a new environmentally friendly vehicle, including the United States, the biggest difference in China was that the state gave the money to the car makers and not the buyer.
Even though this particular support scheme has been phased out, China’s battery electric vehicle buyers are exempt from paying a 10% purchase tax. In 2024 and 2025, the country will apply a complete purchase tax exemption for all NEVs, not just EVs, amounting to savings of about $4,200 on average per vehicle, according to the institute. This exemption will be halved in 2026 and 2027.
The think added that besides the direct subsidies applied until 2022, China’s EV industry also benefited from subsidized pricing on important materials such as steel and batteries, as well as discriminatory government procurement, both of which are hard to measure.
“The very comprehensive and opaque Chinese subsidy system blurs the difference between domestic subsidies which do not distort trade and subsidies intended to help domestic companies to conquer export markets and thus are trade distortive,” Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy said.
The figures put things in perspective after the European Commission officially launched an anti-subsidy investigation into the import of battery-powered vehicles from China in October 2023. The Commission argued that it found sufficient evidence demonstrating that EV imports from China benefit from subsidies that allow them to rapidly increase their market share in the European Union. This could ultimately threaten the Bloc’s domestic industry and demotivate investments, the Commission said.
If the European Commission’s investigation confirms these allegations, the EU could impose retroactive tariffs against battery-powered cars imported from China, a move that was not seen with too much enthusiasm by the Chinese government or some local German automakers last year.
The increasing dominance of China’s EV makers has also urged some American officials to speak out in favor of tariff spikes. Earlier this year, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley proposed legislation to hike the Chinese vehicle import total tariff to 125% from 27.5% currently. The bill also seeks to apply a 100% tariff increase to vehicles assembled in Mexico by Chinese-based automakers.",Iulian Dnistran
The U.S. Paid $580 Million In Point-Of-Sale EV Tax Credits So Far This Year,https://insideevs.com/news/716072/point-of-sale-ev-rebates-580-million-april-2024/,"The IRS received roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports since January 1.",4/15/2024 13:00,"The fact that buyers of new electric cars in the United States can benefit from the $7,500 tax credit at the point of sale seems to be a pretty big hit among customers.
According to the U.S. Treasury, the government reimbursed car dealers for more than $580 million in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments so far this year, with the Internal Revenue Service receiving roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports since January 1.
The point-of-sale EV tax credit is a pretty big hit, it seems
Wit roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so far this year, it seems that American EV shoppers are enjoying the fact that they can benefit from the EV tax credits at the point of sale.
Until the end of last year, people who were eligible for a new EV tax credit of up to $7,500 or the $4,000 used EV credit could benefit from them only when they filed their tax returns the next year.
More EV Tax Credit Stories
The rules changed at the beginning of 2024, however, allowing buyers to transfer the credits to a car dealer at the time of sale, which effectively lowers the purchase price of the car and eliminates the hassle of worrying about filing tax returns in the year following the purchase.
That said, customers need to attest they meet certain income limits to qualify for the tax credit when they buy the EV. Otherwise, they will need to repay the government when filing their taxes, so the worries aren’t completely gone–a little caution is needed, that’s all. For new EVs, the adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals.
“Demand is high four months into implementation of this new provision,” said Treasury spokesperson Haris Talwar last week.
Introduced in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the EV tax credits can be applied to eligible vehicles that are assembled in North America. At the beginning of 2024, the rules were changed to exclude battery-powered vehicles that include battery components from so-called “foreign entities of concern” (FEOC) like China, Iran and Russia.
When the changes went into effect, no fewer than 24 models were disqualified from receiving the $7,500 tax credit, leaving just 19 EVs on the list. Since then, some battery-powered cars, including the Volkswagen ID.4, Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadilac Lyriq have regained eligibility.",Iulian Dnistran
"Aston Martin Delays First EV, Will Sell PHEVs Into The 2030s",https://insideevs.com/news/715800/aston-martin-delays-first-ev/,This means power for future plug-in Astons will come from a combination of AMG V8 and its own V12 engines aided by electric motors.,4/11/2024 14:30,"Just as the electric vehicle market started showing signs of slowing down, several automakers, especially those with low-volume production and a high price point, have adjusted their stance on EVs. They have announced that they will keep producing cars with combustion engines for longer than previous estimates and that they don’t plan to stop until they are legally obligated to do so.
Aston Martin is the most recent automaker to make a similar announcement. Its official plan was to launch its first EV in 2025, but in February of this year, it announced that it had been pushed back to 2026. That made the company’s commitment to EVs not seem as strong as before, and it seems to be confirmed by a statement recently made by the company’s executive chairman, Lawrence Stroll.
Aston Martin fears that going electric will make its customers vanish
Low-volume, high-price point automakers like Aston Martin don't want to go electric fearing their very small customer base, which wants powerful and noisy combustion engines, will disappear if it goes all-in on EVs.
According to PistonHeads, the Aston Boss, referring to the brand’s first EV, said “We planned to launch the first car next year in 2025. We were ready to do so, but it seems there is a lot more hype in the EV market that was politically driven rather than by consumer demand. Particularly at an Aston Martin price point.”
He also confirmed that much of the development work on Aston’s bespoke EV platform was done and that the automaker intends to use it to underpin four different models: “a sports car, an SUV, a type of CUV and a halo hypercar. We have all those products designed and technically engineered, so that process is done.”
Stroll also noted that “We are going to invest much more heavily in our PHEV program to be a bridge between full combustion and full electric” because the brand’s customers want cars that make noise and have an exciting combustion-centric powertrain. He also announced that the Aston Martin EV would be pushed back by another year so it would arrive in 2027 and that more emphasis would be put on plug-in hybrids until then.
These future Aston PHEVs will feature both the AMG twin-turbo V8 as well as the brand’s own V12, so we can expect power outputs to reach close to 1,000 horsepower in the most potent models. These cars will be both front- and mid-engined, and there’s no reason for Aston to stop selling them until well into the mid-2030s or “for as long as we’re allowed to legally, we will keep making them. I believe there will always be a demand, although granted that demand will shrink,” according to Stroll.
The first series plug-in from Aston Martin is expected to be a PHEV version of the DBX, the brand's first SUV. It is currently available with the AMG-sourced twin-turbo V8, which makes 550 horsepower in the base version, but with the addition of an electric motor, it could make over 800 horsepower and provide a few dozen fully electric miles of range.

BMW And Rimac Sign Partnership For Next-Gen EV Battery Packs,https://insideevs.com/news/715502/bmw-rimac-ev-battery-partnership/,"Rimac has supplied its innovative EV tech to big automakers before, which in turn bought significant chunks of the company.",4/9/2024 12:30,"The Rimac Group is an automaker and automotive technology company based in Zagreb, Croatia, which is known for its 800-volt electric vehicle architecture that enables EVs to run more efficiently and charge very quickly. After entering important partnerships with Porsche and Hyundai, Rimac has just announced another venture with a big-name car brand, BMW. It also owns Bugatti now.
According to the official announcement, this is a long-term strategic commitment between BMW and Rimac Technology (the engineering arm of the company that supplies powertrains for third-party EVs) to “create innovative solutions for the high-voltage batteries in future selected vehicle projects.”
Rimac is known for its 800-volt architecture and the mighty Nevera
Rimac not only supplied the 800-volt technology used in Porsche and Hyundai-Kia EVs, but it also created the world's first electric hypercar, the monstrous Nevera with over 1,900 horsepower.
This sounds like BMW will not be directly supplied by Rimac, but it will use the latter’s know-how to develop its own next-gen EV batteries. Even though we know the upcoming range of Neue Klasse models will feature an 800-volt architecture, we doubt these new batteries developed with Rimac’s help will be what powers the new line of BMW EVs, the first of which should debut before the end of 2024.
At the end of its press release announcing the partnership, BMW makes it clear that its sixth-generation eDrive technology (that will power Neue Klasse models) was developed separately and without input from Rimac. However, that’s not to say Neue Klasse models can’t receive improved batteries co-engineered with Rimac as part of an update after they are launched.
BMW says it will “release more details about what form the strategic tie-up will take, as well as its scope and content, at a later stage.” The exact same phrase is used in the press release published by Rimac, which doesn’t reveal any additional information.
The founder and CEO of Rimac, Mate Rimac, notes that this important partnership with BMW is “a clear sign of the transition of Rimac Technology from niche high-performance supplier to high-volume production capability. With the relentless growth of our business, including the opening of Rimac Campus, we’re now ready to deliver large-scale projects for the leading brands in the automotive industry.”
But even if details are currently very limited, this collaboration is intriguing. Let’s not forget that Rimac makes the world’s quickest-accelerating road-legal car, the bonkers-quick Nevera, a vehicle that is quite similar in philosophy to what BMW would make were it to launch an electric hypercar. Rimac says this is “the largest and most ambitious project the company has undertaken to date,” and it’s already involved in some pretty big projects, so the BMW-Rimac partnership is definitely very exciting news.

"Polestar Doesn’t See Tesla As A Rival, Has Its Eye On Porsche Customers",https://insideevs.com/news/715351/polestar-rivals-porsche-luxury-brands/,"The Volvo spinoff brand wants to be measured against Porsche and other premium automakers, not Tesla.",4/8/2024 16:00,"Selling as many cars as possible is what the vast majority of automakers want, but not all of them are interested in huge volumes that would rival Tesla, which sold about 1.8 million cars globally in 2023. Polestar has models that directly rival Tesla’s, like the Polestar 2, which is an EV that the company admitted was going after Model 3 sales, but it wants to position itself as more premium and attract more “luxury” customers from established premium brands like Germany’s big three or Porsche.
Australia’s Drive talked to Graeme Lambert, who is Polestar’s global communications executive for Design, Innovation and APAC (Asia-Pacific), who explained Polestar’s different focus. He noted that Tesla was “chasing volume” and that it is “a mass-market player,” while explaining that Polestar is “a premium luxury brand with volume targets that are in line with that.”
Polestar wants Porsche buyers
Even though Polestar sells vehicles that are similar in size and scope to Teslas, its offerings are more expensive and the Volvo spinoff brand would like to woo buyers away from the likes of Porsche.
This is evident in Polestar’s much less ambitious annual sales target, which has been set at between 155,000 and 165,000 vehicles in 2025. That’s considerably less than Tesla, which is expected to sell around 2.2 million vehicles this year, even though in the year’s first quarter, it manufactured more cars than it could deliver and is now offering big discounts for those who accept buying from inventory.
Tesla is known for its unexpected and often significant discounts, and this is another part of its business model that Polestar couldn’t hope to match. Lambert mentioned one of Polestar’s new models, the Polestar 4, as being a direct rival for the Tesla Model Y, at least in terms of size and scope. However, he explains that Polestar is actually hoping it will attract Porsche Macan EV buyers, which is another EV similar in size to a Model Y, but a lot more expensive.
Even though Polestar started its existence as a sporty, electrified Volvo spinoff, the Swedish manufacturer announced that it had no plans to keep supporting Polestar financially. It is still owned by Volvo’s parent company, Geely, and it announced that it had secured part of the funding it needed to stay afloat. In the future, we are likely to see an even bigger divergence between the vehicles sold by Polestar and Volvo, although they will still share platforms and technology.
The Polestar 4 electric coupe-SUV starts at $56,300, but it can go up to $74,300 in dual-motor Performance spec. That makes it a bit more expensive than the Tesla Model Y, whose base variant costs $44,990, but it undercuts the Porsche Macan EV with its starting price of $78,800 (or $105,300 in Macan Turbo guise).
Polestar is also working on a rival for the Porsche Taycan, which will be called the Polestar 5, and it should enter production by the end of the year. It is expected to start at around $100,000 (just like the Taycan), offer almost 900 horsepower in top trim, and surpass 300 miles of EPA range with its 103-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It will also be a rival for the Model S, but Tesla’s big sedan is considerably cheaper, with a starting price of $76,630.

"Nissan To Slash EV Production Cost By 30%, Says U.S. CEO",https://insideevs.com/news/715075/nissan-30-percent-ev-cost-reduction/,The projected cost reduction seems to be in line with what other automakers are predicting for their next-gen EVs.,4/5/2024 13:00,"Nissan is a pioneer of electric vehicles, but it lost the early lead it achieved with its Leaf, and now it’s struggling to catch up to newer EV players such as Tesla or Hyundai-Kia. One way it plans to make its future EVs more popular is to sell them for less, and a company official recently announced that Nissan’s next-generation electric models will cost around 30% less to manufacture current EVs like the Leaf or the Ariya.
According to Jérémie Papin, Nissan's US CEO, quoted by Yahoo Finance, the automaker will achieve these cost savings through “simplification” and “greater commonality across many of the models.” This means there will not only be fewer components going into the construction of an electric vehicle but more of them will be shared with other models.
Nissan needs more and better EVs
Nissan's EVs aren't currently the most desirable, although sales of the Ariya are going up, and one way to make them more attractive to buyers is by making them cheaper to manufacture and then passing on the savings to the consumer.
Papin also expects electric and electrified vehicles to reach price parity with combustion cars by the decade's end. One way Nissan could achieve this would be by ditching its plans to go all-in on solid-state batteries by 2028. However, solid-state batteries are expensive and aren't expected to go down in price enough until the self-imposed deadline (unless there's a breakthrough) to allow the manufacturer to achieve the 30% savings by adopting this new battery tech—it may continue to research lithium-ion batteries to achieve the desired savings.
Nissan is not giving up on solid-state batteries, though, and it’s setting up a pilot production facility in Japan where it plans to start experimenting with manufacturing solid-state cells and packs. Even though solid-state batteries are still considerably more expensive, Nissan believes they are the key to bringing the price of EVs down. It aims to reduce the cost per kilowatt hour to $65 by 2028.
Of the 30 new models that Nissan plans to launch by 2026, 16 will be electrified, but it didn’t say how many would be pure EVs. It needs a broader swathe of BEV models if it has any chance of competing with rival manufacturers, and a range comprised of the Leaf and Ariya isn’t enough.
The Ariya saw a 44.8% US sales increase in Q1 2024, while sales of the Leaf went down by over 50% in the same quarter. Nissan is looking to launch an electric pickup truck in the US, which is expected to arrive around the end of the decade and be a collaborative effort with Mitsubishi. Honda is another potential partner to help Nissan make more EVs.

Polestar 7 To Succeed 2 In Brand’s Next-Generation EV Portfolio,https://insideevs.com/news/714997/polestar-7-to-replace-2-electric-sedan-in-2027/,CEO Thomas Ingenlath said he’s not inclined to follow a VW Golf-like evolution of the Polestar 2 nameplate.,4/4/2024 17:00,"The Polestar 2 has single-handedly led the charge in the Swedish automaker’s quest to offer cutting-edge and premium electric cars. Despite it being a great car, it’s not quite blown up the sales charts. Its 2023 global sales were up only 4% year-over-year with just over 53,000 units sold, and Q4 2023 sales were down by 43%. To fix this, Polestar will radically reinvent the EV when it reaches the end of its lifespan by 2027. And that reinvention starts with a new name: Polestar 7.
Polestar’s naming strategy seems muddled. The 2 is a sedan on stilts, 3 is the SUV, 4 is the coupe-style SUV, and the 5—if the brand survives till then in its current form—is expected to be something like the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. The 6 is a sportscar and the 7 will now circle back to the next-generation 2. Don’t worry if you have difficulty associating these numbers with the correct body style, even someone who writes about EVs daily has this issue.
Polestar Makes A Case For Itself
CEO Thomas Ingenlath is confident that the brand is all about exclusivity, performance and cutting-edge tech. But so are several others. At a time when the EV market is realigning towards affordability, Polestar would need some solid business strategy, and maybe some stroke of luck to sustain.
“As much as we might build a very similar car, because it has a different number we won’t have this natural trap where we’re boxed into that concept of what the car had been,” Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Autocar. “As nice as it is to have a ‘Golf’ category of car, it’s very limiting in terms of innovative power, because you’re always back in the box of what the ‘Golf’ should be,” Ingenlath added.
The report states that Polestar 7 would likely be underpinned by parent company Geely Group’s Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), or a new iteration of the same. The Polestar 4, Zeekr 001, and Volvo EX30 ride on this platform.
The broader EV industry is now realigning towards smaller and affordable EVs to attain profitability, but Polestar’s approach is the opposite. Ahead of the ongoing New York International Auto Show, Ingenlath chatted with InsideEVs about the Polestar 4, how the company aims to come out of its current financial and sales troubles, and its larger EV ambitions in the coming years.
“There’s only that much you can do with Polestar 2,” Ingenlath told InsideEVs. “But three cars in our range mean growing the company in terms of volume. The segments that these cars are in means revenue opportunity as well,” he added, referring to adding the Polestar 3 and 4 to its U.S. line-up this year. “You have to be clear about the nature of your company, and for us, it's the performance [focused] and premium exclusive segment.”
Dozens of new EVs will enter the market by 2027, so the Polestar 7 would have to be something truly radical to leave a mark.

Nissan And Mitsubishi Team Up For U.S.-Spec Electric Pickup Truck,https://insideevs.com/news/714510/nissan-mitsubishi-electric-pickup-phev/,"The deal will also result in a Nissan-badged plug-in hybrid, as well as an all-electric Mitsubishi.",4/1/2024 9:00,"Nissan and Mitsubishi struck a deal to develop several electrified vehicles specifically for the United States market in a bid to minimize development costs in a time when the growth of all-electric vehicles has slowed and major manufacturers are looking to plug-in hybrids as a stopgap until EVs regain momentum.
Currently, Mitsubishi doesn’t have any all-electric vehicles on sale in the U.S. and Nissan doesn’t have any plug-in hybrids. Moreover, neither companies offer a battery-powered pickup. But all of this is going to change in the coming years.
Japanese automakers form alliances to cut EV development costs
Nissan is teaming up with Mitsubishi to try and lower the development costs of future plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. The deal between the two Japanese automakers will reportedly produce at least three models, including an all-electric Mitsubishi, a plug-in hybrid Nissan, and a battery-powered mid-size pickup truck co-developed specifically for the U.S. market. Previously, Nissan signed a memorandum of understanding with Honda to explore how they can work on EV-specific tech together.
According to Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida, quoted by Automotive News, this first-ever cross-company collaboration between the two marques for the U.S. market will yield at least three distinct vehicles. The news comes after the reported talks between Nissan and Fisker were put to rest and after Nissan announced it would work together with Honda to develop EV-specific tech.
More Industry Stories
Nissan will use tech from Mitsubishi, which makes the Outlander PHEV, to launch a plug-in hybrid and Mitsubishi will launch a new car in the U.S. using Nissan’s EV technology, possibly the same used in the Ariya crossover.
A timeline for these launches hasn’t been provided, but during Nissan’s latest presentation, the Japanese company said it will launch 30 new models by fiscal year 2026, 16 of which will be electrified. Hence, we expect the two new models from Nissan and Mitsubishi to hit the streets in the next two years.
An all-electric 1-ton pickup truck will also be co-developed by the two Nippon automakers and will probably result in two different models. Automotive News speculated that this new EV, which is bound to debut sometime between 2027 and 2031, will likely be a successor to the combustion-powered Nissan Frontier.
2022 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X
2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV
2024 Nissan Ariya
The battery-powered mid-size pickup will reportedly be manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States and Latin America to circumvent import tariffs that are faced by models brought in from overseas. The source also writes that a plug-in hybrid version of the future pickup is also under consideration.
""In North America, we will receive a supply of vehicles from our alliance partners to a certain extent. We will receive what is necessary [for] our overall product lineup,"" Mitsubishi Vice President Hiroshi Nagaoka said back in February. ""In the electrification shift, new cars will become necessary. So we are discussing with our partners.""
It’s unclear at this point if the EV, PHEV, and electric pickup will be badge engineering jobs or distinct models from Nissan and Mitsubishi. Using tech from an alliance partner is a quick and relatively inexpensive way for an automaker to reach its fleet emissions goals, but simply sticking another badge on an existing car has been known to dilute the name of the company in the customer’s eyes.
It’s too soon to tell how this partnership will stack up, so we’ll just have to wait and see what happens. In the meantime, you can hit the comments below to tell us what you think about this.",Iulian Dnistran
"Polestar CEO: 'Crucial' Year Ahead With New SUVs, No Plans For Cheaper EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/714379/polestar-ceo-nyas-interview/,"Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath tells InsideEVs about differentiating from Volvo, parent Geely's commitment and being profitable by 2025.",3/29/2024 16:48,"Thomas Ingenlath clearly doesn't think the Polestar 2 has gotten its due.
""Polestar was a one-car company in 2023,"" the brand's CEO told InsideEVs at the New York Auto Show this week. ""The big burden was on the shoulders of the Polestar 2.""
Still, he said, ""Polestar delivered 54,000 cars [globally] in 2023. That is something that puts us ahead of a lot of EV competitors. Our business will grow this year... that's [going to be] a rare thing in 2024.""
Polestar's challenges lie ahead
2024 is indeed a critical year for Polestar, an EV performance brand spun off from Volvo that has yet to become a household name. With two new electric SUVs coming soon, it hopes it can achieve mass-volume success and convince investors of its viability.
The drivers of that growth are expected to be the two crossovers that were parked on stage behind Ingenlath when we spoke: the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4. And it's hard to overstate how important both EVs will be to Polestar's long-term viability.
Even if the Polestar 2—a sedan doing battle in an SUV world—managed more deliveries than Lucid or Rivian in 2023, the company still dealt with tremendous headwinds last year and the first part of this one. It had to delay, for the second time, the Polestar 3 flagship crossover due to software issues that also impacted its corporate cousin Volvo. Rental car giant Hertz backed off a big plan to purchase 65,000 Polestar 2s after getting hammered by Tesla repair costs and dropping resale values. Its stock price hit the skids, so much so that Volvo cut its investment in the brand. Analysts, and the financial press, still don't think very highly of its current state.
While it's Ingenlath's job to be optimistic, in New York he seemed more relieved than anything. The Polestar 3 is due out this summer with a starting price of $73,400. The Polestar 4 starts at $54,900. The order books open in late April, and deliveries are planned for the fourth quarter. Both cars, which should reach far more family buyers than the compact Polestar 2 sedan, should help the brand's dreams for critical mass.
Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath and Polestar Precept Concept
""In order to get to [that] model lineup, in 25 countries where we do business, people forget how long it took Tesla to actually get there,"" Ingenlath said. ""It was a decade before they actually got noticed. As a new brand in the EV sector, you actually have to come to the table a bit faster.""
But critical mass doesn't mean mass appeal, Ingenlath said. There are no plans for cheaper models in the Polestar portfolio, or ones that go below the Polestar 2 in price.
""The portfolio that we have starts at the Polestar 2 price level and it goes all the way up to you know where 5 and 6 will be,"" he said, referring to an upcoming sedan and sports car. ""The mass market is not our market.""
He added, ""If you go there, fine, but it's a completely different game. You have to be clear about the nature of your company. And for us, it's that premium, exclusive, performance segment.""
Ingenlath is very clear that he envisions Polestar as a performance brand, specifically calling out BMW's M division and Porsche. That's especially tough competition, particularly as both German automakers are doing surprisingly well in the EV game right now.
But Ingenlath said that's a key part of how Polestar differentiates itself from Volvo, with which it shares some manufacturing facilities, technology and components. And he says the brand can pull it off.
""The Polestar 3's [center of gravity] is as low as a Polestar 1,"" he said, referring to the brand's original grand tourer hybrid coupe. ""Scandinavian design, but much more techy, much more driver-oriented, much more on the performance side. Very different from where the core brand values of Volvo are.""
Telling the two brands apart can be a challenge, and even people inside both Scandinavian car companies don't always have a great answer to where one begins and the other ends.
But Ingenlath said that the parent company of both, Chinese conglomerate Geely, is sticking with the two brands in North America long term. Some skeptics have wondered if that was still the case, considering the U.S. tour that just happened with another Geely brand, Zeekr.
""I have the certainty that Geely is very committed to the Polestar brand,"" Ingenlath said, likening it to Volkswagen operating similar divisions like SEAT and Skoda in Europe.
Still, Polestar is developing workarounds for the increasing political tensions between the U.S. and China that may lead to stricter tariffs on those cars, even ones made in Mexico. The Polestar 2 is built in China, but the Polestar 3 will be built in South Carolina soon and the Polestar 4 will be made in South Korea. It's why Ingenlath said he's less than worried about political headwinds in the U.S. that may not favor EVs after the November election.
""This is about jobs in the U.S. that we provide, and I think that's something that any politician should keep in mind,"" he said.

"Hyundai Ioniq 5 And 6 Are Profitable; Company 'Studying' Range Extenders, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/714104/hyundai-range-extender-interview/,"Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor America's CEO, says the Korean automaker wants to offer options but is ""all-in on EVs.""",3/27/2024 15:00,"Suppose you happen to be the sort of person who worries about Hyundai's profit margins when you can't sleep at night. In that case, the automaker's American CEO doesn't want you to be too concerned about the bottom line when you see aggressive zero-down, $239-a-month lease deals on the electric Ioniq 6 sedan.
""We don't sell cars that are not profitable,"" Hyundai Motor America's CEO Randy Parker told InsideEVs in a wide-ranging interview today at the New York Auto Show. ""That's a big strategy strategy of ours. We don't sell cars at losses.""
Hyundai's EV push is working
While other automakers have demurred on EV plans somewhat after a few quarters of slowing growth, Korea's Hyundai, Kia and Genesis have not been among them. The company has a huge array of gas-powered cars but plans to roll out several new EV models in the next few years.
It's a fair question to ask, given how many automakers are losing money on EVs, especially ones sold at more mainstream, below-luxury prices. Parker's answer is especially interesting considering the lease price of a base Ioniq 6 SE—at least until the start of April—makes it about the cheapest new vehicle to lease in the U.S. But it works, Parker said, because both the Ioniq 6 and Ioniq 5 models are profitable.
""The market has gotten a lot tougher in 2024,"" Parker said, alluding to the rate of EV adoption proving to be slower than many automakers initially expected. ""Our deals are basically a consequence of just being competitive in the marketplace. We know we've got a great product. But we also know that consumers are looking for affordability, especially when it comes to EVs.""
Parker added, ""We came up with this lease to ensure we didn't lose our sales momentum.""
That does seem to be working well for the Hyundai Motor Group in the U.S. Including its Kia sibling and Genesis luxury division, the conglomerate sold more EVs in the U.S. last year than General Motors or Ford, and that was before the Kia EV9 even hit its sales stride. Additionally, Hyundai's larger three-row SUV, the Hyundai Ioniq 7—or Ioniq 9, depending on who you ask—is also set to debut this year. (Parker declined to comment on the car's anticipated name change.)
""We're keeping everything within our budget,"" Parker said of Hyundai's lease deals. ""I've got a very tough boss and he's not gonna let me get outside of my incentive budget, but for now, it's working for us.""
It's also working because Hyundai's EVs—all of which are built in Korea at the moment—do not qualify for any EV tax credit, which remains a kind of sticking point for the company. According to Parker's own boss, the Korean automaker got assurances their cars would qualify from the Biden Administration, only for that to not end up being the case. Instead, Hyundai has benefitted from the $7,500 tax credit being applied to leases, and the company's dealers also offer the same as a cash incentive.
That will change as Hyundai opens its new ""Metaplant"" in Georgia in the fourth quarter of this year. While Parker demurred when asked what EV (or EVs) that plant will build, he said those cars will qualify for tax incentives when they come off the line. And they can't come soon enough, he said.
""One of the things that's holding me back right now is capacity,"" Parker said. ""It's the only way we can grow."" Parker added that a program to sell Hyundai's cars via Amazon, then check out with financing and delivery via a local dealer, will be open to more customers in ""late summer.""
The New York Auto Show saw Hyundai's EVs win a number of awards, but this year, the cars that made their debut were gas-powered: the updated Hyundai Tucson SUV and Santa Cruz truck. More hybrids are coming to the portfolio as well.
But when asked if Hyundai had any plans for range-extended EVs—cars built from the ground up to be electric vehicles, but that also carry some kind of internal combustion engine to serve as a generator—Parker said those may be in the cards.
""I can't release any details, but most definitely,"" he said. ""We're studying this as we speak.""
A number of competitors are eyeing range-extended EVs as future options; a few examples include the new Ram 1500 Ramcharger and the upcoming Mercedes CLA-Class, not to mention the old BMW i3. In theory, this will allow automakers to keep building EV platforms but also offer customers options for fueling to help with range concerns.
But Parker said he's confident about where things are going.
""I want to make that very clear, we're all in when it comes to EVs,"" he said, adding that Hyundai has the flexibility to make more hybrids if demand skews that way.
""Hybrids, you know, they're fine,"" he said. ""It's a good transition for a lot of people. But if you really want to become carbon neutral, it's got to be done through EVs.""

"Thank Toyota's Lobbying For The New, Looser EPA Emissions Rules",https://insideevs.com/news/714024/toyota-lobbying-critical-materials/,"Meanwhile, Hyundai plans a $51 billion new investment into EVs, and we look at Nissan's plans for them as well.",3/27/2024 10:30,"Toyota is a hard company to figure out. It's generally accepted to be a latecomer to electric vehicles and EV technology, but it repeatedly assures its customers that it has big plans for battery-powered cars. Then again, it still isn't giving up that ill-fated hydrogen push, it doesn't really seem to want hybrids to go anywhere in the long-term, and when we look at its lobbying efforts, we find a concerted effort against EVs. What gives, right?
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials as some of us, your humble author included, make our way to the New York Auto Show. Also on tap for today: Hyundai makes clear it has no plans to back off on the EV front, and we take a closer look at what Nissan's future efforts mean for the U.S. market.
The new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel economy and emissions rules are the strictest ones the U.S. market has ever seen, and set the country on a path to a future that mostly runs on electric cars. But they aren't as tough as the ones that were initially proposed. Some say that's a realistic approach, given prices, range concerns and charging availability; others say the climate emergency demands faster action.
But the new rules do favor hybrids, and you can thank Toyota's lobbying for that, the New York Times' Hiroko Tabuchi reports:
Speaking [at a dealer breakfast in 2023] was Stephen Ciccone, Toyota’s top lobbyist. He said the industry was facing an existential crisis — not because of the economy or fuel prices, but because of stronger tailpipe pollution limits being proposed in the United States. The rules were “bad for the country, bad for the consumer, and bad for the auto industry,” he said, according to a memo he later circulated among Toyota dealerships that was reviewed by The New York Times.
“For more than two years, Toyota and our dealer partners have stood alone in the fight against unrealistic BEV mandates,” he wrote, using the acronym for battery-electric vehicles. “We have taken a lot of hits from environmental activists, the media, and some politicians. But we have not — and we will not — back down.”
[The new EPA rules] relaxed major elements of an earlier, more stringent proposal. In particular, the final regulations were favorable to hybrid cars, those that run both on gasoline and electricity — giving a bigger role to a market that Toyota dominates.
Toyota, it appeared, had come out on top.
Pretty much all the automakers had objections to the proposed EPA rules, even the ones who have substantial and public EV plans. But Toyota took a different approach:
Toyota said that it had steadily called on the E.P.A. to provide greater flexibility to meet the regulations. And it said its argument had prevailed, noting that several companies have recently announced plans to offer more hybrids rather than electric cars. “It appears that the industry has moved toward the position Toyota has consistently held,” it said.
The Times also reports that Toyota's efforts had a big impact on getting dealers to push back publicly on EVs, despite them being the fastest-growing new car segment.
In a statement to the Times, Toyota said the best way to reduce emissions ""is to give consumers a variety of choices to meet their needs."" And it's true that replacing purely gas cars with more hybrids—as Toyota's whole lineup seems poised to go—is a vastly better option than the alternative. But it's clear that when Toyota talks about winning, it means winning with its technology. And that's probably not going to go over great with longtime fans who want to move into a Toyota-made EV.
There are always two ways (at least) to look at the EV transition. One is that it can't happen fast enough for climate reasons; the other is that automakers are still for-profit entities who need to keep those profits going until they can scale up to what's inevitably coming, and that timing is hard to get right. The two goals are not in sync, because capitalism probably can't fix climate change, but here we are.
Anyway, the Hyundai Motor Group continues to roll out some new gas-powered cars and more hybrids, some of which we will see at the New York Auto Show this week. But it's also continuing to make huge, undaunted investments into EVs, as Reuters reports today:
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday it will invest 68 trillion won ($51 billion) over three years to bolster its growth potential in electric vehicles and new mobility business and separately hire 80,000 new employees.
More than half of the investment, or 35.5 trillion won, will be allocated for new research and development infrastructure and assembly lines for electric vehicles, the group said in a statement.
Another 31.1 trillion won will be slated for research and development in electric vehicles, including software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and battery technology, it said.
Across its three brands, the Hyundai Motor Group sold more EVs in 2023 than Ford or General Motors in the U.S. Clearly, it's doing something right there.
Earlier this week, Nissan released more details on The Arc, the name for its interim strategy to get from where it is now—sagging profits, falling sales and still feeling battered by a scandal in its top ranks—and a long-term plan for the 2030s and beyond. Here's Automotive News today diving deeper, including into what this all means for the U.S.:
Nissan is preparing three new batteries for electrified vehicles: a next-generation nickel-cobalt-manganese lithium-ion battery; a lithium iron-phosphate battery; and a solid-state battery.
To supply them, the carmaker plans to secure 60 gigawatt hours of additional capacity in the U.S. through the end of the decade. This will help the carmaker's EVs meet local procurement requirements for government incentives.
Executives say 60 gigawatt hours is enough to supply about 600,000 EVs. It is part of a wider campaign to add 135 gigawatt hours of battery capacity globally through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031.
And also:
Nissan's assembly plant in Canton, Miss., will get an update in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027, and its Smyrna, Tenn., assembly plant will be revamped by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2029.
Meanwhile, Canton and the Decherd, Tenn., powertrain factory will be overhauled for EV production in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027. Modular manufacturing will achieve a 20 percent reduction in per-vehicle production time.
So what Nissan is selling is a pretty hardcore acceleration of its entire business, including and especially on the EV front, to get ready for the end of this decade. But is Nissan up for this? It'd be an epic comeback story if it can pull this off, but that all remains to be seen.
I don't doubt the company is serious about future EV development so it doesn't get left behind long-term by new players from China, Korea and even Tesla. But how do you see this current strategy working out for them over the next few years, then into the 2030s and beyond?

The document did not offer further details, except to say that Fisker ""continues to evaluate strategic alternatives"" that may include restructurings, additional capital, debt refinancing or some other means to stay afloat. The news was first reported by TechCrunch today.
Fisker's startup challenges
The Fisker Ocean boasts an impressive and fresh design, but many reviewers have said it feels like an unfinished product. The company has struggled to deliver cars to customers and drum up new demand, and its finances now hang in the balance.
Though it was never officially confirmed by either automaker, the ""large automaker"" partner was widely reported to be Nissan. According to an earlier report from Reuters, Nissan was said to be interested in the Fisker Alaska concept as it seeks to break into the electric pickup truck market. Doing so would've given Fisker a much-needed financial lifeline. That story claimed more than $400 million would've gone to make the truck at one of Fisker's U.S. plants, with Nissan getting its own version of the vehicle.
But as InsideEVs also reported, the benefit to Nissan was far less obvious. Fisker's ""asset-light"" business model means it contracts out with external partners to make its cars, like Austria's Magna Steyr, which builds the Ocean crossover. That car uses a Fisker-owned version of Magna's EV platform and the company buys CATL batteries, so it was tougher to see what unique setup Nissan was ""getting"" from such a deal.
A Fisker spokesperson told InsideEVs the company has no comment beyond the filing. The company halted trading after the news broke today, and it halted production on new vehicles earlier this month.
Today's news is another unfortunate development for Fisker, which in recent months has struggled with deliveries and high-profile quality issues, including one especially scathing high-profile YouTube review.
While many Ocean owners who spoke to InsideEVs said they loved the cars aside from the bugs, the company's future feels more in doubt than ever after today's news. One analyst had grim things to say to Reuters today: ""I can't put it if it is next week or next year, but it is inevitable,"" Thomas Hayes, Chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital, said when asked about the possibility of Fisker filing for bankruptcy protection.",Patrick George
"Why Car Companies May Lose $6,000 On Each EV Sold For $50,000",https://insideevs.com/news/713577/ev-50k-losses-bcg-study/,A new Boston Consulting Group report outlines the challenges automakers face as they scale up EV production.,3/25/2024 13:59,"For automakers small and large, old and new, transitioning to a mostly electric future has not been an easy endeavor. Or a cheap one.
With the established ""legacy"" car companies, this has meant ramping up battery and software operations—and learning to make EVs correctly—while keeping profits up by selling gas-powered cars. For the startups, it has meant scaling up production systems for years, typically by selling more expensive EVs first, while trying to survive long enough to even become profitable.
Regulations, Climate And Profits Make A Complicated Mix
Automakers are being pushed toward a mostly zero-emission future by tough new climate regulations across the world. But pivoting their businesses to EVs is tough while being under pressure from investors to keep profits up.
So just how much money are car companies losing on EVs right now? According to one estimate from Boston Consulting Group, as much as $6,000 per EV sold around $50,000.
That data comes to us from BCG's new study, ""Can OEMs Catch the Next Wave of EV Adopters?"" which we also covered here.
""We estimate that most [automakers] currently lose around $6,000 on each EV they effectively sell for $50,000, after accounting for customer tax credits,"" the study said. ""We also estimate that [automakers] will only be able to close half of this cost gap by making the right technology choices; economies of scale as automakers ramp up production will help, too, but they won’t make up the difference.""
I was struck by the specificity of that figure, so I reached out to Andrew Loh, Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG and an author of the study, to learn more.
Here's how they landed on that $6,000 number.
""Take a $60,000 ICE vehicle,"" Loh said. ""A reasonable level of profitability that we've seen historically from ICE vehicles is about 10%,"" he said, stressing that vehicle profit margins exist over a broad range but that number is generally true of mass-market automakers with a strong presence in the U.S.
""Creating the bridge from ICE to EV, you need to add the cost of the battery, which is about $10,000,"" Loh said. ""You add the e-powertrain and incremental electronics, which is about another $5,000. And then you need to add the incremental investment and labor and overhead,"" which tends to be higher because few EV operations exist at scale right now.
Add about another $1,500 per vehicle for plant investments, engineering and other capital costs. Now subtract the ICE powertrain, which Loh said is around $4,000 per vehicle. ""That's what gets you to minus 10% [profits], or minus $6,000, as opposed to plus $6,000 profitability.""
In other words, it just comes down to high capital costs right now in the early stages of EV development, being built at operations that aren't yet fully at scale.
There are obvious exceptions to this, of course. Tesla has been solidly profitable for years, again owing to its manufacturing scale; stable profits were regular especially once it got its Chinese factory rolling. China's BYD is also profitable from making EVs. And luxury automakers in the U.S. are profitable with them too, because they can be sold at much higher prices; BMW, Porsche and Audi are just a few examples.
Again, the startups have this problem too, but in a different way. New operations like Lucid, Fisker and Rivian are believed to lose money on each car until they can cross the so-called ""Valley of Death"" and reach mainstream, volume sales.
So BCG's $6,000 number isn't a hard and fast rule for every brand or price point, but a general example of what's at stake for cars sold for around $50,000—still close to the average new car price in America.
But Loh and the other study authors note that unless automakers make a bigger retreat from EVs, this is a sort of temporary situation. New battery and carmaking plants are being built all of the time in the U.S. alone; new manufacturing techniques and battery chemistries are being developed to raise range while lowering costs; and nearly every automaker is finding ways to get into the cheaper $25,000 range, while still being profitable with them.
He just warned that the ultimate goal of ""profitable, at scale, EV production"" may be further off than some experts think.
""A lot of people have focused in on the cautionary tone of the [report,] and we certainly want to be balanced,"" Loh said. ""We, as a firm, continue to be optimistic about EVs over the long run. The word of caution was more around, if you expect [this new generation of EVs], to all of a sudden, reverse the fortunes, we're not sure that's going to happen completely.""

What The 2024 Election Could Mean For EV Tax Credits,https://insideevs.com/news/713548/election-2024-ev-tax-credit/,Campaign rhetoric points to an uncertain future for EV incentives if Republicans win big this fall.,3/25/2024 10:30,"Almost since the beginning of the modern hybrid and electric vehicle movement, the United States government has offered tax incentives for drivers who were willing to take a risk on—and usually pay a premium for—a new automotive technology. In 2002, two years after the Toyota Prius first hit dealer lots in the US and four years before Tesla would show off a 250-mile EV, the federal government launched its first incentives for the purchase of new hybrid vehicles.
Tax credits for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles have been a fixture of the American car buying experience ever since, and research shows they’ve been effective at encouraging the adoption of EVs and hybrids in the United States.
But with EVs serving as one of the many shibboleths in a terminally partisan culture, is the EV tax credit at stake in the coming November election? Considering that the current iteration of the EV tax credit has already been the subject of repeal threats from both sitting members of Congress and presidential hopefuls, that may well be the case.
Automakers and certain regulators are indeed finding ways to ""future-proof"" any major changes to what's trending to be a mostly electric future.
Recently, Stellantis signed a pact with several other automakers to follow California's stricter emissions rules, and new EV and battery factories in the Red State south—which are bringing tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs—are unlikely to go anywhere.
But the EV tax credits themselves may be another story.
The current iteration of the EV tax credit is one of the jewels of President Joe Biden’s crowning legislative achievement, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). When it became law in 2022, the IRA revamped what had previously been a fairly straightforward tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new EV, though manufacturers “ran out” after selling a certain amount of them. The new system progressively limited eligibility for the full credit depending on the origin of battery components and minerals, among other factors.
But it became immediately controversial on the other side of the aisle. For example, freshman Ohio senator J.D. Vance introduced a bill last September that would repeal the IRA’s EV tax credits and establish a $2,500 credit for the purchase of new vehicles manufactured in the United States. In November, now-former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley indicated a plan to repeal all of the IRA’s green energy incentives, the EV credit among them. And the mineral-specific rules have been a repeated target of Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative-leaning West Virginia Democrat who’s retiring from Congress but whose swing-vote power had a tremendous impact on the IRA.
By far the most high-profile critic of pro-EV policies, however,  has been former President Donald Trump, who now has the Republican nomination locked up.
Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would seek to repeal tax incentives for EVs in a second term. He has also said that EVs “don’t go far” and are “too expensive,” that EV incentives are “a hit job” on the Rust Belt’s manufacturing economy and that investing in them will somehow leave America in thrall to China.
With months to go before the polls open, votes can still be influenced by countless factors large and small including, perhaps, an interest in preserving access to EV tax credits. But from today’s vantage point, it seems at least plausible that at least one of the major seats of federal legislative power could change hands. Depending on which way the vote swings and how much, the seats of power could soon be filled by people who are ready and willing to end tax incentives for electric or alternative fuel vehicles.
If Biden is re-elected, all signs point to continued investment in EV infrastructure and at least four more years for the IRA’s EV tax incentives, which are currently set to sunset in 2032. If both houses of Congress and the presidency are controlled by Republicans next January, the party could look to unwind President Biden’s legislative agenda.
But Mike Murphy, a GOP political consultant and founder of the EV Politics Project, says that even then, repeal of the Biden administration’s EV policies is not a mortal lock. “You hear a lot of rhetoric” about repealing EV tax credits and manufacturing incentives, Murphy said, “but whether the votes are really there? It’s easier to say it on the campaign trail than to get it done.”
Murphy would expect pushback from the business community and from governors whose states have seen investments in EV and battery manufacturing, including key battleground states such as Georgia, Ohio, and Tennessee.
If a Trump presidency coincides with a Democrat-majority congress, the executive branch could still hack away at the EV tax credits by using the federal rule-making process to change how and where the credits can be applied, though Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, notes that any such changes would be subject to legal challenge.
Gore also says that the current implementation and rulemaking around these tax credits was “done with that in mind—that everything needs to be iron-clad and defensible, because we want these policies to be durable.”
EV tax credits have certainly been durable so far. They have persisted and evolved over the course of the last two decades, and there are policy arguments in favor on both sides of the political aisle.
The original 2002 tax credit for new hybrid vehicles was born during the George W. Bush administration and was designed, at least in part, to encourage people to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles at a time when the United States was recovering from what turned out to be the first pangs of a major energy crisis—not to mention, a post-9/11 renewed interest in American energy independence. They survived into the Obama years, but most of the tax credits expired after a certain number of vehicles were sold, so automakers like Tesla and General Motors ran out eventually.
The current EV tax credits were designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and reduce America’s dependence on energy from prickly trade partners including China and Russia. Leaders from both major political parties have historically backed policies that encourage energy independence, including drilling for domestic oil, subsidizing renewable energy, and encouraging individuals and businesses to reduce their emissions.
Electric vehicles are also key to automakers’ abilities to meet rising corporate average fuel economy standards, and crucial to reducing carbon emissions long-term. That’s where things start to turn contentious for EVs and, by extension, EV tax credits. Climate change and the attempts to mitigate it have become partisan issues for many in the United States. A Pew Research Center report released last summer found that 78 percent of Democrats consider climate change a major threat, compared to only 23 percent of Republicans. A 2023 Gallup survey found a less extreme but still pronounced party split on EVs, with 54% of Democrats saying they were actively considering purchasing an EV while more than 70% of surveyed Republicans said they never would.
Research has shown that EV ownership is a kind of conspicuous consumption—or as critics might call it, “virtue signaling”—for Democrats, who may feel more social or self-imposed pressure to reduce their personal emissions in a visible way. But the same messaging that tells Democrats that buying an EV is a good thing for the climate may be driving would-be Republican buyers away. Murphy says that the focus on EVs’ impact on the environment, which remains a partisan issue in the US, means that owning an EV is perceived as a political statement, that ""polarizes a significant part of the market” away from EV ownership.
Location demographics may play a role, too, as Democrats tend to be concentrated in cities (where car trips are shorter and less frequent) while Republican voters are more likely to live in rural areas where EV infrastructure is less available. Murphy thinks those motives could change with more new offerings like the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which will come with a range-extender gas engine to complement its electric battery.
For those of us who are paying close attention to the tax credit, history may offer clues to its fate.
In 2017, a Republican plan to overhaul the federal tax code proposed an end to the $7,500 tax credit. The tax plan eventually passed without changes to the incentive. In 2019, then-President Trump proposed a budget that would have eliminated the credit, claiming that doing so would save the federal government $2.5 billion over 10 years. Once again, the credits were safe by the time the budget was passed in August.
During one round of budget negotiations last summer, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives passed a bill that would have repealed certain provisions of the IRA mostly related to renewable energy, though that bill died in the Democrat-majority Senate.
An earlier version of the bill would have repealed even more of the IRA’s spending and incentives, including those for alternative fuel vehicles, but that proposal had been amended by the time votes were cast.
This pattern suggests that while the EV tax credit is a regular target in the federal budget-setting process, it has so far been more a bargaining chip than a sacrificial lamb. Democrats are willing to fight to preserve the credits, while Republicans seem content to let them skate by, even after making a big, public show about ending them.
The fate of the credit will depend not only on who sits in the Oval Office, but on which parties control the House and Senate (and by how much). Anyone predicting who will win those elections today is about as informed as a Magic 8 ball.
The EV tax credit has so far survived with both Republicans and Democrats in the White House, and it was even spared from the chopping block during the period from 2017-2019 when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency. But past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, and an increasingly vitriolic partisan environment could put even relatively benign policies in danger of spiteful repeal.
Still, Trump’s own campaign rhetoric points to support for the goals that underpin these tax credits. During a recent speech in Ohio, the former president railed against the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico and China, and said he would put a 100% tariff on Chinese vehicles manufactured abroad during a second term.
ZETA’s Gore says this bipartisan consensus on energy independence is part of what makes the EV tax credits so strong. “There is an emerging understanding that these credits all work together,” he says, referring to policies that encourage American control of “upstream” elements such as mineral and battery manufacturing and the “downstream” consumer-focused EV credits. “It doesn’t really work to try to lop off the one credit that you don’t like, when the upstream credit that you do like depends on this downstream policy.”

Only The Hyundai Ioniq 6 Has Everything 'Next-Wave' EV Buyers Want: Study,https://insideevs.com/news/713576/ioniq-6-boston-consulting-study/,How do EVs get past early adopters and break into the mainstream? Hyundai's Ioniq 6 may offer some clues.,3/25/2024 9:00,"Perception is reality, as they say. In the automotive world, that's never been more true than it is for electric vehicles. While the EV market has grown considerably over the past few years and countless great options are available at many (but certainly not all) price points, many prospective American electric buyers believe there aren't enough options yet that meet all of their needs.
Save for one, right now: the Hyundai Ioniq 6. Give Hyundai's electric ""streamliner"" its flowers, because it may be the spec king of the moment.
The next wave of EV adoption
Nearly all automakers concede the future of cars is electric. But by when, and how? Amid a slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, automakers are figuring out how to roll out new electric models at the right prices while staying profitable with their current portfolios.
That's part of the findings in a new study from the Boston Consulting Group, ""Can OEMs Catch the Next Wave of EV Adopters?"", which was published last week. The firm surveyed 3,000 consumers to figure out what it would take for EVs to break into the mainstream—past the first- and second-wave adopters who have broken up with gasoline over the past decade and change.
The study's authors don't mince words about the challenge of perception vs. reality.
""A narrative has emerged lately that US demand for electric vehicles has hit a wall,"" the study said. ""In reality, EV sales grew 50% in 2023; the problem was that the industry had forecast 70% growth. As a result, inventory piled up and a 'price war' ensued that dominated headlines.""
All of that is true; 2023 was a record year for EV sales in America, and 2024 is expected to see even higher numbers, but at a slower rate of growth than auto executives predicted. (In 2023, electric vehicles made up 7.6% of the U.S. vehicle market, up from 5.9% in 2022.)
""I think what [automakers] were probably doing was taking the historical sales, because things really started to accelerate from 2018 forward into 2022 and 2023,"" Andrew Loh, Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG, and an author of the study, told InsideEVs in an interview. ""You saw them nearly doubling. It's not like they completely fell off a cliff. It just was lower than expected.""
The study said that slashed production targets, delayed product launches, concerns over resale value, continued charging frustrations and weather concerns have all contributed to a sense of short-term pessimism in the EV market.
But after surveying those consumers and asking them what it would take to go electric, BCG's report said some big jumps in range and charging times—and cheaper pricing—are needed for further adoption. None of that is surprising, but some of their exact requirements might be.
""To convert the next wave of adopters into buyers, OEMs must address these key median requirements: 20-minute charging times; 30-minute detour and wait times for fast-charging stations; a 350-mile driving range; and a price of $50,000,"" the study said. ""They’ll also need to offer greater vehicle variety.
For now, BCG says only one car meets all of those requirements: the Ioniq 6. The Tesla Model 3 is close behind it.
Again, perception is reality; I would add that several other new EVs also excel at meeting mainstream customer needs, perhaps more than these survey respondents even realized. The Tesla Model Y, ostensibly the best-selling car in the world right now, is the best example of this. Even if the Model Y Long Range's EPA-estimated 310 miles of range is below the 350-mile target EV buyers have, Tesla's ubiquitous Supercharger network should offset any range anxiety.
Having said all of that, the BCG study leaves room for optimism in the EV market. While many automakers have slowed down their EV plans, they have not abandoned them entirely. And the next great segment for EVs, the affordable one, has options coming soon; Ford, Kia, Tesla and others are said to be working on cars in the $25,000 range in the coming years.
Moreover, advancements in battery technology seem sure to yield better ranges, more energy efficiency and quicker charging times; each new model hitting the market seems to improve on all of those things. But Loh said car companies have to keep pressing on with improvements to the customer experience and price for sales to hit the mainstream.
""I'd say by the time we're at 2027, 2028, if you have a full portfolio of second-generation vehicles out there, we'd see about 30% market share for EVs,"" Loh said. ""If however, not all those things go right—either because the [automakers] delay some of these launches because they have profitability concerns, or if we start to see consumers falter a little bit and a price war ensues—that can get as low as 20%.""
And that's right when the EV market should really start heating up, thanks to stricter regulations cemented by the Environmental Protection Agency just last week. Those take effect starting with the 2027 model year and get stricter over time through the 2032 model year. The question will be whether automakers, the charging industry and policy decisions can meet that moment.
""With 70% of U.S. consumers stating they would consider buying an EV, the market opportunity is there,"" the study said. ""But will [automakers] and their shareholders overcome the profitability challenges and stay the course with the required investments? Will policymakers and the charging ecosystem step up to the plate? The answers to these questions will determine the pace of the U.S. EV transition.""

"The Fiat 500e, Which Is Only Sold As An EV, Might Get A Gas Engine Option Too",https://insideevs.com/news/713433/fiat-500e-gasoline-conversion-report/,The same EU cybersecurity laws that killed the Porsche Macan will reportedly retire the previous-gen gas-powered 500.,3/22/2024 10:00,"The latest generation of the cute Fiat 500 urban hatchback is only available as an electric vehicle–and it’s coming to the United States, too. However, the previous generation that came to life way back in 2007 is still going strong on the Old Continent powered by combustion engines.
But that might change soon, as the European Union’s updated cybersecurity law will reportedly prevent Fiat from selling the almost 20-year-old ICE urban runabout. One possible solution? Convert the new 500e to run on gasoline.
Conversion but the other way around
Usually, when we hear about an EV conversion, it's about an old gasoline-powered car that was modified to run on electricity. But a new cybersecurity law that goes into effect in the European Union this spring might make Fiat go the other way around with the latest generation of the 500 urban hatchback.
While that might seem counterintuitive, seeing how Fiat had its sights set on only offering the new 500 as a battery-powered vehicle, the market reality is that the old, combustion-powered model is still a strong competitor in Europe. According to Jato Dynamics, a little over 170,000 units of the Fiat and Abarth 500 were sold last year in Europe, of which almost 109,000 were gasoline models.
More Fiat Stories
As a result, Fiat sent a letter to its suppliers asking if they could help with an annual production increase of almost 100,000 units at the Mirafiori plant in Italy, according to Il Corriere Della Sera. At the same time, Automotive News Europe, citing some of Fiat’s suppliers, wrote that nearly the entire production increase will be represented by gas cars.
The same cybersecurity law that might affect the previous-gen Fiat 500 prompted Porsche to pull the plug on the gas-powered Macan and 718 in the EU. Those models will still live on in countries where the cybersecurity requirements are more lenient, including the United States, while customers in the EU will get all-electric new generations for both models.
Another option would be to update the old model to comply with the new law, but that might prove to be less cost-effective than converting the EV to run on gasoline. That's because most, if not all of the electric architecture would need to be changed or updated.
Currently, the gasoline Fiat 500 is made in Poland, while the new 500e is made at the company’s iconic Mirafiori plant, on the same assembly line that was used to build the ICE Alfa Romeo MiTo.",Iulian Dnistran
BMW's Neue Klasse EVs Aim To Be Profitable As Gas Engines Get More Expensive,https://insideevs.com/news/713353/bmw-profit-neue-klasse-x/,"At ""high volume,"" BMW's new crop of EVs aim to make just as much money as ICE vehicles—which are not getting cheaper to build.",3/21/2024 19:18,"In every way possible, from design to performance to financial stability, the original Neue Klasse (""New Class"") cars of the 1960s and '70s defined what we understand BMW to be today. That BMW's next generation of electric vehicles bears the same name underscores how important they are to the German automaker's future as well. And in time, the hope is that these EVs will reach the same level of profitability as BMW's internal combustion engine cars—which, by the way, are not getting cheaper to build.
Very much the opposite, said Frank Weber, BMW's management board member in charge of development on a media roundtable this week after the debut of the new Vision Neue Klasse X. That car, its sedan counterpart and the new ground-up EV platform both use are very big deals for BMW, Weber said.
And the company certainly does not plan on losing money on them.
BMW is doing surprisingly well in the EV race
The maker of the Ultimate Driving Machine is still offering combustion vehicles and hybrids, but its EVs tend to overperform on range. Moreover, they made up 15% of BMW's total global sales last year, which is much higher than most rivals. Its next-generation ""New Class"" EVs aim to do even better.
""Once this is in high-volume—which means it's very difficult to have this from the first day on—when everything is in full swing and running at the capacity it was designed for, then you will see margin parity [or] the same profitability level with the combustion engines,"" Weber said.
BMW's Neue Klasse platform and its next-generation technology are designed for that purpose, Weber said. He explained that these projections are expected in the next four years or so, with Neue Klasse production running at ""full volume"" around 2027.
Reaching cost parity and profitability levels on par with gas engines is a major priority of the auto industry as it struggles to transition to a mostly electric future. By some estimates, automakers are, on average, losing around $6,000 on each EV sold at $50,000. Luxury automakers like BMW, Porsche and Audi have fared better thanks to their higher price tags. Meanwhile, even luxury startups have their own challenges of achieving the scale needed to survive long-term.
Weber added BMW's EV profitability goals account for an anticipated cost increase in making combustion engines as well. That's because of ever-stricter environmental rules in the U.S., Europe and China, all of which mean gas and diesel engines have to run more cleanly, a cost increase BMW will have to deal with over time.
""Future emission regulations also will add significant cost to the combustion engine,"" he said.
For now, BMW finds itself in a surprisingly good position to undertake that transition. Its current lineup of EVs, like the BMW i5, i4 and iX, are profitable, a company spokesperson told InsideEVs.
And while it has not committed to an end date for its combustion engines as other automakers have, it has ended production of them at its historic headquarters in Munich and had an extremely successful 2023 on the EV sales front. Last year, BMW pulled off a record 376,183 global electric sales, a relatively high 15% of its total volume.
Meanwhile, Weber said, BMW offers a range of powertrains—combustion, hybrid and EV—in its lineup, and right now that variety approach seems to be working.
""There is a type of uncertainty in the market that we are observing,"" Weber said. ""For us, it is really key that you find the right solution"" for your individual needs, he added.
Even so, the Neue Klasse platform is a quantum leap over BMW's successful current EV offerings. The platform has been developed from the ground up with all-electric vehicles in mind, unlike some current models, and it integrates batteries in the structure of the car instead of placing them on a plate that sits on the floor. It will pack new batteries rated at 75-, 90-, and 105-kWh capacities, as well as an 800-volt electric architecture capable of charging speeds of up to 270 kilowatts—which should make these cars among the quickest-charging ones on the road.
The Vision Neue Klasse X is expected to go on sale in the second half of next year, possibly named the next-generation iX3. BMW officials said it will eventually be built in Hungary, China and Mexico, which should allow it to qualify for EV tax incentives.
The Neue Klasse EVs will use new cylindrical battery cells capable of more energy density, higher range and reduced charging times compared to BMW's current EVs. Moreover, Weber said that the Neue Klasse previews whole new families of technologies that will be seen throughout the BMW product portfolio, including hybrid and gas-powered cars. ""Everything you see on that car ends up in series production,"" he said, which could include more powerful onboard computing, more advanced automated driving functions and potentially other functions.
""The Neue Klasse will renew all the technologies that will be available throughout the BMW product portfolio,"" Weber said. ""It is part of our strategy to make this latest technology available to most of our products in a very, very short period of time.""

High Insurance Costs On Chinese EVs Are Scaring Away UK Buyers,https://insideevs.com/news/713295/high-insurance-uk-chinese-byd/,"Long repair times and parts scarcity are driving up rates, and the high premiums are scaring away buyers.",3/21/2024 13:30,"Chinese vehicles may be a hot-button issue in the United States, but they're already taking root in Europe. Automakers BYD, Great Wall Motors, MG, and more have attracted buyers due to pricing, value, and surprisingly good quality, but not all that glitters is gold. But reports from several sources allege that the high insurance costs of new Chinese EVs are scaring off some price-conscious buyers, and the reasons why aren't surprising.
According to CityAm, a UK-based finance outlet, UK insurance companies are facing hardships when it comes to new Chinese vehicles. The outlet cited “A dearth in replacement parts, poor cooperation between insurance firms and Chinese manufacturers and a lack of technical knowledge of the new vehicles,” which in turn is driving up UK drivers’ insurance rates.
EVs Can Be Expensive To Insure
EVs can be more expenisve to repair, with some sources claiming that the average EV insurance claim is around 25% more expensive than a comparable gas-powered car. Also, some EV startups are struggling to meet the demand for replacement parts or supply tradesmen with accurate repair instructions.
This isn’t the only report of this problem, either. Earlier this month, Auto Express honed in on BYD with similar complaints. The BYD Seal may be in the running for the World Car of the Year award, but UK body shops are struggling to repair any BYD in the country.
Auto Express cites similar reasoning: “A lack of understanding about how Europe’s repair market works, and a failure to provide the correct parts and information that would allow cost-effective repairs to be carried out following accidents.”
When these cars are damaged, they can end up with long repair times, as body repair shops wait for replacement parts for repairs that theoretically shouldn’t be all that complicated. In other cases, repairs that would be somewhat routine on any typical European or Japanese brand, have straight-up totaled out a Chinese car. That’s not great news for the insurance rates of Chinese EV models.
Thus, some insurance companies are simply opting not to insure these vehicles at all. When drivers can find insurance, the quotes are far more expensive than a typical gas-powered vehicle of the same size and prestige.
The reputation of EVs being expensive to insure and repair is a global problem. We’ve learned this with Tesla and other brands; batteries are pricy devices that are often unfixable when damaged in an accident, leading the car to become totaled more easily. Also, because of the high-voltage nature of electric vehicles, many technicians must have proper training to perform certain procedures, which inherently means they’re more expensive.
It seems that the new Chinese EV startups have fallen into the same issues that have plagued other brands, albeit prompted by a mismatch in culture. Tesla has only gotten somewhat better in recent times, but it’s still not great. We can’t forget that high repair costs are one of the factors that caused Hertz to drop most Teslas from its EV fleet.
Still, both sources were adamant that there was nothing wrong with the cars themselves. When they’re undamaged, they’re still competent vehicles, and BYD, MG, and Great Wall Motors explained that they were taking steps to better understand how the European market works, and rectify the problems. With some luck, insurance prices will drop down to reasonable levels.

Volkswagen's Cupra Brand Is Coming To The U.S. With Two EVs: CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/713290/volkswagen-seat-cupra-usa/,"By the decade's end, the VW Group will plan a bigger electric U.S. expansion with SEAT's Cupra brand and ""a new distribution model.""",3/21/2024 9:57,"If you're an American who's traveled to Europe or Mexico, you might have noticed cars from Volkswagen's SEAT brand. Once an independent Spain-based automaker, SEAT spent years making more stylish, sometimes more competitively priced versions of Volkswagen's cars, which made it a hit in many parts of the world. So much so that SEAT spun off its performance-focused label Cupra into a standalone, sporty, EV-focused brand in 2018. Cupra's cars look much more aggressive than your average VW, but so far, the U.S. hasn't gotten any of that love.
That's going to change in a few years. At SEAT's annual media conference today in Barcelona, Wayne Griffiths, who serves as CEO of both brands, announced that Cupra will debut in the U.S. by the end of this decade with two new all-electric SUVs.
The Volkswagen Group aims to conquer America in a big way
SEAT's Cupra brand, along with the relaunched Scout Motors brand, represent big EV-focused ambitions for the Volkswagen Group in America. The conglomerate is huge in the rest of the world but has long struggled for the same level of mainstream success in the U.S. as other ""imports"" like Toyota and Honda.
""We want to build on our outstanding success in overseas markets,"" Griffiths said. ""But when we talk 'global,' when we say 'bigger,' we mean the United States of America.""
Griffiths said the company had been examining a possible U.S. entry for some time as it seeks more of a worldwide presence, but now it's official. ""We know it's a matter of being well-prepared and doing it right if you go to the U.S., so after testing the brand, we know our cars will reflect what customers are looking for.""
Griffiths said the company plans to start with an electric version of the Formentor crossover, and an as-yet-unnamed ""bigger"" electric SUV. (They really do know the U.S. market, it seems.) The cars will be built at Volkswagen's North American factories, including Mexico, which should qualify them for EV tax credits.
He added that Cupra will launch in key states, and it seems focused on the two coasts and the Sun Belt. And as for sales, Cupra may be up to something interesting here. ""This will be done through a new distribution model,"" he said, but didn't elaborate further.
It's all a very fascinating move from the Volkswagen Group—especially the ""new distribution model"" part of the equation. It is possible Cupra could dip into some form of direct-to-consumer sales like Tesla or Rivian, or some new hybrid system that may work with some established dealers. It remains to be seen how VW's various dealers in America will feel about this, but automakers everywhere are experimenting with new ways to get cars to customers—including, in some cases, as dealers balk at selling EVs.
But the move also fits with the VW Group's more aggressive focus on the U.S. market. While its brands are dominant globally, and Porsche and Audi are both iconic and profitable here, the VW Group as a whole lacks the immense presence it has in Europe and other places. That's a big reason it's launching the new Scout Motors electric truck brand, complete with its own factory in South Carolina. Adding Cupra to that mix with an EV focus will only help to bolster things here.
InsideEVs has reached out to the VW Group for more information and we will update if we learn more.

Subaru Can Do This Or Rivian Can Do It For Them,https://insideevs.com/news/713192/subaru-panasonic-rivian-r3x/,"It's good news that Subaru and Panasonic's battery partnership is taking shape, because Rivian's plans seem ready to take its business.",3/20/2024 17:29,"It's good news that Subaru and Japanese electronics giant Panasonic are finally moving forward on their long-awaited lithium-ion battery partnership. Plenty of Subaru loyalists who were drawn to the brand's earthy image, but disappointed in its lack of modern EV offerings, will likely be thrilled to hear that it's doing more than ""nothing"" to prepare for an electrified future. But Subaru's problem is that many of those same loyalists are itching for the day when reservations open up for the Rivian R3 and R3X.
That may sound preposterous on its face. After all, Subaru is a well-established, much-loved brand with a lineup that's affordable, capable and in many cases, quite fun. It sold 632,086 cars in America alone in 2023—up 13.6% from the previous year—and globally, there's no reason to believe it won't report handsome profits when its fiscal year ends this month.
Japan's automakers enter ""crisis mode"" in EV race
Though an early pioneer with cars like the Nissan Leaf, Japan has resisted plug-in cars to focus more on hybrids and hydrogen power. But with China's EV industry rising in the world, it's now scrambling to catch up. Arguably, the ones most behind are smaller players like Subaru and Mazda.
Everything Subaru is doing is fine, for now. It has the new Crosstrek Wilderness coming to the New York Auto Show next week, and that should sell just fine, along with the rest of the lineup that includes no hybrids or EVs that weren't made by Toyota. The little national park stage will be back at the auto show, full of cars powered by Boxer four-cylinder engines.
It's all fine. For now.
Beyond ""for now"" is where things feel tricky for Subaru. It's a latecomer to the electric world, like the rest of Japan's auto industry, spooked by the concept of plug-in cars thanks to natural resource scarcity and a fairly recent nuclear energy disaster. But lately, Japan seems even more spooked by its declining presence in China—where Subaru is barely a player anyway—or the fact that cars from China's BYD are snapping up awards like the Japan EV of the Year.
As of a few weeks ago, Subaru has another problem: the fact that American EV startup Rivian is generating considerable hype (and, in the case of the R2 SUV, reservation dollars) running an electric version of the Subaru playbook. Take a look at the R3, for example. It's a boxy, compact hatchback with SUV-like ride height and available all-wheel-drive from a dual-motor setup.
It looks every bit as capable and outdoor-friendly as any Subaru, ready for adventures on the pavement or off. With prices expected to start around $37,000 before any tax incentives, the R3 seems poised to hit the affordable, mass-volume arena Subaru has long played in.
And that's before we even get to the R3X, which Rivian calls ""a performance variant of R3 offering even more dynamic abilities both on and off-road,"" with a design inspired by the Lancia Delta Integrale and Audi Quattro coupe.
If you don't think that sounds like an electric Subaru WRX or WRX STI, the kind Subaru itself hasn't bothered to make, get your hearing checked.
I'm not the first person to draw the comparisons between Rivian and Subaru. Writing for climate-focused publication Heatmap News recently, writer Andrew Moseman did the same, along with the general disappointment around Subaru's nearly nonexistent electrified game:
Even as its cars became more generic and ordinary in the 21st century, Subie kept its marketing efforts aimed at the outdoorsy, dog-loving folks who had become loyal to the brand. However, while its fans are the kind of people with a clear, vested interest in addressing climate change, the world’s “we love the parks” car company has dragged its toes on joining the electric vehicle revolution that hopes to slash the car industry’s carbon emissions. Subaru’s electric aversion left a giant hole in the market for an adventure EV, one that Rivian seeks to fill.
The same reactions took place on social media too around the time of the Rivian debut event a few weeks ago. After all, the R2, R3 and R3X offer more than we've really ever heard on the electric front from Subaru. All of them look production-ready, even if the R2 isn't even due out until the first half of 2026 (barring any delays, which often happen in the EV world.) We've even seen video of an R3 prototype zooming around California after the event.
All of this is to say: Subaru, where are you on anything electrified?
So far, what we have are vague plans, rumors and announcements. Those include, reportedly, leaning on Toyota yet again for an upcoming three-row electric crossover built in the United States, more hybrids, and ultimately, four all-electric crossovers by the end of 2026. Which is a year and a half away. And all Subaru had to show for itself at the ""don't count us out yet"" Japan Mobility Show last year was a low-slung sports coupe concept and a flying car.
Subaru is out there trying to recreate the SVX, and Rivian has already shown us exactly how it aims to take down the Outback and Crosstrek in the next few years.
Granted, the company has alluded to its future plans in financial documents, especially out of Japan. ""Previously, the 2030 target was for [hybrid electric vehicles] and BEVs to account for at least 40% of our total global sales,"" officials said last August. ""We have now raised the target [for] 50% of Subaru's total global sales to be BEVs, which will be achieved by selling 600,000 BEVs out of our total global sales of 1.2 million-plus Subaru vehicles."" They added, ""On the U.S. side, we plan to start U.S. production of BEVs as well as next-generation HEV models using Toyota Hybrid System (THS) technology."" But we haven't seen anything concrete from Subaru yet beyond announcements, while Rivian is taking pains to show us exactly what it wants to do.
None of this is meant to erase Rivian's own challenges. As our own Kevin Williams reported recently, it remains in the ""Valley of Death"" startup mode until it can ramp up these more mass-volume models. It doesn't even sell cars outside of the United States and Canada, it just hit pause on a new factory in Georgia, it's had to do layoffs to keep costs down, and it will likely rely on the expensive R1S and R1T to stay afloat for years—two vehicles it reportedly loses five figures on each one it sells. And if we're comparing Rivian to Subaru, the latter still sold 13 times as many cars in the U.S. last year alone than the former.
But we've seen what happens when legacy automakers underestimate startups before. The model for disruption exists and it's playing out every day. As Rivian rolls out Tesla Supercharger integration, Subaru offers electrified nothing except for a car another company makes. Given global trends that include pure internal combustion peaking around 2017 and massive investments into battery plants and charging, Subaru has to put up or shut up sooner rather than later. And no, I don't mean flying cars, either.
At this point, Rivian feels like a company that's getting ready for the future. Subaru has some work to do to show its many fans across the world that its future doesn't mean becoming an in-house forklift manufacturer for Toyota.

The EPA’s New Emissions Standards Mean A More Gradual EV Transition,https://insideevs.com/news/713144/epa-announces-new-emissions-standards-evs/,"Experts say the standards are worth celebrating, but they don’t go far enough to meet U.S. obligations towards climate change.",3/20/2024 11:30,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the most stringent emissions rules in U.S. history. These regulations promote a shift towards an American car market more dominated by electric vehicles, but implementing these rules would now allow car companies some breathing room.
The move from the EPA marks the final version of emissions rules for light- and medium-duty vehicles sold between 2027 and 2032. In a departure from its initial proposal, the final ruling mandates a more gradual penetration of electric vehicles during the program's early stages.
However, the ultimate goal of serious emissions reductions by 2032 remains in place.
Policy drives the EV transition
In countries where EV adoption has been successful, like Norway and China, policy and government-led push on the demand side made EVs popular and led to emissions reductions. The U.S. is comparatively late to the party, but these are the strictest measures it has ever passed to move away from gas cars.
The initial proposal, which the EPA released in April last year, recommended automakers increase their share of battery-powered EVs to account for two-thirds, or about 67%, of their new passenger vehicle sales by 2032 to meet the CO2 emissions criteria. That proposal got overwhelming support from environmental groups, but staunch opposition from others.
However, after months of lobbying and rebellion from automakers, dealer groups, and petroleum companies—many of whom argued Americans were not ""ready"" for such a drastic change, and neither is the nation's charging infrastructure—the EPA has amended its program.
The amendments consider the challenges automakers are facing in expanding their EV businesses, the considerable time needed to expand the nation's charging infrastructure, and also gives consumers time to cultivate interest and education in EVs.
The EPA's final guidance emphasizes reducing emissions across a brand's entire fleet. For light-duty vehicles the industry-wide average target starts at 170 grams per mile of CO2 emissions by 2027 (as opposed to 152 grams/mile in the initial proposal), gradually reducing to 85 grams/mile by 2032 (instead of 82 grams/mile initially).
The rules also require automakers to significantly slash the number of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter their vehicles emit. Here’s a table comparing the proposal and the final standards from 2027 to 2032:
As you can see, the new standards require less CO2 emissions over time—especially coinciding with more EVs, which have no tailpipe emissions—but aren't as tough as before. Until America gets to 2032, of course, and then we start to see a closer target to the original plan.
Moreover, automakers can choose to sell between 30-56% BEVs as a part of their overall production to meet the emissions targets, according to a fact sheet the EPA shared with reporters—but these exact percentages aren't required, as long as OEMs meet the multi-pollutant criteria.
During a virtual White House briefing with reporters that InsideEVs was a part of, a senior administration official said that the new standards are technology-neutral and that the governing metric is grams per mile, not any particular propulsion type or percentage of BEVs.
With the new standards, the EPA estimates that the average annual fuel savings in 2032 will be about $6,000, and the U.S. will save 14 billion gallons of oil between now and 2055.
Carmakers can choose what percentage of BEVs or PHEVs they want to sell. But to meet the targets, it goes without saying that they would have to ramp up their BEV sales significantly. The EPA estimates that its standards would give the EV market the time it requires to mature.
Still, they will help save about 7.2 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions over the life of the program.
Another senior official said that the Biden administration was confident that the availability of EVs would grow dramatically in the years to come.
Citing J.D. Power's data, he said that 70% of the American public will have an EV available in the price and product category that they typically shop by the end of 2024. That estimate feels a bit overly optimistic, considering the rate of EV adoption is slowing (though the category is growing quickly overall), but many new and affordable models are indeed launching in the next few years.
However, some environment advocacy groups think the EPA’s finalized emissions standards are inadequate.
""The [alternative ruling] will avoid more vehicle pollution and save more lives than we have under current regulations,"" Chelsea Hodgkins, Senior ZEV Policy Advocate at Public Citizen, told InsideEVs in an interview. ""That's important to celebrate. But I think it doesn't go far enough to meet our obligations. The U.S. is the largest historic emitter.""
Hodgkins added that even the EPA’s initial preferred standard would not have helped the U.S. get where it needs to. Citing data from Climate Action Tracker, Hodgkins said the U.S. requires between 95-100% EV penetration by 2030 to keep the planet from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.
“It's hugely problematic because this slow rollout means more gas-powered vehicles on the road. There will also be more hybrids on the road, which from our perspective are gas-powered vehicles with better fuel efficiency,” Hodgkins said. “We want to celebrate progress, but we must acknowledge that this is so much more limited than what we need and it's disappointing that industry pressure is what got us here.""
Consumer insights and data analytics firm J.D. Power indicated that the charging infrastructure was the more urgent matter to address.
“The readiness of the charging infrastructure is well behind the readiness to produce and sell the vehicles. Until this disconnect is resolved, requiring automakers to produce more EVs will not cause consumers to buy more EVs,” Doug Betts, president of the auto division at J.D. Power, told InsideEVs.
Environmental non-profit Sierra Club, on the other hand, which was also lobbying for a stricter standard along with Public Citizen, Tesla, and several other pro-EV groups, had a more positive take on the final rules.
“The Biden administration’s new clean car standards will save lives and money for families,""  Sierra Club’s Executive Director Ben Jealous said. ""With investments from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act underway, these new standards will further help U.S. manufacturers in building American-made and union-built zero-emission vehicles.""
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry's main trade group that includes members like Toyota, General Motors, Ford, and pretty much every major automaker that sells cars in the U.S., likely played a significant role in influencing the EPA's final rules. Its main argument was to allow time for the market to shift organically.
“Pace matters. Moderating the pace of EV adoption in 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 was the right call because it prioritizes more reasonable electrification targets in the next few (very critical) years of the EV transition,"" John Bozzella, president and CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation said.
“These adjusted EV targets—still a stretch goal—should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up. It buys some time for more public charging to come online, and the industrial incentives and policies of the Inflation Reduction Act to do their thing,"" he added.
The new emissions standards, with the updated fuel economy rules finalized by the U.S. Department of Energy yesterday, allow brands to sell polluting gas cars for an extended period. The impact of this slower approach will also likely have climate consequences. Regardless, these are the strongest standards the U.S. has ever passed to pivot towards cleaner transportation—a sector that causes the most pollution in the country.
With an impending presidential election, what remains to be seen is whether this new policy will stick through the decade. President Donald Trump, who almost certainly will be the Republican nominee again, worked to roll back EPA emissions standards and has lately vowed to undo the Biden administration's policies if reelected.
At the same time, many car companies are moving forward with their EV plans regardless of regulatory uncertainty. This week alone, Stellantis joined with Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volvo to voluntarily reduce car emissions over time in an agreement with California, which has the power to set its own standards.

The DOE Finalizes New Mileage Rules To Boost EV Sales,https://insideevs.com/news/713025/doe-relaxes-mileage-rules-for-evs/,The DOE updated its methodology to represent the real-world EV economy more accurately.,3/19/2024 14:03,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has finalized new rules to estimate the mileage of electric vehicles. The ruling better represents the real-world efficiency of EVs and is expected to help the industry pivot toward an electrified future by facilitating carmakers to sell more EVs.
The proposal required gas-equivalent EV mileage ratings to be slashed by 72% by 2027. That means the petroleum equivalency factor (PEF) was set at 23.2 kilowatt hours per gallon by 2030—something OEMs said was harsh. But the new rules soften that target, and automakers can now gradually phase in their mileage requirements through 2030.
EV Regulation Undergoes A Major Overhaul.
Mileage and emissions rules finalized this week would shape how the EV industry grows through the decade and beyond. The rules are designed to give carmakers more time to adopt EVs, while minimizing penalties, but sharply increasing EV penetration from 2030.
Under the new rules, the PEF is set at 82 kWh/gallon for 2024-2026, and it would gradually reduce to 29 kWh/gallon by 2030 and beyond. This allows U.S. carmakers to build more gas-powered cars through 2030, but still meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, Reuters reported.
Environment groups argued that the previous rules allowed carmakers to offset the fuel consumption of gas cars by selling just a small percentage of EVs.
“The automakers’ free ride is over,” said Pete Huffman, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The old calculation included a multiplier of nearly seven that significantly inflated the calculated fuel economy of EVs. DOE’s final rule phases out the multiplier while updating other data used in the calculation with more current figures.”
Automakers were caught off guard by the initial proposal that an auto industry group said would have resulted in $10.5 billion in penalties for not complying with the proposed fuel economy standards. The final order diminishes the gas-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs by 65% (instead of 72%) through 2030.
The news comes after Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the DOE last year to update how EV fuel economy is calculated, instead of relying on what is a two-decade-old methodology.
In simple terms, the DOE determines equivalent fuel economy values for EVs using urban and highway energy consumption values from EPA test cycles. It then converts combined energy consumption to MPGe. The updated rules would determine the EV economy by factoring in energy consumption, grid efficiency, and long-term energy projections.
The non-profit said that by overstating the MPGe figures of EVs, the previous method of calculation allowed automakers to sell far more gas cars. Sierra Club also said that these mileage requirements are “wholly separate” from the EPA’s final emissions standards due on Wednesday.

"Ford's 'Skunkworks' EV Project Includes $25,000 Truck, Compact SUV: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/712872/ford-skunkworks-project-includes-compact-suv-truck/,"The first model is coming in 2026, and it will be powered by an LFP battery.",3/18/2024 17:52,"The fear of affordable Chinese EVs entering the U.S. through Mexico has rattled American carmakers. But it seems like they are finally responding with some countermeasures to the potential onslaught of Chinese EVs.
Remember Ford’s announcement from last month about an internal “skunkworks” team developing a low-cost electric vehicle platform? Some new details have surfaced about this project. Bloomberg reported today, citing an anonymous source, that the new low-cost EV platform will spawn at least three new electric cars: a compact SUV, a small truck, and an EV designed for ride-hail services.
The renewed urgency to build low-cost EVs in the U.S.
China's low-cost EVs have already entered several overseas markets, including Europe and South America. It could potentially be mayhem for the U.S. auto industry if they landed stateside—with local players risking losing business to cheap, well-made Chinese EVs. But some truly American low-cost EVs might finally be on their way.
Here’s what Bloomberg reported today:
Bloomberg Businessweek has learned that this team consists of fewer than 100 people working on a new electric platform to underpin a compact SUV, a small pickup, and, potentially, a vehicle that could be used for ride-hailing, according to one of the people. The first model will arrive in late 2026, starting around $25,000—matching the expected base price of a low-cost EV that Tesla is working on, the person said.
The report added that despite Ford losing as much as $5.5 billion per year on EVs, these new compact electrics must be profitable within a year of going to market—a huge task for the company but one that could easily define its future.
Not surprisingly, Ford’s small EV will be powered by lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells. LFP batteries are generally cheaper to manufacture, have a longer life cycle, and pose fewer environmental and safety risks compared to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries. However, LFP batteries aren’t as energy-dense as NMC packs. That’s why we typically see them on entry-level models like the standard range rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3 and the entry-level versions of the Mustang Mach-E. The Dearborn automaker is constructing an LFP battery plant in Michigan in partnership with CATL, the world's largest battery maker.
Ford is also exploring other battery technologies to further cut costs, the report said. This rounds out what Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month while announcing the low-cost EV platform. ""All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost, and efficiency, in our EV products. The ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese [automakers],"" he said.
It makes sense for Ford to strike three different segments with one low-cost platform. The one-size-fits-all approach is pretty ubiquitous in the EV era. An electric compact SUV is a no-brainer and would drive sales volumes—Tesla is already working on a rumored $25,000 crossover, or what it internally calls the “Redwood” project. Kia is also said to be working on more affordable electric models like the EV3 and EV2. Any one of them could shake up the EV industry.
Moreover, with rideshare rules increasingly mandating drivers to adopt EVs to meet emissions goals, Ford might not want to leave the opportunity to capitalize on that.
This marks a stark contrast from Ford’s strategy just six years ago. In 2018, Ford deleted small cars from its U.S. portfolio to focus on high-profit margin trucks and SUVs. With EVs, the equation is entirely different. China’s BYD, which surpassed Tesla to become the world’s largest EV maker in 2023, is looking to set up a factory in Mexico, from where it could backdoor cheap EVs into North America. Local players could risk losing business and customers to them.
Currently, Chinese EVs are subject to a 27.5% import tariff and there’s bipartisan support to increase that tariff to 125%. But thanks to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement, cars made in Mexico are tariff-free.
Will the Ford EVs be good enough to take on Tesla and the potential onslaught of Chinese EVs? With China’s stranglehold on the battery supply chain, will they be priced competitively?
Those questions might remain unanswered for a while. But this certainly kicks off a presumably tough battle to build affordable small EVs through the decade.

The EPA May Finalize Tough New Rules To Boost EV Sales This Week,https://insideevs.com/news/712831/tough-new-epa-rules-to-boost-ev-sales/,The ruling is expected to be America’s toughest crackdown on gas car sales while promoting a broader EV adoption.,3/18/2024 11:42,"A major regulatory order this week would decide the near-term fate of the electric vehicle movement in the U.S., impacting not only millions of Americans but also how the world’s second-biggest polluting country tackles climate change.
This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is poised to finalize emissions rules that will effectively require a certain percentage—as much as two-thirds by 2032—of new cars to be all-electric, Politico and other outlets have reported in recent days. The ruling could be announced as soon as this Wednesday.
These standards could first loosen the tough EV requirements between 2027 and 2030, but then mandate an aggressive ramping up of EV sales from 2031. In other words, these revised rules would give car companies a bit of a pass on EVs in the short term, while still pushing for a mostly-electric future starting in the next decade.
Pushback against gas cars is about to get serious on a federal level.
The transportation sector accounts for the largest chunk of greenhouse gas emissions annually. Exhaust fumes from gas cars and trucks are directly linked to health hazards. EVs have substantially lower life cycle emissions, which is why a new ruling mandating broader EV adoption in the U.S. is imminent.
The EPA originally proposed stringent federal emissions standards last April. The initial proposal required two-thirds of new light-duty vehicle sales to be electric by 2032, up from about 8% in 2023. It also focused on systemically eliminating criteria pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides from vehicle emissions—all linked to direct health hazards among the masses.
But the agency received a strong rebuttal from dealer groups, car manufacturers, and petroleum companies for its proposal. Many said the U.S. was not ""ready"" for such an aggressive EV push, as prices remained higher than internal combustion cars on average and the nation's charging infrastructure is rather lacking.
On the other hand, environmental and public health advocacy groups overwhelmingly supported the initial ruling.
However, The New York Times reported last month that the Biden administration was considering relaxing the EPA rules after pressure from carmakers. According to one estimate, the alternative ruling that’s likely to pass would require EV penetration rates to reach 32% by 2027, and then increase every year after that, finally reaching 54% by 2030 and 68% by 2032.
As of 2021, the transportation sector was the largest contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., accounting for 29% of total emissions.
From Politico's story:
Those changes track with an alternative regulatory option that EPA explored in last year’s draft that ratchets down emissions limits evenly rather than front-loading them in early years.
Environmentalists at the time mostly shrugged at the prospect of EPA preparing to finalize a rule that would give car companies more time to go electric — potentially creating room for more gas- and diesel-powered cars to be sold through the late 2020s.
Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, told reporters at a briefing Thursday morning that the anticipated final rule would still deliver 95 percent of the draft’s greenhouse gas emission cuts.
“So let’s be clear that it’s a very, very modest change in carbon pollution,” he said.
Regardless of which alternative the EPA finalizes, the new rules would require EV sales to increase substantially from what they accounted for in 2023—just over 8%. That means carmakers would need to offer a broad range of cost-competitive EVs while the charging infrastructure would also need a major boost.
The new standards would also help the U.S. get closer to its commitment of reducing its emissions by 50% by 2030 under the Paris Climate Accords.
Nonetheless, Biden's approach to EVs is already becoming a hot-button issue as he faces a difficult and bitter election rematch against his Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump. Trump has been beating the drum against EVs on the campaign trail in recent weeks, and at a speech in Ohio this weekend, he said there would be a ""bloodbath"" for the auto industry if he was not reelected.

"For Car Companies, It's 'Damned If You, Damned If You Don't' With Investors",https://insideevs.com/news/712804/volkswagen-investors-tesla-dealers/,"Plus, car dealers, who never wanted to sell EVs anyway, are extra down on them lately, and Tesla settles a racial discrimination lawsuit.",3/18/2024 9:40,"For the past few decades, especially in America but increasingly everywhere, the prevailing culture in business has been the emphasis on short-term results: quarterly returns in particular, agnostic of things like long-term planning and the need for intense research and development investments to get ready for the future. There are exceptions to this, of course, especially in the tech world (though that's been less true as of late.)
But the established car industry is facing a hell of a time convincing investors they can get ready for an electric tomorrow, all while delivering those quarterly and annual financial results investors demand right now. And Volkswagen is emerging as a good case study in that trend, whether it's fair or not.
That kicks off Monday's Critical Materials tech and transportation news roundup. Also on tap today: car dealers bristle even more at selling EVs, and Tesla settles an infamous racial discrimination case.
I'll start this off by sharing a Wall Street Journal article published after Volkswagen's annual conference in Berlin last week, which I also attended. Here's how it starts out:
Volkswagen is the archetypal legacy automaker: flabby, slow-moving and valued as if it is going out of business.
First of all, damn. That's how you write a lede, folks. It's a little too scathing and represents a conclusion I don't agree with—which we'll get to—but it speaks to how investors view things at VW right now.
Most investors don't think very highly of so-called ""legacy"" automakers, which have low profit margins, intense overhead costs and had their viability tested during the Great Recession. Hence the headline on this story, ""Why Volkswagen Is Priced For Failure.""
Ouch, right? This, even as VW reported a $19.6 billion net profit for 2023, up 13% from 2022, alongside double-digit sales increases in Europe and North America. A bigger problem is the slowing market in China, which is why VW issued a much more cautious outlook for 2024.
But the VW Group's valuation remains quite low, even with highly profitable brands like Porsche, Bentley and Audi in its portfolio. Example:
There are more conventional signs of undervaluation, too. VW stock trades at less than four times forward earnings. Toyota, its only peer in scale and global reach, is at 10 times. Chrysler-owner Stellantis, which long traded at a discount even to VW, is now at five times after a stellar 2023.
VW’s results offered plenty of reminders why many investors stay clear of the company. Most simply, it made a net profit of €17.9 billion in 2023, equivalent to $19.6 billion. While that is roughly twice what General Motors earned, it could be much better. In rough terms, Toyota expects to make 50% more net profit for its financial year through March, even though it sold only 20% more vehicles than VW in 2023.
Here's where the ""damned if you do, damned if you do"" part comes in.
The company is throwing money at the problem, both at new EV partners such as XPeng and at its own Chinese operations. This has long been VW’s knee-jerk response to challenges, which doesn’t help investors gain confidence that the company will earn acceptable returns.
Its research and development and capital expenditures combined will amount to a gargantuan 14% of revenue this year at the midpoint of guidance, which it insists will be the peak. By comparison, Toyota expects to spend half as much in its current financial year.
That is because VW is a company that's committing to an all-electric future and openly saying its current internal combustion engines will be its last—something it's said for almost a decade now. It hasn't gotten the EV transition exactly right (no ""legacy"" company has, yet) but it's listening to consumer critiques, growing its EV market share and getting ready to face a raft of electric competitors everywhere, including from China. That's where the ""gargantuan"" research and development and capital expenditures come from.
Again, VW isn't alone here. Ford has the same problem, especially since it breaks out the financial results for its EV division separately and that operation is burning cash as it ramps up operations.
Pivoting to be a battery- and software-powered business is a massively costly and complex effort, but if these car companies don't, they're dead in time. So what do investors want here? Returns right now, or a future? The answer, more and more, seems to be ""both,"" which may not be rooted in reality.
But there's also this:
Investors gravitate to “specific stories” in the embattled auto sector, such as Toyota’s hybrid leadership or the best-in-class cost discipline of Stellantis, says Federated Hermes portfolio manager Dariusz Czoch. Viewed through this lens, VW doesn’t offer much apart from a slow and complex turnaround story, variations of which investors also heard from previous CEOs.
Maybe that's part of VW's problem here—the ""story"" it's telling. What makes it different from every other car company out there that's working on batteries, software and better and cheaper EVs?
Toyota's hybrid story is a good one, for now, but it too is said to be scrambling to ramp up EV investments behind the scenes. In the end, the EV race is going to be a long-haul fight, and maybe investors would do well to get used to that idea.
When you look at the narratives around the so-called ""EV slowdown,"" a lot of that comes from the longer amounts of time the cars spend on dealership lots. But I have often wondered if this is a sign of demand, or of car dealers just being bad at their jobs. Many (but certainly not all) dealers have spent years resisting the EV transition, bristling at the costs involved with charging and not wanting to miss out on revenue from ICE repairs.
But in 2024, they're especially down on EVs, according to a Cox Automotive survey reported by Automotive News:
Dealers' sentiment around EV sales is worsening from a year ago and sinking to record lows, according to Cox Automotive's first-quarter Dealer Sentiment Index, which surveyed 546 franchised and 472 independent retailers from Jan. 30 to Feb. 13.
The survey results show that the EV ""thrill is gone,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""You have to hunt to find the dealer that's optimistic about the EV market growing.""
To calculate the score, Cox asked: ""Compared to last year, how would you describe your EV sales?"" Sentiment for franchised dealers sunk to 43 from 58 a year earlier on a 100-point scale, the lowest score since the question was added in the second quarter of 2021. The score fell 7 points from the fourth-quarter score of 50. A score of 50 is neutral. Scores above that signify strength or growth, while scores below indicate weakness or decline.
Also, this:
A Honda dealer in the Midwest also pointed to dwindling demand. ""The early-adopter audience is exhausted, and it's a tough sell to the general car buyer in many of our markets,"" the dealer said. ""Prices are too high for the inconveniences presented by switching to EV.""
I find this funny coming from a Honda dealer, which sells one (1) EV that is made by General Motors and is also not on sale yet. Sure, man!
But admit it: there is some truth to this. The EV market is moving past the first- and second-wave adopters. Now it needs to break into the mainstream, and that means more affordable and more normal cars everywhere, not just $60,000 SUVs. At some point, the dealers are going to have to get over themselves too, though.
For all its many efforts to advance the EV space, Tesla has never been known as a great place to work, especially if you're a woman and/or a person of color. The Fremont factory in particular has been dogged with countless lawsuits and complaints over working conditions, racial and sexual harassment and abusive managers. (I'd point you to an episode of Vox's Land of the Giants podcast I wrote last year about this very topic, if you want to hear from those inside.)
Now, Tesla has settled one of its most infamous cases, with Black worker Owen Diaz. Here's The Guardian:
Tesla has settled with a former employee in a long-running discrimination case that drew attention to the electric vehicle maker’s treatment of people of color.
The case, which dates back to 2017, centers on allegations that Tesla didn’t take action to stop a racist culture at the factory located about 40 miles (65km) south-east of San Francisco. Diaz, a Black man, alleged he was called the N-word more than 30 times, shown racist cartoons and told to “go back to Africa” during his roughly nine-month tenure at Tesla that ended in 2016.
The same Tesla plant is in the crosshairs of a racial discrimination case brought by California regulators. Tesla has adamantly denied the allegations made in state court and lashed back by accusing regulators of abusing their authority. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a similar complaint against Tesla in September.
Remember, two years ago, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will ""never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.”
I also bring this up here because a rising United Auto Workers union is pondering its next targets after huge wins with the Big 2.5 in Detroit. Will the UAW use this longstanding, well-documented history of worker mistreatment as fodder for another union drive?
There's no bigger target when you think about it.
If you're a company like Volkswagen, and you think you're trying to do the right things even if they don't always succeed at first, what story do you tell?

"Electric Volkswagen GTI For The U.S.: 'I Think The Car Would Sell,' CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/712634/volkswagen-id2-gti-usa-sales/,Volkswagen's American CEO Pablo Di Si tells InsideEVs about the possibility of the ID.GTI coming stateside.,3/15/2024 15:30,"When the Volkswagen ID.GTI Concept debuted last year, it gave fans all over the world some hope that the legendary hot hatchback would survive to be part of the automaker's all-electric future. But that also depends on whether the actual EV, slated to go on sale later this decade as the ID.GTI, will make it to one of the countries that loves the GTI the most: the United States.
The good news is that Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si is as enthusiastic as anyone about that proposition. ""I loved it,"" he told InsideEVs in an interview this week. ""It's a beautiful car. I think it would sell in America. I think it has potential. It's a 'love vehicle' in the U.S.""
The bad news is bringing it stateside may be easier said than done. Whether the ID.GTI can be priced correctly for the U.S. is an open question.
Volkswagen tweaks its all-electric future
Volkswagen has committed to going all-electric in the coming years, while adding more hybrids to its portfolio in the meantime. The ID.GTI concept made a huge splash when it was unveiled last year, but whether it's sized and priced right for the American market is an open question—as is what will happen to the legendary GTI itself in the EV future.
The production version of the ID.GTI Concept has been greenlit for arrival in 2026. The car it is based on, the Volkswagen ID.2, may not make it to our shores. Last year, a VW spokesperson said it wouldn't, and Di Si himself told Car and Driver that it's probably not the right size for U.S. buyers.
Despite its decidedly Golf-like looks, the ID.2 is quite a bit smaller than the current Golf. It's a little closer in size to the subcompact Polo. And American buyers have certainly not been in the habit of buying Golfs in volume like the rest of the world. With the discontinuation of the U.S.-market Golf in 2021, the only variants now sold here are the GTI and the more powerful Golf R.
You can thank those cars' rabid fanbase for that decision. Even as Volkswagen has pivoted heavily to crossovers and SUVs to meet market demand in the U.S.—they make up the bulk of VW's current American portfolio, including the lone EV for now—the GTI and Golf R have a dedicated enthusiast car culture surrounding themselves. The GTI is credited as being the original hot hatchback, and whether it's slammed to the ground or just a bone-stock daily driver, their mix of speed and practicality has made it an iconic gearhead staple on par with the Mazda Miata, Ford Mustang and BMW M3.
And while the ID.GTI's specs haven't been released yet, the ID.2all concept was said to put down 223 horsepower to the front wheels. The ID.GTI will certainly pack a bigger punch, making it more powerful and likely faster than any gas-powered GTI.
So while Di Si wouldn't confirm the ID.GTI for the U.S., he's thinking about what levers could be pulled. ""It would make sense if we hit the price points,"" he said. The company wants a volume-player EV priced around $25,000, Di Si said. If it goes too high, he said it's too much of a ""niche vehicle."" (The current gas-powered GTI starts at around $32,000.)
""Do we have a plan? Not yet, but it is on our radar,"" Di Si said. ""The majority of the cost comes from the batteries.""
Electric performance cars are clearly on Volkswagen's radar in general. This week, the automaker also unveiled the ID.3 GTX, a 321-horsepower variant of its Golf-like electric ID.3, as well as the ID.7 GTX Tourer, a go-fast wagon with 335 hp.
Yet while the ID.3 GTX seems like a shoo-in to take up the GTI's mantle, the ID.3 isn't sold in the U.S. at all. And then there's the question of what's going to happen with the future Golf itself, which is also slated to go electric-only on a new platform.
But that's further down the line. The ID.GTI should be on sale before then, and it would be a shame if American fans had to wait so long for some new electric Golf GTI to appear. Clearly, the ID.GTI is a hype machine already, and with more and more Americans asking for affordable EVs—and even smaller ones—it feels like not bringing this EV hot hatch stateside would be a real misfire.
Let's put it this way: If Dodge can bring somehow the Charger into the electric era, surely Volkswagen can figure this one out.

Tesla’s Official India Entry Almost Confirmed Under New EV Policy,https://insideevs.com/news/712599/india-approves-new-ev-policy-clears-way-for-tesla/,Tesla has been lobbying the Indian government to reduce its punitive import taxes for months.,3/15/2024 15:00,"A major regulatory roadblock has been cleared for Tesla as it plans to expand its presence in South Asia. India, the world’s third-largest passenger vehicle market behind China and the U.S., has agreed to lower its punitive tariffs on certain imported electric vehicles, its commerce ministry announced today.
India imposes up to a 100% import duty on cars manufactured overseas. That means the standard range Tesla Model 3, which starts at $38,990 in the U.S. would cost over $77,000 in India under the current regulations.
Tesla always wanted to go global.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed his desire to expand the automaker's presence globally several times. At one point Musk also wanted to enter Russia, but later called off that operation due to the war in Ukraine. Outside the U.S., Tesla has plants in Berlin and Shanghai. A Mexico gigafactory is under construction and now India just cleared a big regulatory hurdle for the automaker to enter.
These rules have now been relaxed for electric cars as long as automakers invest at least $500 million in local manufacturing. This threshold is much lower than what Tesla was earlier ready to commit, about $2 billion if import taxes were lowered for the first few years.
Asia’s third-largest country will lower import tariffs to 15% if certain conditions are met. They include setting up a local manufacturing facility in three years and reaching 50% “domestic value addition” in five years—to promote localization at an increasing rate in that timeframe.
Only 8,000 EVs would qualify for the lower 15% import tariff annually, and automakers will have to back up their investment with a bank guarantee, the commerce ministry said. Local players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have been lobbying against this move, fearing hurting their own businesses.
But the commerce ministry said that the new rules would “strengthen the EV ecosystem by promoting healthy competition among EV players leading to high volume of production, economies of scale, lower cost of production, reduce imports of crude oil, lower trade deficit, reduce air pollution, particularly in cities, and will have a positive impact on health and environment.""
""It's quite likely that there will be a significant investment relationship with India in the future. Tesla will be in India as soon as humanly possible,"" CEO Elon Musk said last year in New York City where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived for an official state visit. The two also met on the sidelines and courted each other to build a partnership.
According to IQAir data, six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities are Indian. Just like the U.S., India’s transportation sector emits a big chunk of its total carbon emissions.
However, India says this policy isn’t targeted at any one particular company. ""We invite global companies to come to India. I'm confident India will become a global hub for EV manufacturing and this will create jobs and improve trade,"" Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters at a press briefing, Reuters reported.
Tesla already has an office in India in the city of Pune (which also happens to be yours truly’s hometown), but now it would need a strong management team on the ground to clear the local regulatory steps and accelerate its manufacturing goals.
It's unclear which models Tesla will initially import to India and later manufacture. But the smallest and the cheapest would make the most sense, like the Model 3 and the Model Y, and also the upcoming ""Redwood"" project, which is rumored to be called the Model 2.
Three years to build a plant may seem adequate, as Tesla got Giga Shanghai up and running in just ten months—that plant is Tesla’s largest globally by manufacturing capacity. Beyond the U.S. and China, Tesla also has a factory in Berlin, and another one is under construction in Mexico.
However, Elon Musk’s company has a limited presence in the BRICS nations, apart from China of course. India, the world’s most populated country with over 1.4 billion people, has a burgeoning middle class, and a booming tech industry. If its India plant ever materializes, it could become an export hub as several global tech giants look for a ""China plus-one"" strategy in Asia.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the Tesla Model 3's U.S. price. The Model 3 starts at $38,990 as of March 15, 2024. $33,990 is after probable tax credits.

Honda looks at Nissan for EV help after ditching plans with GM
Nissan and Honda are officially looking to work together on electric vehicles. The two Japanese companies signed a memorandum of understanding for a feasibility study today.
In other words, the two companies won’t start working together on a brand-new EV just yet, but if they find common ground during this feasibility study, they’ll collaborate on software development, core components related to EVs (like batteries), and complementary products, the release said.

Yesterday’s report from Nikkei Asia mentioned that Nissan was weighing a partnership with Honda to jointly develop a new electric axle (e-axle), as well as a shared EV platform. If this happens, we might see different EVs from the two Nippon manufacturers that sit on the same architecture, much like General Motors is using its Ultium platform for all its new battery-powered vehicles.
Speaking of Ultium and GM, Honda had a deal with the American auto giant that resulted in the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX all-electric crossovers. The partnership should have continued until at least 2027 and was supposed to give birth to at least one affordable EV, but that plan was scrapped.
Now, Honda might do with Nissan what couldn’t be done with GM. Both Japanese names have multiple new EVs in the works, including sedans and SUVs, but they’re still at least two years away from becoming reality. As it stands today, Nissan sells the Leaf and Ariya in the United States, while Honda has the GM Ultium-based Prologue and Acura ZDX at dealerships.",Iulian Dnistran
"Volkswagen Is Expanding Its EV Lineup, But Not The EV Price War",https://insideevs.com/news/712429/vw-ceo-prices-id7-buzz/,"The VW Group's American CEO weighs in on the ID. Buzz, the ID.7, and why fire-sale price cuts aren't in the cards.",3/14/2024 13:00,"By the end of this year in the United States, Volkswagen's lone all-electric offering will be joined by a sleek, long-range sedan and a retro-throwback van with three rows of seats. But those EVs won't be bringing a 2023-style price war with them.
That's according to Pablo Di Si, the CEO of the Volkswagen Group of America. “What we said last year was value over volume,” Di Si said. “That doesn't mean that we don't care about market share. That means that we're going to take a balanced approach.""
The Volkswagen Group goes all-electric, but not without headaches
After its mid-2010s diesel cheating scandal, the Volkswagen Group—which includes VW, Audi, Bentley, Porsche and more—vowed to go all-electric in the coming years. But software headaches, production issues and profitability challenges have all rendered that goal easier said than done, for now.
Di Si sat down to discuss a wide range of topics with InsideEVs this week in Berlin during the conglomerate's annual press conference and investor report. Those included plans for the upcoming ID.7 sedan and ID. Buzz van, both due on sale later this year.
In the U.S., Volkswagen has joined the price-cut party as well, but it mostly hung out in the back and left after just one drink. ""We have adjusted the pricing on the ID.4 recently, but we have not been as aggressive as other competitors,” Di Si said.
VW North American CEO Pablo Di Si
""Aggressive"" is an accurate way to put it. Starting with a series of rapid-fire cuts from Tesla early last year, several automakers selling EVs—including Ford, Lucid, Rivian and others—also dropped prices to stay competitive. Others have done so more covertly by offering super-cheap lease deals and discounts at dealerships.
Those moves have helped drive electric adoption in America to a record-breaking 8% of the overall market, but they made already-elusive profits from EVs even harder to attain. And worse, those moves tanked the resale values of many electric models.
But Di Si, a straight-talking Argentinian native who previously ran the VW Group's operations in South America, said he's happy with how last year went for the ID.4. He has good reason to be, too. Despite a somewhat rocky initial launch, the ID.4 has been an objective hit. The crossover netted 37,789 U.S. sales in 2023, up roughly 40% year-over-year making up an impressive 11.5% of Volkswagen's total volume.
And that’s all before the ID.4 got serious new upgrades to power, range and software, including over-the-air updates—something Di Si called “a pain in the neck” to implement. The ID.4’s quality is also now “significantly better” than when it launched, he added.
“The first two months went down a little bit to 7.5% EV penetration for the industry [in January and February], but we remain higher,"" he said. ""Now we need to build volume.”
""Value over volume"" has been a mantra at the VW Group since last year, when the world's second-largest carmaker committed to rejuvenating profits for mainstream brands like Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda, while still eventually going all-electric. Some EVs from its luxury brands, like those in the Audi lineup, are already profitable; others, like the newly all-electric Porsche Macan, are going up in price in exchange for vastly increased performance.
Globally, the Volkswagen brand is struggling a bit with slowing sales in China and weaker-than-expected demand for the compact ID.3. But the automaker has said it expects to correct this over time, including with the launch of the upcoming compact ID.2, which aims to be profitable with a starting price of about 25,000 Euros ($27,209 at today's exchange rate). The company also expects that the revived Scout Motors truck brand will help turn things around, with EVs that will be designed and built in America for the American market.
Di Si said volume is coming in the next few years for VW in the U.S. with a larger electric SUV, “which is in our plans."" Presumably, he referred to the three-row ID.8. Until that arrives, the next move is what Di Si calls “halo cars”: the ID. Buzz and ID.7 sedan.
Pricing hasn’t been announced on either one yet, but the ID.7 is expected to start in the $50,000 range, while the ID. Buzz remains anyone’s guess. (The van America gets is a larger, more upscale cousin of the European one, and it has a bigger battery with more range and more power.) Sedan sales in America haven’t been great for years, and as fun and capable as the ID. Buzz seems to be, electric vans are unlikely to unseat crossovers anytime soon.
Instead, they’re meant to “elevate” a brand that has often struggled to find its identity in the U.S. market despite dominance elsewhere, Di Si said.
“It’s a premium car, with premium touch and feel and great range and great infotainment,” Di Si said of the ID.7, which is already shaping up to be one of the longest-range electric cars on the market. “Is it going to sell a lot of vehicles from a value point of view? Probably not. Obviously, I’d like to sell as many ID.7s as I can, right? But from a marketing point of view, I need to be realistic.”
The ID. Buzz is a slightly different story. Though it’s been in the works since 2017, the hype around it remains palpable.
“I think we're going to have a really good problem because the demand is going to be far, far ahead of supply,” Di Si said. And it will likely get people into Volkswagen dealerships, where they may end up driving away in one or something else.
The strategy around these cars also speaks to how much EV tax credits drive decisions these days. Both EVs are imports from Germany, which means they will only qualify for tax credits if they’re leased. Volkswagen actually lucked out by building the ID.4 at its Chattanooga, Tennessee plant; it remains the only “foreign” brand in America to offer full tax credits when purchased or financed.
But even if demand for the ID. Buzz ends up booming, it’s unlikely Volkswagen will find a way to build it in Tennessee, a factory Di Si said is already “at capacity” with what it can do.
“We’ve been discussing this a lot internally and with our dealer council,” he said. “The key here is to keep the product alive after a year, after two years, you need to bring innovation—new concepts, new variants. I think the setup is correct in Hannover, that's where they have the expertise.”
The upgraded ID.4 will have to hold down the fort for a while. The ID.7 is expected to go on sale in the late third quarter of this year, while VW is targeting November for the ID. Buzz.

Correction: An earlier version of this story stated an incorrect figure for VW's U.S. ID.4 sales. We regret the error.

"Global Passenger EV, Hybrid Battery Market Expanded 40% In 2023",https://insideevs.com/news/712261/global-passenger-xev-battery-market-2023/,The combined battery deployment reached roughly 690 gigawatt-hours.,3/14/2024 9:00,"The global passenger xEV (BEVs, PHEVs, HEVs) battery market continued to expand quickly in 2023, partially thanks to record vehicle sales and partially because the average battery capacity is increasing.
According to Adamas Intelligence in 2023, about 689.2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery capacity was deployed onto roads globally in all newly sold passenger xEVs. That's about 40% more than a year ago, the company estimates.
690 GWh of batteries in 2023
One gigawatt-hour (GWh) of battery capacity is 1,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) or 1,000,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh). 690 GWh deployed in 2023 means that on average, almost 1.9 GWh was deployed each day—that's equivalent to almost 19,000 battery packs (100 kWh each).
Let's recall that passenger plug-in electric car registrations increased in 2023 by 35% year-over-year to almost 13.7 million units. All-electric cars represent the highest share of battery deployment, followed by plug-in hybrids. Non-rechargeable hybrids are also contributing to the total number, but to a smaller degree because their battery packs are usually relatively small.
We do not expect the battery market to slow down but rather continue its growth towards higher records. However, it's not certain that we will see a 1 terawatt-hour (TWh) level (1,000 GWh) this year.
Battery capacity deployed onto roads globally (newly sold passenger xEVs):
Adamas Intelligence also noted that the 2023 volume alone is worth 37% of all battery capacity ever deployed. 2023's 690 GWh is more than the volume deployed in eight years, from 2014 and 2021 combined.
While close to 200 brands contributed to the total result, only 16 managed to exceed 10 GWh, while two—Tesla and BYD—were above 100 GWh.
Tesla deployed 132.1 GWh of batteries, according to the report, 37% more than a year ago. BYD achieved 101.6 GWh (up 51% year-over-year), despite selling more cars (3 million units) because it's heavy on plug-in hybrids (about half of the volume).
The China-focused GAC Aion was the best of the rest with 31.1 GWh (up 75%), slightly ahead of Volkswagen, which deployed 30.3 GWh (up 21%). BMW was fifth with 29.1 GWh (up 76%).
It's worth noting that the wider Volkswagen Group, with all its brands, exceeded 50 GWh in 2023, so it seems that it was the third top automotive group.
Top brands (year-over-year change):
In terms of the growth rate, the Chinese Li Auto almost tripled its battery deployment, by selling a lot of extended-range electric vehicles (EREV). Toyota is also starting to take off, more than doubling its result in 2023. The Japanese company might do it again in 2024, and leapfrog some smaller brands.

The partnership between Honda and the American carmaker was supposed to continue until at least 2027 and result in the debut of several budget-minded EVs, but that plan was scrapped late last year.
Now, Honda might team up with its Japanese counterpart to make cheaper EVs a reality. That said, Nikkei writes that the discussions within Nissan are still in their infancy, while Honda’s stance on the partnership is unclear.
The sources quoted by Nikkei said that the two companies may discuss joint battery procurement and vehicle development so that the cost of future EVs goes down enough to compete with Chinese rivals such as BYD, which saw a big rise in deliveries last year, thanks in no small part to its ability to source components like batteries in-house, bringing down the final price.
Honda is planning on releasing at least two brand-new EVs starting in 2026 that will draw inspiration from its latest futuristic concepts, while Nissan is working on a couple of U.S.-made EVs. These were supposed to go into production next year, but they were reportedly pushed to 2026 and 2027 respectively.

Volkswagen Group Reaffirms Internal Combustion Will Be 'Phased Out' Eventually,https://insideevs.com/news/712197/vw-group-new-models-2024/,"Plus, Ford and Tesla get nailed for driver-assistance systems, and when it comes to ""software-defined cars,"" you ain't seen nothin' yet.",3/13/2024 8:30,"You can sum up the last few years in the automotive industry with four words: ""Easier said than done."" That applies to just about every car company with big (or small) dreams for electric, connected and increasingly automated vehicles. The Volkswagen Group, the original ""pivot to electric vehicles"" automaker following its diesel emissions cheating scandal a decade ago, truly embodies this challenge.
It's made tremendous strides to become a company that's ready for the rest of the 21st century, but not without massive headwinds on multiple fronts. Now, after strong sales and profits in 2023, it's preparing the biggest ramp-up of new products its family of brands has ever seen. That move is underpinned by a lot of new EVs—and some flexibility during ""the transition,"" too.
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Also on today's dance card: Tesla, Ford and other automakers get nailed for their driver assistance systems, and the software-driven vehicle revolution hasn't even really gotten started yet.
I'm in Germany this week for the Volkswagen Group's Annual Conference, which isn't just a deep-dive into the conglomerate's 2023 financial results but a look at what's coming next. CEO Oliver Blume, who has been in the top spot since 2022, reaffirmed today that what the Germans often call ""electro-mobility"" is the future of the entire company.
It's coming off a good year to keep that momentum going. In 2023, the VW Group saw deliveries rise 10% globally with an operating profit of €22.6 billion (about $25 billion.) But converting the world's second-largest automaker—one whose portfolio of brands stretches from bargain-basement Skodas and VWs to six-figure Lamborghinis and Bentleys—into a battery-powered business, while staying alive to do it, is far from easy.
Besides the massive costs of ramping up battery and EV production and delays of key products due to software woes, the VW Group is facing a volatile Chinese market, uneven EV demand in the U.S. and Europe, a lackluster charging network basically everywhere, persistent post-COVID supply chain issues and rising interest rates.
Those are not unique challenges. But the VW Group's answer, Blume and his executives said today, is to charge forward with new models. ""2024 will indeed be a record year when it comes to new products,"" he said. ""We are gearing up for the biggest product offensive in the history of the Volkswagen Group... planning to debut over 30 new models across all brands this year.""
Blume added, ""We have already announced some of the new models: the Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, the ID.Buzz Long Wheel Base, the Volkswagen Golf, the Skoda Octavia, the Cupra Tavascan, the all-electric Porsche Macan, and the Audi Q6 e-tron."" More are coming, including the ID.2—an electric quasi-Golf replacement projected to cost around €25,000—and more announcements yet to come.
Then there's more talk of ""the transition"" that wasn't as prevalent when VW was making those all-electric commitments post-Dieselgate. Those include more plug-in hybrids, which it is doing more of, like the new Tiguan PHEV in Europe.
But most interestingly of all, VW execs continue to say the current crop of engines and whatever electrified variants they get is about to be it for that technology.
""We will invest in our last-generation of ICE vehicles,” which are especially key for hybrids, board member and CFO Arno Antlitz said today. Then, he said, “These investments are going to be phased out.”
We'll have more on this event throughout the week on InsideEVs, including from reporter Tim Levin, who's getting a similar preview of what's next from Audi.
Semi-autonomous driving assistance systems like Tesla's Autopilot are said to lay the groundwork for a future much more driven by eventual self-driving cars. But do they really provide a tangible safety benefit to drivers right now?
The answer, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, is not really, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Car companies have been introducing more so-called partially automated driving systems, which control the vehicle’s steering and speed in certain situations, and sometimes allow hands-free driving. The study, released Tuesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, gave a “poor” rating to 11 of 14 systems it tested, concluding that most lack adequate measures to prevent drivers from losing focus on the road.
“Some drivers may feel that partial automation makes long drives easier, but there is little evidence it makes driving safer,” said David Harkey, IIHS president. “As many high-profile crashes have illustrated, it can introduce new risks when systems lack the appropriate safeguards.”
Only Toyota Motor’s Lexus brand earned an “acceptable” rating in the study, for its Teammate feature on the LS sedan, the industry-funded nonprofit group said. Two models received “marginal” ratings: General Motors’ GMC Sierra pickup truck, and Nissan Motor’s Ariya electric SUV.
Driver-assistance features on models from Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz and BMW were given poor grades.
I'm particularly surprised to hear that Ford's BlueCruise got such a bad grade here. In my experience, it's quite good at navigating mapped highways while aggressively noticing when a driver isn't minding the road.
But I think that's part of the problem, right? These systems are, for now, a new and novel way of ""driving"" that's often poorly understood by a public often struggling to understand new tech systems in cars. That's no excuse for systems that feel objectively unsafe at times—Tesla's Full Self-Driving tried to drive me into oncoming traffic twice, and that certainly hurt my feelings—but proper education is a key part of this too.
Finally, I'll leave you with this from Wards Auto. When it comes to the software-defined vehicle—you know, a networked vehicle with advanced autonomy, constant over-the-air updates, subscription features and more—the industry has barely scratched the surface of what it wants to do.
Unsurprisingly, a survey of global automotive executives conducted by chipmaker NXP Semiconductors and Wards Intelligence finds that nearly 60% of the industry believe it will be beyond 2030 before more than half of the new vehicles sold annually in mature markets are software-defined.
[...] The challenges faced by OEMs in deploying OTA updates and upgrades in existing platforms, mainly due to legacy electrical/electronic architecture, monolithic software and limited control over the supply chain (as electronic control units are often vertically designed by Tier 1 suppliers), have driven OEMs to move toward the development of their own automotive software stacks.
Worth a read in full, because that's going to be as key to the future of cars as batteries are, in many ways.
The whole group, not just the brand, either. Where do you want to see the VW conglomerate go next and at what price point?

BYD’s Quality Problems Hit International Markets: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/712148/byd-quality-problems-hit-international-markets/,EVs piling in European warehouses and logistics-related quality issues are new headaches for the world’s largest EV maker.,3/12/2024 16:00,"BYD is running into some new obstacles as it expands its footprint in the Chinese and overseas markets. Chinese-made BYD models shipped to Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia are plagued with quality issues, The Wall Street Journal said in its latest report.
The Warren Buffet-backed automaker had a record sales year in 2023, dethroning Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. It was also the third largest automaker by market capitalization as of the end of last year, right behind Tesla and Toyota.
Chinese EVs are electrifying global car markets.
Cheap and well-made Chinese EVs are transforming EV markets in Asia, the Middle East, and South America. BYD is at the forefront of this with models like BYD Seal, Dolphin, and Atto 3 gaining popularity worldwide.
The recent report states that export vehicles from China require several fixes and repairs when they arrive at their destination. Vehicles that landed in Japan had scratches, and the ones that arrived in Europe had mold, the report stated.
While mold can be a common occurrence in cars, especially when they’re stored for a long duration in humid weather, the issue with BYD cars in Europe was that they didn’t receive the proper treatment to have the mold removed.
In Thailand, where Chinese EVs have taken the domestic automotive market by storm, BYD’s quality issues seem to be mounting. Complaints of paint and plastic peeling have become public. Meanwhile, in Israel, BYD EVs are reported to have warped under the weight of roof racks.
These seem like logistics-related issues, rather than manufacturing defects. A BYD executive told WSJ that the issues were equivalent to “going to a decent restaurant but finding that the plate is chipped.” Some 10,000 BYD cars are estimated to be parked in European warehouses, where they have been waiting to be sold since the end of last year.
Maintaining tight quality control across the global shipping route might be a new challenge for BYD. But it’s too early to gauge if these quality problems are false alarms or something BYD needs to take very seriously.
The automaker’s sales slumped in February 2024 due to an industry-wide slowdown. It is also expected to miss its internal target of selling over 400,000 cars in international markets this year.

Drivers Who Are 'Scared Of Change' Are Part Of EV Adoption Problem: Polestar CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/711514/ev-adoption-slowdown-drivers-scared-of-change-polestar-ceo/,"And we thought the lack of EV education, spotty charging infrastructure, and high prices were the main issues.",3/7/2024 9:30,"Polestar, the maker of the all-electric Polestar 2 fastback and Polestar 3 crossover, only builds battery-powered cars, which has made some analysts and enthusiasts nickname the company “Europe’s Tesla,” even though the cars are made in China.
Last year, the Geely-owned EV maker delivered roughly 54,500 cars worldwide, which isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s worth noting that the bulk share was represented by the Polestar 2. With more cars in the pipeline, the automaker is hoping to turn its fortunes around starting this year, but some striking remarks from its CEO might make that job a bit harder.
Polestar CEO goes after the undecided
Polestar's CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, said during a recent interview with The Telegraph that drivers who are ""afraid of change"" are to blame for the recent EV adoption rate slowdown. However, data from various surveys shows that people who aren't convinced yet about EVs cite the high prices of battery-powered cars and the lackluster charging infrastructure as the major pain points.
According to Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar’s head honcho, quoted by The Telegraph, people who are scared of change are to blame for the slowdown in the EV adoption growth rate.

“To tell you the truth, I think that [it’s about] being open for innovation and the future technology,” he said when asked why people seemed to lose interest in EVs. “I see far too many people hesitating with that and being scared of change. That is just not a good recipe for the future,” the company’s CEO added.
And while it’s true that people aren’t buying as many EVs as some companies thought they would, putting the blame on the consumer isn’t exactly fair. Especially since industry data has shown time and time again that the main reasons why people aren’t buying more EVs are the high purchase price, spotty charging infrastructure, and range anxiety.
There's also a lack of EV-related education about things like how to precondition an EV battery, what battery types there are out there and what are their advantages and disadvantages, maintenance, and more.
Polestar 2
Polestar 3
Polestar 4
At the same time, however, Polestar’s CEO said that rival carmakers who are slowing down their EV rollout plants–names like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford, among others–are falling into a trap because launching a new product at short notice is very hard to do.
“There’s an incredible threat and danger if you don’t embrace future innovation and believe in that technology–the electric drivetrains, the innovation in battery, the innovation in modern electronics and software,” Ingenlath said for The Telegraph. “If you don’t participate in that and think you can wait, and customers are ready for it, it’s an incredible trap,” he added.
It’s worth noting that Polestar only makes all-electric cars and because of this, its CEO is of the opinion that electric propulsion is a superior technology to combustion engines. “It’s not a question of being electric or being combustion engine: this is a question of who has that convincing, great product. I definitely think that is worth the battle and we will win this.”
Thomas Ingenlath’s remarks came after Polestar secured a $1 billion lending lifeline from banks. This happened after Volvo, which had a controlling hand in Polestar, decided to transfer a portion of its 48% stake to parent company Geely. That said, Polestar has said it needs $1.3 billion in funding to reach its goal of breaking even by 2025, which means it needs an additional $350 million in funding.
The company lost $1 billion in 2021 and another $1.3 billion in 2022, while the first nine months of 2023 saw a loss of $735 million, according to the Swedish-based company’s latest earnings report.",Iulian Dnistran
The GMC Hummer SUV Is The First EV On This 'Meanest' Cars For The Environment List,https://insideevs.com/news/711233/gmc-hummer-ev-meanest-cars-environment-list/,The all-electric SUV’s huge weight makes it a not-so-green choice.,3/5/2024 14:00,"The GMC Hummer EV SUV is as much of a four-wheeled statement as the original Hummer H1 was. It’s big, expensive, and packs a lot of off-road tech that will probably never be used.
It’s also quite an electron guzzler, just like its spiritual predecessor was a gas guzzler, requiring about 600-700 watt-hours of energy just to travel one mile, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s mainly due to its massive weight of around 10,000 pounds, 3,000 of which are represented by the battery alone.
The Hummer makes an appearance on the naughy list
Just like its spiritual predecessor, the battery-powered GMC Hummer EV SUV is anything but a green choice. It goes through electrons like it's nobody's business because it weighs roughly 10,000 pounds, making it one of the least efficient EVs in the world. It's also one of the reasons why the ACEEE put it on its annual ""Meanest"" cars for the environment list.
Because of this, the Hummer EV SUV is the first battery-powered car to be featured on the 2024 American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) list of “meanest” vehicles, next to names of gas-burning models like the Ram 1500 TRX, Cadillac Escalade V, Chevrolet Corvette Z06, and Dodge Durango SRT.

The ACEEE gave the GMC Hummer EV SUV a so-called Green Score of 29 (the pickup has a score of 30), with an estimated annual fuel cost of $1,746. To put that into perspective, the list of “greenest” cars is spearheaded by the plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius Prime SE with a Green Score of 71 and an estimated annual fuel cost of $529 (if the car is driven 15,000 miles per year).
The Green Score is based on a lifecycle assessment of the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from the production, use, and disposal of each vehicle. the non-profit says it also assesses the upstream emissions generated by the electricity used by an EV, just like it assesses the emissions from fuel burned by an ICE vehicle.
The emissions produced when mining and processing minerals for batteries, as well as from the vehicle manufacturing process are taken into account, too, the ACEEE says.
With all this being said, even though the GMC Hummer EV SUV is on the naughty list, all the cars on the “Greenest” list are either EVs, PHEVs, or hybrids, so going down the battery-powered route is clearly an environmentally friendly way of getting around–if the car doesn’t weigh as much as an apartment building, that is.
According to the full list, the Lexus RZ 300e is the best choice when it comes to EVs, followed by the previous-generation Mini Cooper SE (which will be replaced by a new model) and the Nissan Leaf.
Curiously, though, the highest-rated Tesla, the Model Y, only has a Green Score of 57, even though it consumes less energy per mile than the Mini Cooper SE which has a Green Score of 67. The Model Y AWD consumes 280 Wh/mile, while the Cooper SE needs 310 Wh/mile, according to the EPA. Then again, it’s not just the energy consumption that makes up the score.

Lucid EVs Are Super Efficient Already. They Aim To Get Significantly Better,https://insideevs.com/news/710815/lucid-efficiency-holy-grail/,Company CEO Peter Rawlinson said this milestone is vital for EVs to “save the planet.”,3/2/2024 10:28,"Lucid makes what is ostensibly the most efficient luxury electric sedan on the market, the Air. But according to head honcho Peter Rawlinson, EVs need to become even more efficient to “save the planet."" He noted in an interview with the UK's Autocar that “the holy grail” would be an electric car capable of driving 6.2 miles (10 km) on one kilowatt-hour of energy calculated according to the stringent US EPA guidelines for EVs.
That’s about 1.5 times more efficient than the most frugal version of the Lucid Air, the entry-level Air Pure RWD. The Pure RWD's EPA-rated 4.1 miles/kWh puts it considerably ahead of the most efficient version of the Tesla Model S. It's only beaten by the Hyundai Ioniq 6.
EV efficiency is key
Many EV advocates believe that efficiency—the ability to turn energy into motion without waste—is an even more important metric than just driving range. Startup Lucid is a leader in EV efficiency and doesn't believe bigger batteries alone are the key to maximizing range.
It should be noted that Lucid rates the driving efficiency of the Air Pure, with 19-inch wheels, differently (and higher) than the EPA does at 4.76 mi/kWh. A Lucid spokesperson told InsideEVs that their calculation deals more with how much energy from the battery the car will need to travel a certain distance, and not how much energy you'll need if you are fully recharging a nearly dead battery with a home charger. ""Or to put it another way, 4.7 mi/kwh is battery-to-wheel, in contrast with the EPA numbers which measure wall-to-wheel,"" the spokesperson told us.
As a result, Rawlinson told Autocar that the company thinks the Air can be pushed to 5 miles/kWh “pretty soon,” although he didn’t say when or how Lucid was going to achieve this significant efficiency gain.
The Lucid boss held a talk during the Car of the Year event held at this year’s Geneva Motor Show. “People think that we’re on a bandwagon of making expensive, luxury SUVs but we’re here to advance the technology with state-of-the-art EVs,” he said, per Autocar.
This is a reiteration of what he’s said many times in various contexts, promoting a company philosophy that transcends the brand and portrays Lucid as a real force that is working towards the advancement and proliferation of EVs—a bit like Tesla, but with a different flavor.
Unlike most electric vehicle manufacturers (excluding Tesla), which source key parts from third-party suppliers, Lucid has designed most of its components in-house to work with its novel 900-volt EV architecture.
Having such a high voltage has allowed Lucid to reduce the size of many key components, and it also helps with the efficiency of its vehicles. We were hugely impressed when, in 2022, our own Tom Moloughney exceeded 500 miles in a Lucid Air Dream Edition while driving at a constant 70 mph on the highway, probably one of the most significant range tests we’ve ever done.
The Air could average 4.3 miles/kWh in that test because each of its major components was designed to work together with the utmost efficiency in mind, and it remains unbeaten to this day.
Rawlinson didn’t say when, but he noted that “not far in the future, you can get 10km per kWh and then it’s a 300km range from a 30 kWh battery, which is much smaller than today. Then you can reduce the cost of the battery from $20,000 to around $3000-$4000 with proper industrialization and economies of scale.”
Lucid is also working on a more affordable EV to rival Tesla’s smaller offerings, the Model 3 and Model Y. Rawlinson told us in late 2023 that this $50,000 model would debut around the middle of the decade, but he didn’t mention how efficient it would be. We can speculate that being a smaller vehicle benefiting from EV tech that has advanced a few years since the introduction of the Air, this cheaper Lucid will be one of the most efficient EVs on the market.
Granted, Lucid faces an uncertain future, like many EV startups. The company required a substantial cash injection last year from its majority shareholder, the Private Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. But it hopes that the rollout of the Gravity SUV, and ultimately the smaller and more affordable EV, will help it cross the ""valley of death"" and reach the scale it needs to be stable long-term. The company recently expanded its Arizona factory for exactly that effort.
Whether this plan will achieve Rawlinson’s holy grail remains to be seen, but it’s certainly something exciting for EV enthusiasts to look forward to.

Both for benchmarking purposes?",3/1/2024 14:00,"It appears as though Ford has purchased a Tesla Cybertruck for benchmarking and perhaps teardown purposes. Ford reportedly paid $250,000 for the truck. A price that Elon Musk says was ""worth it.""
It seems automakers are eager to acquire and benchmark the Tesla Cybertruck.
Just this week, both Ford and a Porsche dealer acquired a Tesla Cybertruck for around $250,000, presumably for benchmarking and perhaps teardown purposes.
Sawyer Merrit revealed this reported purchase on X, stating:
Ford just paid $250k for a Cybertruck in the aftermarket and is testing it at its proving grounds near Detroit.
The price Ford paid was similar to what a Porsche dealership dished out earlier this week to purchase a Cybertruck at auction. The dealer reportedly paid $244,000 to acquire the Cybertruck. Rumors suggest it was Porsche who actually bought it but had the dealership make the purchase to perhaps hide the automaker's intent.
Musk commented on Porsche acquiring a Cybetruck too, saying that the automaker needs to up its electric vehicle game to match its ""combustion skills"" and noting that ""When they take it apart, they (Porsche) will discover a lot of new technology.""
The ""new"" technologies are mainly the Cybertruck's 48-volt system and steer-by-wire, both of which are not entirely new but not often seen in the industry.
The Tesla Cybertruck's no-resale clause apparently has not prevented the reselling of Cybertrucks. It's suggested that the workaround here is to pay Tesla $50,000 to sell the truck, but the clause seems to imply that you may owe Tesla more than that:
And here's the clause in its entirety:
If you own a Cybertruck, would you be willing to sell it for $250,000? If not, how high would the offer have to go for you to part ways with your Cybertruck?

'We Are Catching Up': Toyota North America CEO On Where EVs Are Going,https://insideevs.com/news/710807/toyota-north-america-ceo-on-evs/,"But he still thinks EVs will only be 30% of the market in 2030, and Toyota's planning for that.",3/1/2024 13:00,"Without the world’s largest car company, any shift to electric vehicles will likely be incomplete, even if promising start-ups and legacy rivals try to fill the gap. Toyota, which sold 11.3 million vehicles globally last year, is by far the largest automaker by sales volumes. But in recent times, environment advocacy and pro-EV groups have accused it of being slow to accept the urgency of zero-emissions vehicles.
In a recent interview with Automotive News, Toyota Motor North America’s CEO Ted Ogawa reaffirmed the brand’s ""consumer-dependent"" approach to EVs. Ogawa said that Toyota was planning to increase the share of its pure electric car sales, which were just 0.7% in 2023.
Still, the company believes EVs will only be 30% of the U.S. market by 2030. And that figure is far less than the EV market envisioned in Environmental Protection Agency proposals, not to mention the Biden White House's own goals.
Toyota's ""multipath"" approach to electrification.
Toyota has long held the stance of offering customers the choice of hybrids, BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs. Toyota believes in a cautious approach, but environment experts believe otherwise. They say climate urgency requires aggressive EV adoption. If not, it could be too late for the planet to heal.
""I know that EPA is now reconsidering what the regulation level should be. However, again, our starting point is what the customer demand should be. So, for example, 2030 regulations said the new-car market, more than half of it should be BEV, but our current plan is like 30 percent,"" Ogawa told Automotive News. ""We are respecting the regulation, but more important is customer demand.""
Toyota has long been accused of slow-walking and even lobbying against EV adoption, but in this case, it's not alone.
After vigorous lobbying by automakers, dealer groups, and oil companies, the Biden administration is reportedly considering relaxing the EPA rules. In the initial proposal, the EPA required two-thirds of new light-duty passenger car sales to be electric by 2032. An alternative ruling that the EPA might finalize would still require more than 50% EV penetration—again, far lower than what Toyota is gearing up for.
But Ogawa further endorsed Toyota’s stance. He said 2024 would be the “starting year” of Toyota’s plans to truly broaden its plug-in line-up. As per Ogawa, Toyota is ""catching up"" in not only offering more EVs but also in establishing an ecosystem around charging and energy management. He added that his company would continue pursuing a multi-pronged approach. This includes offering consumers the choice of hybrids, BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs.
At last year's Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed a variety of electric concepts, including a sports car, a Land Cruiser, a compact SUV and a truck—some of which seem likely for production. Toyota is also working heavily on solid-state batteries and plans to build a three-row electric SUV in the U.S. that would compete with the Kia EV9 and the like.
Ogawa added that Toyota would respect the upcoming regulations, but more importantly, it would keep an eye on what the customers want. A blanket EV adoption would equal a “wasted investment,” worse than purchasing carbon credits, which is one way entities can offset their carbon emissions, by indirectly funding projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.
The 86-year-old Japanese automaker has manufactured gas-powered and hybrid cars for most of its existence. It pioneered lean manufacturing in the 1980s, which involved streamlining supply-chain, minimizing production errors, maximizing worker efficiency at the assembly line, and reducing costs—something all its major rivals, including American carmakers, ended up adopting.
The upcoming elections and the EPA's final ruling would undoubtedly impact the whole industry. But whether Toyota’s ""multipath"" approach to electrification matches consumer demand or leaves the automaker behind remains to be seen.

A Reminder That China's Electric Car Companies Are Not Invincible,https://insideevs.com/news/710518/hiphi-shutdown-cash-production-pause/,China's HiPhi is shutting down of its factory for six months while it searches for a way to financial solvency. Is this the end for the futuristic EV startup?,2/29/2024 14:30,"As BYD and Geely both jock for EV world domination, it can be easy to assume that all Chinese EV manufacturers are similarly destined for greatness. Actually, the truth is a bit more mixed. Big players like those two are doing well, but China's many, many smaller brands are facing some of the same profitability issues and lackluster sales that face any other EV startup elsewhere in the world.
Take Human Horizons, commonly known as HiPhi Auto, for example. It's not doing so hot. As of right now, the company is shut down for at least six months, and rumors are swirling if it’ll be purchased and resume production.
Not every Chinese EV manufacturer is doing well
BYD and Geely are selling strongly, but not every EV manufacturer is doing well. HiPhi, Chinese a high-end EV manufacturer that also sells in Europe, announced it is stopping production for six months as it has run out of capital to continue on. Chinese automakers are suffering from the same issues with profitability that affect other brands outside of that country.
For those not in the know, HiPhi is a high-end Chinese EV maker. Currently, it produces the HiPhi Z and HiPhi X, two crossover-esque vehicles that wouldn’t look out of place as a car in Cyberpunk 2077. HiPhi has even started to venture outside of China, selling its high-end EV in parts of European markets. It has also started to venture downmarket with the HiPhi Y, a $48,000 EV crossover aimed slightly above the Tesla Model Y.
The HiPhi Y went on sale in China in mid-July 2023, with plans to eventually sell the cheaper car in Europe alongside its higher-priced models.
Unfortunately, it’s not clear if that’ll ever happen. Initially, there were rumblings on Chinese social media about unpaid salaries and canceled year-end employee bonuses in January. But on Feb. 18, the company announced that it was reducing everyone’s salaries to the minimum required by Beijing law, shutting down its factory, and suspending production for six months.
Certainly, this isn’t a great look for HiPhi. But it would be one of the latest startup Chinese EV brands to close up shop.
Byton, a company that promised to bring US drivers a sleek EV SUV, did a six-month furlough in April 2020 only to officially die in 2021. Levdeo, which made the Letin Mengo, failed in May. Weltmeister (aka WM Motor), a brand that was one of the first to the EV crossover craze and even outsold the Tesla Model Y for a split second in time, has yet to rise from the post-bankruptcy restructuring phase that it entered in October.
With that in mind, HiPhi’s break doesn’t necessarily mean the brand is completely doomed, though. Somehow, the brand Hengchi, the EV arm of infamous (and now infamously troubled) Chinese real estate company Evergrande, managed to get its EV crossover back in production after a months-long shutdown. The tooling for Niutron, the EV brand made by electric scooter maker Niu, was ported to one of its manufacturers and renamed to the Docan V07, although it’s not entirely clear if the car has ever gone officially on sale.
Of course, we can’t forget Faraday Future, a brand that has gone through several similar furloughs and layoffs, yet somehow continues to cheat death.
All of this comes at a time when China's once-unstoppable economy is slowing down, or at least normalizing after a period of massive growth. Sales of homes and cars—two important measurements for the health of any economy—have been slowing for a while, for various reasons. It looks to be entering a nasty real estate crisis. And a lot of the government subsidies that drove EV adoption are winding down there, too.
None of this is to say that Western and other Asian markets can underestimate China. They already have, and look where that got them. But it helps to remember this country and its car business have significant headwinds of their own.
As for HiPhi, it's trying to figure out a way to make itself profitable, or at the very least figure out a way to inject its pocketbook with cash. According to reporting from CarNewsChina, the brand is seeking a suitor, as well as looking for a way to reduce some of its financial burdens. Some have speculated the prospects of several companies, anyone from Huawei to Changan.
There has been no official news from HiPhi if there is a deal on the table, but Reportedly, HiPhi CEO Ding Lei has confirmed that he has met with Changan at its HQ in Chongquing.
It would no doubt be kind of sad if this was the end of HiPhi. Editor-in-Chief Patrick George saw a Z in person in Europe last year, and he said “It looks like a cross between a Nissan GT-R and a Gundam, and I mean that as the highest possible compliment.” The HiPhi Z has more than 600 horsepower and could scoot to 60 MPH in less than four seconds, so it certainly had the performance chops to play with the big boys. It even outperformed EV models from established brands in a recent cold weather test.
But as we're seeing with China, great tech alone isn't enough to make you a winner in a very, very crowded market. Couple that with high interest rates globally and markets that are increasingly wary of exports from China, plus China's own economic troubles, and their road to dominance is far from straightforward.
It may even buy some time for the rest of the world to catch up—that is, if they're down to try.

Ford's NACS Fast Charging Adapter Now Available As Tesla Charging Network Opens,https://insideevs.com/news/710517/tesla-supercharger-adapters-online-february/,"Ford EV owners can order their complimentary Tesla NACS to CCS adapters starting today, just as Supercharger access opens up to them.",2/29/2024 9:00,"Everybody knows that the public fast-charging life is just easier when you're a Tesla owner. But starting today, Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E owners will begin to play on their level too as the Tesla Supercharger network opens up to them.
Ford today announced two major developments on the electric front. First, Ford customers can now order the Fast Charging Adapter—the first from a major automaker—that allows Tesla North American Charging Standard (NACS) plugs to link up to the Combined Charging System (CCS) fast-charging port standard on basically all non-Tesla EVs.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
For years, Tesla's proprietary charging network was considered the best—but it was open only to Teslas. Now the rest of the car industry is switching to Tesla's smaller and sleeker plug, and finding ways to grant access to Tesla's stellar charging network. In other words, the charging experience enjoyed by Tesla owners will soon be more open to all kinds of EVs.
Second, both Ford's EVs and the Tesla Supercharger network are receiving over-the-air updates that will enable Ford vehicles to charge at those stations, just like any Tesla can. That adds another 15,000 DC fast chargers for Ford owners as soon as they get their adapters in the mail.
In other words, today marks the beginning of the era where Tesla's Superchargers, which are widely regarded as the most extensive and most reliable public charging network in North America, start to open up to drivers of all kinds of EVs. Soon, other automakers will follow Ford's lead in allowing Tesla charging access via an adapter, and in the years to come nearly all of them will use Tesla's NACS plug format from the factory.
More than 80% of Ford EV owners charge at home, said Ken Williams, Ford's Director of Charging and Energy Services. ""Their main pain point is public charging,"" he said.
Today, that starts to get a lot less painful.
Robert Hayes, Ford's Manager of Public Charging Customer Experience, said that owners can now log into their FordPass account, go to the Connected Service Home Page, click the offer for the free charger, and then receive it in the mail free of charge. They can also do so on Ford's website.
The charger is free until June 30. Starting July 1, it's going to cost $230, which includes taxes and shipping. The adapters are expected to start shipping over the coming weeks.
Ford officials said that the adapter does not have any communication protocols, so in theory, it should work with any EV. But since those EVs may not yet be authenticated to work with Tesla's network, don't expect them to actually charge. Officials added that the adapter is not expected to impact charging speeds or performance. (Neither Ford nor Tesla recommend the use of any third-party adapters, which are increasingly hitting the market but may present safety concerns.)
Thanks to the over-the-air updates, Ford EV owners with the adapter will be able to plug in and charge automatically, without using a credit card onsite; the same convenience Tesla owners enjoy. ""Once owners have created an account and activated Plug & Charge, Tesla Superchargers will support Plug & Charge with Ford EVs,"" Ford officials said. ""This means customers simply have to plug in and charging will automatically start with charges managed through FordPass.""
The native Tesla app is also not needed for the experience. The FordPass app is recommended instead to find compatible chargers and determine charging prices, Hayes said. The Tesla Supercharger system is now the 11th on Ford's Blue Oval Network, which lets Ford owners charge and pay natively without using multiple apps, memberships or on-site payment methods.
Owners of the Ford E-Transit van may have to wait a bit longer because that vehicle will have to be updated at dealerships later to use the plug-and-charge feature.
The other upside to this move is that later this spring, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will offer native route planning to Tesla Supercharger stations from their navigation apps. Ford has been ramping up those features within the popular smartphone projection systems for a while, allowing their navigation systems to tell drivers how much range they'll have at their destination or where to divert and charge if that's necessary; now Tesla's Superchargers will get in on the fun. (And remember, charging route planning is one big reason crosstown rival General Motors cited for dumping Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on its EVs, so this move says a lot.)
Ford stressed that Tesla sets the prices for charging, so it's not immediately clear whether Ford owners will have to pay more for electricity. (Normally, this is where we'd ask Tesla for comment, but the automaker no longer speaks with the press in North America.) Ford officials speculated that charging prices could be similar to what Magic Dock users enjoy, but this is unconfirmed for now.
Ford also added that all of the older V2 Superchargers, which were limited to 150kW charging speeds, are not compatible with this process. But since the faster V3 Superchargers have been around since 2019 and the improved V4 Superchargers began rolling out last year, it may not be too much of an inconvenience.
Finally, Ford confirmed that the adapters are for DC fast-charging only; they do not work with Tesla's NACS-equipped slower destination chargers, which run on AC power.
InsideEVs will know exactly how the Ford Fast Charging Adapter performs in real-world situations when we do a charging test with one in the coming days; stay tuned for that.
Besides delivering a crushing blow to range anxiety for Ford EV owners, these announcements ostensibly begin the era when Tesla's plug—now called the SAE J3400 standard—starts to take over charging in North America. The slimmer, sleeker plug has many advantages over the heavy and unwieldy CCS fast-charging plug, and grants access to Tesla's vast network in the process.
It was Ford that kicked this process off last May by announcing the forthcoming adapters, followed by a move to native NACS plugs from 2025 onward. Over the following months, nearly every other automaker announced it would follow Ford's lead here as they were reportedly fed up with the subpar experiences offered by other charging networks.
So far, charging access—specifically, public fast charging—has proved to be a major barrier to wider EV adoption. While most owners charge at home, they do need fast charging for road trips or when they don't have their own garage. Automakers expected charging networks to just kind of pop up on their own as gas stations did; clearly, that ended up not being the case. Many of them are now finding ways to build their own networks instead.
Opening up Tesla's charging network should help fix some of those challenges, given how ubiquitous, reliable and seamless the experience is. (It also stands to provide Tesla with a massive new revenue source, potentially up to $20 billion by 2030.)
The move won't be some magic bullet for Ford EV owners, however. For one, it's going to take time to see if the cars and the chargers have any software compatibility issues. Lines at Tesla Supercharger stations are probably due to get longer as more EVs can juice up there, although new ones are being added all of the time.
But with any luck, this marks a new era for the standardization and maturity of the North American EV charging experience. That will be even more apparent once the cars use the Tesla plug format from the factory as well. For now, Ford's EV owners can count on fewer headaches when they're on the road.

"American Test Of $11,500 BYD Seagull: 'This Doesn't Come Across Cheap'",https://insideevs.com/news/710364/byd-detroit-import-seagull-caresoft/,"The imported EV hatchback may only cost $11,500 but it impressed industry veteran John McElroy.",2/27/2024 19:21,"China has put everyone on notice, but you probably already knew that by now. European, Japanese, and American automakers have struggled to sell their EV shapes at a reasonable price, without sacrificing any semblance of profitability. Meanwhile, cheap and cheerful Chinese-branded EVs have only continued to proliferate across the globe, reaching price parity with ICE cars without destroying profit.
Seeking to figure out how the heck Chinese OEMs do it, Detroit-area Automotive benchmarking company Caresoft imported an $11,500 BYD Seagull for analysis. With it, automotive journalist veteran John McElroy and Terry Woychowski, the president of Caresoft, are left significantly impressed.
“This doesn't come across as cheap,” Woychowski said.
The BYD Seagull Is An Immense Success
The BYD Seagull has been an incredible success for the Chinese brand. Officially launched in China in April 2023, the brand had produced a stunning 200,000 units by the start of December of the same year. With a base price of roughly $10,000 and a range of up to 250 miles (on the CLTC standard), it's little wonder why the small cheap car has been so popular.
The video begins with the two analyzing the exterior of the vehicle, as Woychowski calls out some of the probable cost-saving measures BYD took to manufacture the Seagull. For example, the Seagull only has one mono wiper for the entire vehicle, and it is on the front. There is no rear wiper, which means that BYD only has to manufacture one wiper arm, one wiper motor, and one wiper blade, driving down costs.
Similarly, the two presenters remarked on BYD’s knack for vertical integration. Not much, if anything, on the Seagull is outsourced to a third-party supplier. Body panels, light clusters, motors, batteries, power electronics, and more are all made in-house, by BYD itself.
But some of the real masterful manufacturing that Woychowski gushes over is how some of the vehicle's spot welds, particularly at the rear trunk portal area, are exceptionally neat. According to Woychowski, it doesn’t like BYD’s factories had issues trying to get the panels in place. Also, because the welds are good-looking, they won’t need to be hidden with trim, saving costs.
The video is McElroy and Woychowski impressed by the Seagull’s perceived quality and immense value. Coming in under $12 grand, the Seagull offers a lot of utility and equipment for not much price. This test vehicle came with a (synthetic) leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, a power driver’s seat, and a surprisingly high amount of soft-touch surfaces. McElroy was impressed with the driving experience. With a mere 75 horsepower or so, it’s not lightning-fast, but it is adequate.
This imported Seagull wasn’t made to pass U.S. crash standards, but Woychowski did mention that BYD as a whole is altering its model lineup to sell in Europe and beyond. BYD has already made significant alterations to the Dolphin, adding a bigger nose for improved crash performance.
This just once again shows how far China and BYD have come in the global automotive race. I can second McElroy’s opinions, although I haven’t driven a BYD Seagull, I was able to get behind the wheel of a BYD Atto 3 while in Paris a short while ago. I was similarly gobsmacked with how good the vehicle was. The driving experience was pleasant, and the car’s construction felt remarkably neat.
Like McElroy, I understood why so many consumers are buying BYDs and the like. Chinese cars have reached the point where they’re purchased on merit, and not necessarily because they’re cheap. Those facts mean that Chinese EVs inherently are an existential threat to every other automaker.
Caresoft’s BYD Seagull will be taken apart, studied, and benchmark-tested. Soon, we’ll have a better understanding of how BYD was able to make this car so cheap, and if it’s even possible for other automakers.

"The Apple Car Is Finally Dead, Shrouded In Mystery Until The End: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/710352/apple-car-dead-project-titan/,"After a decade and a reported $1 billion spent annually, Apple's infamous ""Project Titan"" couldn't survive the tech layoff apocalypse.",2/27/2024 15:05,"For years, it was believed to be the biggest game-changer the automotive sector had ever seen—beyond any Tesla or any other startup's effort. But after a decade that was marked with uncertainty, reported infighting over its purpose and a rumored $1 billion spent annually on development, the Apple Car effort is said to be finally dead, Bloomberg reported today.
Instead, some of the Apple employees involved with the car effort—known as Project Titan—will be shuffled over to something considerably hotter at the moment: generative AI projects, according to Bloomberg.
The Apple Car Project was a mystery until the end
Many critics said Apple had no business developing a car. That included auto industry executives, even as Apple poached many of them. Today, the car's exact design and purpose remains a mystery, although both are said to have changed many times over the past decade.
The news wire reports the move came as ""a surprise"" to more than 2,000 employees working on it, not all of whom might keep their jobs. And that decision by Apple also arrives at a time when the entire tech sector is exacting brutal layoffs; for months, thousands of employees at Meta, Google and other companies have lost their jobs amid high interest rates and wider belt-tightening.
Just a few weeks ago, the car was said to be in a ""make or break moment"" as executives weighed what to do with it, and the employees behind it. Most recently, Project Titan was said to be an electric vehicle with a price tag around $100,000 and some automated driving assistance functions, but not full autonomy.
In other words, Apple went ""break"" with Project Titan, not ""make.""
From 2024's vantage point, it's hard to fathom just how big a deal the Apple Car was a decade earlier.
In the years after the death of Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs, the tech titan sought to make a name for itself by breaking into the automotive world with a software-driven and presumably electric effort long before those concepts were in the mainstream. By virtue of Apple being Apple, the car was regarded by many as a potentially massive game-changer—something that could reset the order of things just like the iPhone did for personal communications and connectivity.
After all, why not? On top of Apple's own tech might, the company poached top talent from across the car industry and its related fields, including veterans of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Ford, Samsung and others. At one point, this helped fuel rumors that Apple might buy Tesla outright. (To give one example of what a big deal this one, Motor Trend ""designed"" one and put it on a magazine cover in 2016.)
But problems arose almost from the start. While it made sense for the company behind Apple CarPlay to want to get more involved in the software-driven car revolution, there was considerable debate from within as to whether Project Titan would yield a passenger car for consumers, a robotaxi and accompanying service, or some combination of the two. At one point, developers even acquired an old Fiat Jolly, for reasons that remain unknown.
Yet years of development hell resulted in setbacks, delays, secrecy, fights with other automakers, high-profile departures, layoffs, failed partnership attempts, and still no clear idea of what an Apple Car would even be or do. By the early 2020s, the project was still said to be trudging along, albeit with few new developments.
Things seemed to be changing fairly recently, however. The Washington Post reported some Apple autonomous driving tests in California just a few weeks ago, leading many to wonder what Apple had up its sleeve in the transportation department. (And for all we know, whatever that testing was much lead to something else car-related.) But today, the dream seems dead for real—shunted into the past so Apple can focus on the hottest new thing in tech, which is AI.
In the end, did the world need a whole car from Apple? It seems like a safer play would always be to stay in its software lane, perfecting something automakers consistently struggle with. That certainly seems to be the plan for the more all-encompassing future versions of CarPlay.
But it's hard to know what we all were missing out on here because we never knew much about it to begin with. Over more than 10 years, it lived and then died as ""a car, but from Apple,"" and the rest is probably only known to those who are NDA'd to hell and back. It remains the greatest mystery in cars—and tech, too—that no one has ever really figured out yet.

Hyundai Confirms Its Georgia 'Metaplant' EV Factory Is Opening Early,https://insideevs.com/news/710346/hyundai-metaplant-schedule-2024/,"As other automakers fret over demand, Hyundai Motor Group is ahead of schedule on its EV factory.",2/27/2024 13:30,"If you think every automaker is in retreat mode on electric vehicles after a couple of slower months, think again. Korea's Hyundai Motor Group, which proved last year that it's a force to be reckoned with in the EV world, has no intention of slowing down this year. The Kia EV9 is already on sale and receiving rave reviews, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 can be had with outstanding deals, and the Ioniq 7 three-row crossover will be revealed this summer.
And in an even better bit of news, Hyundai yesterday confirmed that its Georgia ""Metaplant""—a super factory devoted to EVs, batteries and powertrain components for them—will actually open later this year, ahead of schedule.
Huge EV investments are being made in America
Spurred by the tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and eager to offer tax breaks on cars made in North America, the EV revolution is bringing scores of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.
The Metaplant near Savannah is slated to open in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a ""grand opening"" ceremony in the first quarter of 2025, company officials said yesterday. Previously, the plant was slated to open in 2025. This announcement, which the automaker alluded to last year, came at the ""Hyundai Day"" celebration at Georgia's state capitol.
There, company officials were flanked by Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia's First Lady, along with a row of EVs and the hydrogen-powered XCIENT Fuel Cell Truck.
Georgia has reason to be happy with the Korean automaker. The Metaplant is a $7.59 billion investment (on top of the $5 billion EV battery cell plant in Bartow County, Georgia built with SK On) that's said to create 8,500 new jobs. The state is said to have provided $1.8 billion in incentives, including tax breaks, to create what will be one of the Hyundai Motor Group's biggest EV manufacturing ecosystems for decades to come.
A Hyundai USA spokesperson told InsideEVs that the plant will build Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models, but it has not announced which ones yet. It feels like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would be a reasonable bet, alongside the Genesis GV60; all of those E-GMP platform EVs are excellent but none are made in North America, so they do not qualify for any U.S. tax credits unless they are leased. (Kia Georgia’s West Point assembly plant is due to make the EV9 later this year, positioning it to get at least some tax credits eventually.)
Hyundai, Genesis and Kia all have huge, global plans for EVs. In Kia's case, that also means EV production across eight global bases by 2025, including Georgia. And if they make some already good models even cheaper for Americans to buy, going hard and fast with those plant investments should pay off nicely.

Electrification Leads To All-Wheel-Drive Dominance,https://insideevs.com/news/710128/electrification-leads-awd-dominance/,75% of EV configurations are all-wheel drive.,2/26/2024 16:00,"When analyzing the all-electric vehicle (EV) market, we have noticed that the segment shifted towards all-wheel-drive (AWD) powertrains. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) and rear-wheel-drive (RWD) models are in the minority.
It wasn't always like that though. Between 2010 and 2013, there were only single-motor FWD and RWD models on the market. Things changed in the 2014 model year when Tesla introduced a dual-motor AWD version of the Model S (85D).
In the 2015 model year, Tesla expanded the dual-motor family to a few versions (about a quarter of all versions on the market, at the time), and then doubled the AWD lineup with the newly launched Model X in the 2016 model year.
We had to wait until the 2018 model year to see the AWD Tesla Model 3, and until the 2019 model year to see the first non-Tesla, dual-motor, AWD model: the Audi e-tron SUV and Jaguar I-Pace. At the time, the share of AWD accounted for about half of all EV configurations.
The AWD domination progressed, initially through premium/high-performance models. However, later, the mainstream models started to get all-wheel drive versions too.
In the 2023 model year, we saw the first tri-motor, all-wheel drive EVs—the Audi e-tron S, which was equipped with one electric motor in the front, and two separate electric motors in the rear. Meanwhile, Rivian introduced its quad-motor, all-wheel drive powertrain in R1T and R1S models (one motor per wheel).
Having a dual-motor AWD system helps with traction and performance, and has some benefits related to regenerative braking. The tri-motor or quad-motor versions can improve performance further through torque vectoring of particular wheels.
There are drawbacks as well, in the form of complexity, cost and weight. Efficiency is also slightly compromised, thus single-motor models are at the top of the energy consumption ranking. It might also be difficult to fit two independent motors in the front because it's the steering axle.
The dual-motor system is the simplest and most cost-effective ""good-enough"" way to achieve all-wheel drive. We also believe that it's ""easier"" or more ""native"" if you wish, to develop an AWD EV with two electric motors than an internal combustion engine vehicle with AWD.
There are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels. According to our data, roughly three-quarters (some 250), or 75% of them are all-wheel drive.
In the case of front-wheel drive configurations, there are only about 30 of them (less than 9%). Rear-wheel drive configurations account for nearly a 17% share (56 configurations).
These numbers do not automatically mean that sales of AWD vehicles represent 75%—this is the number of configurations—but it seems that electrification transforms the car market towards AWD.
We will see whether this trend will continue, because obviously, the single-motor cars should be less expensive and many companies are now working on more affordable models. There might be a new wave of FWD/RWD models and their sales might be higher than AWD several years from now.

Auto Industry Begs U.S. To Block 'Cheap' Chinese EV Imports From Mexico,https://insideevs.com/news/710108/byd-jeep-rivian-ev-sales/,"Plus: what's next in the EV race from Jeep, and how Rivian can cross ""the valley of death.""",2/26/2024 9:30,"See that ship in the lead image? It's one of those giant car-carrying ships that Chinese automaker BYD  is chartering on its own because the other shipping companies aren't able to meet its voracious export demands. And soon enough, BYD will be able to just truck those cars across the border to America once its long-rumored Mexican factory is open for business. That outcome is what industry lobbyists are about to try and thwart.
That kicks off this Monday edition of our Critical Materials news roundup. Also on tap today: Jeep tweaks its own EV plans in the U.S. market, and Rivian has a year ahead where it must cross the ""valley of death."" And no, that's not an off-roading thing. Let's dig in.
Right now, the biggest thing keeping you from being able to buy a super cheap but surprisingly high-tech Chinese EV like a $10,000 BYD Seagull is the fact that the U.S. has 27.5% import tariffs on cars made there. (Some vehicles are sold here with the tariff in place, like the Polestar 2 and the upcoming Volvo EX30, but examples are few and far between.) But nothing is stopping automakers like BYD from getting around that tariff by making cars in Mexico; in fact, they'd even theoretically qualify for tax breaks up to $7,500 per car because they're made in North America.
The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade group that represents several manufacturing sectors here, calls this an ""existential threat"" to the U.S. economy. In a new report issued Friday and first covered by Reuters, they are calling on some significant policy changes to cut China off before it can make inroads into the U.S. via our neighbor (and top trading partner) to the south. From their report:
We have already seen in steel and aluminum industries what happens when unfairly traded imports are allowed to swamp the U.S. market: Job losses, bankruptcies and deindustrialization. It has taken some de-industrialized communities decades to revitalize. Others continue to struggle. The domestic auto industry, with its millions of American workers and intricate ties to hundreds of other industries, is integral to American manufacturing. It is simply too important to the country’s economic security to be exposed to such blatantly unfair competition.
The commercial backdoor left open to Chinese auto imports should be shut before it causes mass plant closures and job losses in the United States. Washington should undertake the following policy recommendations to preempt their entry.
They recommend a number of things, including exclusionary tariffs on all Chinese automobile imports into the U.S. regardless of origin; enforcing tougher rules under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor to NAFTA; excluding ""companiesheadquartered in a non-market economy"" from the USMCA terms; and keeping Chinese companies from accessing taxpayer-funded research in the U.S.
How serious a threat is all of this? Today, Business Insider has a big feature diving into the whole thing, and it puts it into very stark terms, emphasis mine below:
""The thought that Chinese-quality engineering and design are not as high quality as the legacy carmakers — that should be put to bed,"" Tu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy focusing on the Chinese EV market, told me. ""Right now, the legacies don't have competitive products. There's a vacuum. If China EV Inc. were allowed to enter the US today or next year, the legacies would be gutted.""
We are witnessing a shock to the global automotive order unseen since Japan barreled into the market in the 1970s. China's EV ascendance has sparked a fight that is forcing companies to stretch the limits of their technological capability and policymakers to reimagine the ideological underpinnings of decades of trade strategy. What's at stake is nothing less than a US industry worth $104 billion, about as much as Angola's national GDP, and all the 3 million jobs that come with it.
""It's a global game. It has been a global game,"" Le said. ""Motherfuckers just haven't been paying attention.""
America has certainly fired back with import tariffs and restrictions on foreign competition before, but this is on a different level—and aimed very specifically at China. Granted, doing so could spark a trade war with China if that country decides to turn the screws in a different way in retaliation. But everyone from Elon Musk to executives at Ford and Stellantis are calling China a grave and unprecedented threat to the U.S. auto industry, so it may be a risk politicians are willing to take.
One huge problem with the EV market in America is that the things are still widely regarded as too expensive for a permanent wave of mass adoption—yes, even with the tax incentives and copious dealer discounts. There are a lot of reasons for this. Rising interest rates and inflation are one. But another is that the U.S. auto industry (and you can include the ""import"" brands in this too) have become addicted to high-price, high-margin trucks and SUVs financed over eight, nine or 10 years. It can't compete on cheap cars anymore because it barely offers them.
This has especially hit the Jeep brand in recent years; it tried to go ""upmarket"" on its SUVs and customers didn't really respond. Jeep's sales were even down 6% last year in the U.S., which is not good.
So as Jeep seeks to deploy EVs for the first time—the Jeep Wagoneer S and Jeep Recon—it needs to reevaluate pricing across the board, Antonio Filsosa, the brand’s new CEO, said on Friday. Here's The Detroit News:
""We need to do something on market penetration and market share, because it's not where this brand deserves to be,"" Filosa said during a roundtable with reporters at the automaker's North American headquarters. ""The perception of the brand is fantastic, and we have survey data that never has been so strong.""
Lineup adjustments affect about 90% of its sales. Jeep has added more than $3,000 in content to the flagship Jeep Wrangler off-roader as well as the refreshed ’24 Gladiator midsize pickup, whose manufacturer’s suggested retail price is $1,700 lower this week starting at $38,990. The Jeep Compass crossover, now the brand’s entry-level model in the United States after discontinuing the Renegade in the market, starts at $25,900 with a $2,500 lower MSRP. The Grand Cherokee, Jeep’s best-selling offering, is as much as $4,000 lower starting at $36,495.
[...] EVs also could be an opportunity to grow market share if Jeep's 4xe plug-in hybrid success is any indication. The Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xes are the best-selling PHEVs in the United States, securing more than half of PHEV sales. Ninety percent of those customers, Filosa said, are conquests.
""We need those models to be along with our consumers,"" he said of the EVs. ""It's a consumer-based strategy, not regulation-based.""
This reminds me of when Ford looked at slowing F-150 Lightning sales last year and declared that the rules have changed. It's not enough for these automakers to keep doing the same things they've always done in the electric transition, at the same prices, and just expect customers to show up—certainly not until charging gets better across the board, anyway.
Several of the EV startups—Rivian, Lucid and Fisker—have slightly different versions of the same problem in 2024. They launched with their most expensive models to gin up cash, and next, they want to use that cash and investor capital to scale up for more mass-production models—and hope that customers show up. The space between those things is often called the ""EV valley of death.""
Electric truck maker Rivian is in that spot too. I think it's doing better, and has more potential, than other startups in the field, but this year is going to be tough until it can start selling the smaller and more affordable R2 in volume. Here are our friends at climate site Heatmap News to explain:
Claire McDonough, Rivian’s chief financial officer and a former J.P. Morgan director, has a plan for crossing that canyon — an aptly if strangely named “bridge to profitability” that it will attempt to build this year. Rivian’s survival, she said, will depend above all on cutting the unit costs of producing its vehicles, including by using fewer materials to make every car. Other savings will come from making more vehicles faster. That’s what makes the shutdown plan, though it might seem extreme, worth it; McDonough said those improvements alone will get the company about 80% of the way to profitability.
Another 15% will come from marketing more “software-enabled products” to Rivian drivers and by selling air-pollution credits to other carmakers, whose vehicles are not as climate-friendly. This is a tried-and-true technique; Tesla first turned a profit in 2021 by selling regulatory credits needed to comply with federal and California state-level rules to other, dirtier automakers. But that same year, Tesla also debuted an entirely new vehicle: the Model Y crossover, which quickly became its top seller in the United States. Tesla, in other words, finally started to make money by cutting costs, finding new revenue sources, and releasing new products.
New products, however, are becoming a weak point for Rivian. The company says that high interest rates will keep demand for its vehicles flat this year. It expects to make about 60,000 of them, about 20,000 fewer than what it had once anticipated. The Rivian R1S, a three-row S.U.V., has become the company’s flagship; it is selling better and is cheaper to manufacture than Rivian’s pickup, the R1T. It also costs at least $75,000, or nearly $600 a month to lease. The highest-tier models can cost $99,000. Turns out, it’s difficult to sell a lot of $70,000 trucks when even the cheapest new-car loans hover around 6%.
Rivian announced layoffs last week, citing high interest rates that led to projections of flat sales for most of 2024. Does it have what it takes to make it?
On one hand, we have dealer groups and industry lobbyists begging the White House to ""slow down"" on emissions rules that will lead to wider EV adoption, and that could push back more EV models and further R&D. On the other hand, they realize they're pretty outclassed by China at the moment and asking to keep those cars out of the U.S. market.
Can the business have it both ways here? How far does protectionism go to actually protect before it makes you technologically behind?

Expert To Dealers: Embrace EVs Or Lose Your Jobs,https://insideevs.com/news/709026/how-dealers-can-embrace-evs/,"Analysts agree that rolling back EV policies would be unacceptable, and dealers need to do more to embrace EVs.",2/23/2024 15:00,"Despite the threats posed by climate change, the U.S. remains deeply divided on electric cars. A J.D. Power report from 2023 suggested that even in the long term, electric cars will constitute only a small percentage of new vehicle sales in dozens of U.S. states. Whereas in states like California, Colorado, and New York, EVs are on track to comprise the majority of new sales by 2035. One of the biggest drivers of this division is car dealers.
Of the roughly 17,000 car dealers in the U.S., about 30% have formally urged President Biden to “hit the brakes” on EVs. His administration announced last week that he intends to slow down the EPA regulations. One of their pressure tactics is writing letters to the president—two have been written so far and signed by thousands of dealers—demanding a pushback against the EPA’s proposed rules that mandate two-thirds of new light-duty vehicle sales to be electric by 2032.
While some concerns surrounding range anxiety and inadequate and unreliable charging infrastructure are true, the argument against hitting the brakes on EVs contradicts the urgency posed by climate change.
America's EV transition has a dealer problem.
Nearly one-third of U.S. car dealers are urging President Biden to stop the EPA from implementing its strict upcoming emissions standards. However, experts think dealers could play a bigger role in the climate movement by systemically embracing EVs.
After President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act in 2021 and 2022, the groundwork was laid for the U.S. to move toward EVs, with hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to establish a local supply chain and ecosystem. However, experts say that successful EV adoption requires more than just policy support. They stress the need to reinvent how dealers sell cars and the pivotal role they can play in promoting them, which could lead to fewer political, socio-economic, and cultural divisions around EVs and accelerate decarbonization.
Tu Le, the managing director of market research and management consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, told InsideEVs that leveraging EV technology was a great tool at the dealers' disposal to drive EV sales. “[U.S.] car dealers should shift their attention towards being brand stewards and using the technology to get more folks in the showroom,” Le said. He added that sales reps need to think of EVs as less of a threat to their jobs, and more of how they could contribute to the larger goal of reducing emissions.
Certain temporary roadblocks can indeed be dealbreakers for consumers. The fear of getting stranded with a dead battery in the middle of nowhere, software hiccups, or out-of-order charging dispensers can be major headaches. But the industry is trying to solve these issues. Leveraging the technology now could help consumers adopt it in the long run. Let's face it, the advantages of EVs are remarkable: lower operating costs and carbon footprint, better energy efficiency, explosive off-the-line performance, etc. If dealers believe in the tech, their customers will follow suit.
""Dealer groups and sales reps look at the OEMs wanting to use the technology to replace them and that's certainly true in some cases but it's time to re-negotiate the dealer-OEM relationship.” He continued, “[dealers should] reinforce the brand promise, and product positioning and continue to build that trust and excitement [in what they are selling].” In reality, it seems like dealer groups are building anything but trust. And that fear-mongering could trickle down to customers.
The National Association of Dealers has vowed “to get the president to bend this policy in a more realistic direction.” It's something the Biden administration seems on track to do this election year to garner more voter support. The Alliance For Automotive Innovation (AAI), representing 42 car brands including General Motors and Ford along with dozens of suppliers, has said that the EPA’s goals are “neither reasonable nor achievable in the timeframe provided.”
Consequently, the EPA has tremendous pressure to revise its proposed guidelines. An EPA spokesperson told InsideEVs, “The draft final rulemaking titled ‘The Multi Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles’ is currently in the interagency review process. EPA has received more than 250,000 public comments for the proposed rulemaking and the Agency will address those comments as part of the final rule.”
The EPA refused to comment on the final ruling, but the Biden administration has signaled that it intends to relax the rules until 2030 and make them stricter from there on, the New York Times reported.
Environment groups think any rolling back of policy would exacerbate public health problems caused due to vehicle emissions. Katherine Garcia, the director of the Clean Transportation For All campaign at the non-profit Sierra Club, told me, “Slowing down the policies would be unacceptable. Voting down the policies would be a disservice to Americans. We need to act on climate now. We need to make sure that we are protecting public health.”
Sierra Club and dozens of other environment and clean transportation groups under the umbrella of what's called the Auto Accountability Coalition have written a sign-on letter to the AAI to forego ""obstructive anti-climate lobbying efforts"" and support the EPA's proposed mandates.
However, unlike the dealers, AAI adds greater nuance to its argument. Regardless of the alliance's position, its members are forging ahead with new mass-market EVs and domestic battery manufacturing plants. Currently, the rules propose that 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales be electric by 2032. The AAI recommends that the figure be 40% to 50% by 2030, including BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs. It also recommends the EPA align President Biden's goals with California's LEV IV standards for “criteria pollutants.”
The California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) LEV IV standards focus on removing specific hazardous pollutants from the air as opposed to imposing a blanket EV mandate. The standards include reducing nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gases, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide emissions in a phased manner. The regulations set limits on the amount of these pollutants that vehicles can emit, with progressively tightening rules over time.
Regardless of where the EPA lands with its final ruling, the dealers are inextricably intertwined in this puzzle. If American dealers have to replicate even a small percentage of China or Norway’s success, they’d have to work with manufacturers and policymakers to embrace EVs. “It takes a combination of dealers and a strong online presence to attract customers to the [legacy] OEMs' products. The ones who can crack that code will be much better off,” Le said.
He suggested that there are currently ""too many"" dealerships in the U.S. and that it's the correct time to ""right size."" However, he warned that refusing to embrace EVs would be detrimental to their survival. “[the dealers] aren't a very innovative bunch, but that's because they haven't had to be and from their pleas to Biden, they are kicking and screaming about having to sell a 'new' product that they say people don't want.”

Le's last point regarding consumers not wanting EVs has caused a quagmire in the industry. 2023 was a record year with 1.2 million EV sales in the U.S. Experts disagree on the slowdown narrative.
When I asked Andrew Cornelia, the CEO of Mercedes High Power Charging about what he thought of the “slowdown” during a roundtable with reporters, he said, “The number of different EVs that are coming to market year-over-year and the consumer demand and feedback are leading indicators [of sales].” He added, “We will continue to see growth within the market. The ‘slowdown’ is a zeitgeist that is biased and incorrect.”
Le indicated that the dealers needed to be more in sync with what the product offers, and what the policy intends to achieve. “Isn't that the entire point of a dealer? To convince a consumer to buy X or Y product?” he questioned. “They need to become far more customer-focused. Embrace the technology to make your job easier or it'll likely go away,” Le concluded.",Suvrat Kothari
Scout Motors Aims To Help Volkswagen Do What It's Never Done: Conquer America,https://insideevs.com/news/709267/scout-motors-factory-groundbreaking-vw/,"Company executives tell InsideEVs about the Scout SUV platform, plans for batteries and dealerships, and the ""electric slowdown.""",2/20/2024 13:30,"The forest site in Blythewood, South Carolina currently being cleared to make room for Scout Motors’ future electric truck and SUV factory is a very big deal on multiple fronts.
It’s the largest development the region has ever seen, estimated to bring some 4,000 jobs to produce 200,000 vehicles annually all for a projected $4.2 billion economic impact. It’s another feather in South Carolina’s manufacturing cap, following Volvo and BMW and turning the state into a burgeoning carmaking powerhouse.
And for Scout Motors’ parent company, the Volkswagen Group, it’s nothing short of a coup d'état; not just the revival of an iconic American brand, but a ground-up effort to make vehicles designed and engineered for Americans.
None of this gravity is lost on Scott Keogh, the fast-talking New York native picked to lead the effort. The last time I saw Keogh, he was the Volkswagen Group’s American CEO, and he was showing me the then-new ID.4—another car crucial to both VW’s electric goals and expansion in the U.S. market.
But as important as the ID.4 is, it’s almost a drop in the bucket compared to the impact Scout Motors hopes to make when the trucks enter production in late 2026.
“At the end of the day, ID.4 was a product, a product we loved,” Keogh told me at the factory groundbreaking last week. “Here, we’re starting from a completely blank slate.”

A blank slate may be exactly what the Volkswagen Group needs as it attempts to become an all-electric automaker while reckoning with intense competition from China’s automakers on its home turf, and the fact that it’s never really cracked the American car market the way it’s wanted to.
That last part is exactly what Scout Motors aims to fix.
The original Scout was an SUV before SUVs were even a thing. Built by Illinois-based heavy equipment manufacturer International Harvester between 1960 and 1980, it predated famous 4x4s like the Ford Bronco by years and remains immensely popular with off-road enthusiasts and classic car collectors even today.
After acquiring International Harvester’s successor company Navistar in 2020, the VW Group found itself in possession of the Scout trademark. That got the wheels turning: what could be done with this famous brand? Executives in Germany “wanted a bigger presence in North America,” Keogh said, “and Scout had that credibility.”
To prove the Scout brand was up for the task, Keogh and other members of the Scout team brought board members to an airport hangar divided into three sections. Each had a different focus, including a lesson in the brand’s U.S. heritage and some early scale models—and, crucially, a business plan. Whatever they said in that hangar, it worked. “There was excitement, and it just rolled from there,” Keogh said.
That excitement yielded one of the most ambitious plans the company has ever executed, but it may be a necessary one.
The VW Group is the second-biggest carmaker on the planet behind Toyota, but that isn’t something we see in the U.S. The company commands some 25% of the new car market in Europe and 14% in China; in North America, that number is only about 4%.
Though VW has been here longer than any other “import” brand, and the VW Group sees handsome sales and profits from luxury divisions like Audi, Porsche and Bentley, it has never made the kind of cars Americans buy in volume—namely, big, capable trucks and SUVs.
A more watered-down version of the Scout might have yielded a sub-brand for Volkswagen, or a re-bodied ID.4 with some retro-truck flavor. But the company decided that wasn’t enough, and instead, Scout Motors had to be a kind of startup effort inside the VW Group: a new factory designed to take advantage of U.S. tax incentives, and a new body-on-frame truck platform built from scratch.
While Scout Motors will share considerable know-how, resources and some parts from its VW Group cousins, it is a new and independent effort. (For context around that 200,000 annual production goal, the Volkswagen brand sold about 329,000 cars in the U.S. last year.)
All of that ambition rides on a vehicle no one has seen yet, aside from some cursory sketches, and whose specs remain completely unknown. Keogh told InsideEVs that the Scout models could start in the high-$40,000 range, but otherwise they remain an enigma until their debut this summer.
But Keogh gave some hints in Blythewood: “This car, this platform, this everything was designed to compete here,” he said.
To do so, they wanted to build a proper SUV with off-roading credentials that lived up to the Scout name. “We're not building something to navigate the strip malls of America, we're building something to navigate America,” Keogh said. (He did later that potential exports to markets like China are a possibility as production ramps up.)
That off-road capability like you get in the Bronco or Jeep Wrangler—except powered by batteries, here—was key for Scout Motors. That’s why it’s slated to have locking differentials, tons of accessories at launch and actual, physical buttons instead of screen controls.
VW also tapped contract firm Magna Steyr, longtime maker of the Mercedes G-Class, to make something off-road-ready; that goal was also why modifying an existing electric platform didn’t work.
“We obviously gave this a lot of debate,” Keogh said of the plan to go body-on-frame. “We want to build something that's highly robust and highly capable. And I think Scouts came from that, so we thought it was smart to say, let's keep that integrity.” The result should be something like one of Rivian’s EVs, or the F-150 Lightning; it also will not be offered as a hybrid, even as VW has mulled releasing some of those stateside.
""This is not a twin, or a brother, or daughter to any of the other platforms that we've ever had,"" added Jan Spies, Scout Motors’ head of production and a longtime VW Group manufacturing executive.
That goes for the factory as well. Spies said the plant will pioneer various technologies and techniques that could be used across the rest of the conglomerate. When compared to existing factories that had to be converted for the era of “electromobility,” as Spies put it, this one is more designed from the get-go with environmental sustainability in mind.
“When it comes to innovation today, we think it's about making it workable for the next 20, 30 years,” Spies said. “We're here in a state where for example, water is not yet a resource that is counted as much as maybe in Mexico… but it will be one day.”
But many questions have to be answered in the next 2.5 years, provided the Scout Motors vehicles don’t face any delays.
For one, it is not known where the cars will source batteries from. Keogh said they won’t come from the SK Innovation plant in Georgia that supplies power cells to the Volkswagen ID.4, saying “they won’t work for a host of reasons I won’t get into.” In theory, the company may have its choice of suppliers as local battery production scales up across North America.
The company’s sales strategy is another unknown. It’s going to have dealerships, Keogh said, but they will not be attached to existing Volkswagen stores. He added during the roundtable discussion that future decisions on sales will be released later.
One can assume some Scout dealerships may end up attached to VW stores, but that won't happen by default. Furthermore, it feels unlikely a Volkswagen Group company would dip into some version of direct-to-consumer sales like Tesla and Rivian; doing so would likely draw the ire of their existing dealers. (Those VW dealers have already expressed some consternation since Scout Motors will be selling the kinds of trucks they have wanted to sell for years.)
Arguably a bigger question for Scout Motors may be what the EV market looks like in 2026. Last week’s factory groundbreaking ceremony came after a year of record electric sales in America, but one marked by a slowdown in recent months. Moreover, the president whose policies pushed EV adoption may not be in the White House in two years.
“We’re not naive to the headlines,” Keogh said. He added that the challenge of moving EVs in volume comes down to three things: costs, infrastructure and technology, meaning range, charging times and software. But he sees all three improving, even now.
“I think these three things are gonna line up quite well,” he said. “In my mind, I don't think salvation means, let's go let's go back, back, back. I think salvation is gonna come from constantly innovating and getting better technology. I’m an optimist on technology, and I’m an optimist on American technology.”

Japan's Automakers Shift Into Crisis Mode Over The EV Race,https://insideevs.com/news/709240/japan-evs-critical-materials/,"Also, Ford sounds the alarm on China too, and Scout is looking for cheaper batteries.",2/19/2024 10:21,"I was born in the 1980s, so for most of my life, it felt like all the best stuff was made in Japan. The most advanced electronics, the coolest video games and certainly the best cars. But the recession of the 1990s, the devastating earthquake in the early 2010s and a series of industry-wide technological choices have left Japan's auto industry scrambling to get ready for the electric vehicle future, despite being early pioneers in that field. Don't think the so-called EV sales slowdown is changing that situation one bit.
Plus, we hear more about how Ford is sounding the alarm over China, and the Volkswagen Group's new Scout Motors brand is looking for cheap batteries. You'll find all of those stories on today's Presidents' Day edition of our Critical Materials news roundup.
(Fun fact: George Washington never once drove an electric car. Really makes you think.)
Sure, the Japanese automakers—Toyota in particular—may be spiking the football over the slowing rate of EV adoption and hugely successful year of hybrid sales in 2023. But they aren't stupid. Far from it. America's fast-growing EV market is one thing, but what has them really spooked is their eroding market share in China and that country's homegrown EV industry getting into the export game in force.
Basically, everyone's gangster until BYD sets up a factory in your preferred backyard.
So what does Japan do here? Automotive News says a plan is forming among the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, a powerful lobbying group representing the big automakers (Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi.) And they want some government help to do it.
It's easy to balk at that, but EV growth has certainly been helped along by U.S. tax incentives and initiatives, and China's government basically bankrolled that stuff for years. If a government wants to protect one of its most important industries and employment sectors, it has to invest and get protectionist.
For Japan, that means extra collaboration among rivals; building up a local battery and semiconductor industry; and expanding green energy sources, because the country is inherently wary of plug-in cars after the Fukushima nuclear disaster showed both the weaknesses of its grid and drove a pivot back to fossil fuel power sources. From that story:
This year, new labor regulations restrict the work hours of truck drivers. Combined with an overall labor shortage, this pinches Japan's finely tuned just-in-time production system. Automakers are looking to alleviate the shortage and introduce mobility businesses that might keep the factories running like clockwork. The focus will be on electrification, software-defined vehicles and better energy management.
[...] Efforts to go carbon neutral will only be successful if the industry's energy is clean. That means finding eco-friendly fuel to power vehicles and the factories that make them. Japan must pivot to renewable resources such as wind and water. And it must tap new ideas such as ammonia-fired thermal power plants, industrial scale hydrogen electrolysis and carbon dioxide recirculation.
JAMA is still pushing hydrogen, interestingly enough, and wants to promote ""hydrogen stops for fuel cell vehicles and even hydrogen combustion vehicles."" A lot of that is due to the immense strength of Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, and how it continues to play the long game on that technology. Worth a read in full.
It's an ambitious plan and one that needs to start moving immediately. I'd love to see another 1980s-style boom in Japanese automotive technology, but the country isn't running on free money anymore.
I've said before that despite its many challenges and wider skepticism, Ford Motor Company is doing more and better on the EV and software front than it gets credit for. But clearly, it has no business getting complacent.
If EV adoption goes in waves, we may be seeing the ending to one—the rollout of the volume-selling Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, more and better new cars available, the start of record sales and the buildup of a charging infrastructure—before a second one begins. I think that next wave will start in the next year or two, and it will be marked with the race to solid-state or cheaper batteries, cheaper EVs all around and the entry of companies like BYD into the U.S. market.
At a panel last week, the chief operating officer of Ford's EV division didn't allude to Round Two directly, but he alluded to the fierce competition headed our way soon. From The Detroit News:
""That's coming here eventually,"" Marin Gjaja, Ford Model e's COO, said during a panel on disruptive technology held by the automaker. ""So, we better get fit now and better get going on EVs, or we don't have a future.""
[...] “I don't know exactly the timing, but I think they're going to end up here,” Gjaja said, “just as the Japanese ended up here. The Koreans ended up here. The Germans ended up here. It's a big market.”
“The size of the market in China is so big that those players are going to be in a position to go potentially dominate the world, unless we as Ford and other OEMs can respond,” Gjaja said. “Think about all of the capital: the human capital, physical capital, financial capital that’s built into these ecosystems to build vehicles — that is all being massively disrupted, because this technology is progressing so fast.”
Ford is smart to get ready for this. There's still a lot of lingering skepticism about the EV future in America's auto industry in general—and a gulf between what executives say publicly and what they really believe—but they are increasingly freaked out by BYD.
If the Chinese automakers serve as this kind of Baba Yaga figure to scare ours into action, then so be it. Because if America were to slow down the fuel economy rules that were driving greater EV adoption, the auto industry would be extremely foolish to take that as a pass to just make more gas trucks and SUVs forever.
Don't think this EV sales slowdown (which, again, I think is overblown) means a slowdown in EV investments. The Scout Motors factory in South Carolina is a very big deal for parent company Volkswagen Group; we'll have more on that this week at InsideEVs.
In the meantime, the electric Scout SUV and pickup truck need cheaper batteries. The ones built by SK Innovation in Georgia for the VW ID.4 won't work for that new Scout platform; I know this because I asked about it.
Where those batteries will come from remains a mystery. Here's Bloomberg:
Scout Motors Inc., the new US electric vehicle brand backed by Volkswagen AG, is seeking out low-cost battery technology so it can reach mainstream buyers with the sport-utility vehicle it has coming in three years.
With American buyers balking at the high price of electric vehicles, Scout has been scouring battery sources for the most cost-efficient options as it prepares to build 200,000 SUVs and plug-in pickup trucks at a new $2 billion factory it broke ground on Thursday in South Carolina.
“We’re in this startup position and we’re able to pivot,” Scout Chief Executive Officer Scott Keogh said in an interview. “We are looking at battery chemistry and different battery options to decide what to go with and what’s going to give us the best trade off of range and cost.”
The first Scout Motors EVs are expected to roll off the assembly line in late 2026, so as they work on the factory and the cars, they may have time. Two-and-a-half years will be a lifetime in battery development in the U.S., both in terms of sourcing and chemistries.
Toyota has been disappointing to a lot of EV fans, but I wouldn't count out its electric plans—even as I wish it'd do more to make its current lineup a bit more competitive. It also owns or part-owns damn near the entire Japanese auto industry supply chain, so I think it's positioned to do well in the future if it acts now. Subaru and Mazda will probably get led by whatever direction Toyota takes.
As for Nissan, who the heck knows; it still seems to be steeped in chaos these days. Honda is the wild card here.
Do you have faith in Japan's automakers, or are you more skeptical of their long-term prospects?

Biden Administration May Relax EPA Rules Driving Electric Vehicles: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/709077/biden-epa-rollback-nyt/,"Potentially bowing to dealer, automaker and union pressure, the Biden Administration may back off rules leading to wider EV adoption.",2/17/2024 14:52,"In recent years, the American car market has been pushed toward becoming a significantly more electric one by the Biden Administration's strict Environmental Protection Agency rules. Those car tailpipe emission rules are so strict that they could result in two-thirds of all new cars having emissions at all by 2032. But now, after months of pressure from automakers, dealers, labor unions and the other side of the political aisle, the White House may ease up on that plan—a move that will sure to draw the ire of EV proponents and anyone sounding the alarm over global warming.
This report comes from the New York Times, citing three unnamed officials said to be familiar with the plan. The exact details of this plan are not known, except that a ""sharp increase"" in EV sales would not be required ""until after 2030.""
The new EPA rules are expected to be finalized this spring, the Times reports.
America's EV ramp-up hasn't been easy
The race to go all-electric across the globe is pushed by emissions regulations designed to fight climate change. But car dealers, automakers and even owners have often struggled to adapt, even as sales hit new records.
If so, the move could have profound effects on the future of the EV industry, America's ability to compete against a rising electric China, and a signature Biden policy achievement as he faces a tough reelection battle.
From the Times:
The E.P.A. designed the proposed regulations so that 67 percent of sales of new cars and light-duty trucks would be all-electric by 2032, up from 7.6 percent in 2023, a radical remaking of the American automobile market.
That remains the goal. But as they finalize the regulations, administration officials are tweaking the plan to slow the pace at which auto manufacturers would need to comply, so that electric vehicle sales would increase more gradually through 2030 but then would have to sharply rise.
The change in pacing is in response to automakers who say that more time is needed to build a national network of charging stations and to bring down the cost of electric vehicles, and to labor unions that want more time to try to unionize new electric car plants that are opening around the country, particularly in the South.
Last year was a landmark one for EV sales, with all-electric cars making up 7.6% of the market and record sales from every brand. But the rate of EV adoption slowed down toward the end of the year, moving less quickly than the industry anticipated. The so-called ""EV slowdown"" is often overblown, but the transition has been hampered by combatant car dealers, a largely inadequate public charging network, intense political opposition and concerns about how the cars operate differently than gas-powered ones.
The transition to EVs has been especially fraught for automakers, who are spending immense amounts of capital to pivot to battery-powered and software-driven cars—and even for the EV startups that face their own challenges. Moreover, many analysts and industry officials have said EVs haven't yet had the ""breakthrough"" moment that will allow them to become cheaper to buy, while driving further, to meet more Americans' needs.
But if the Biden Administration does in fact back off its 2030 targets, it raises serious questions about the future of an industry undergoing its biggest transformation since the creation of the assembly line. (Former President Donald Trump, Biden's likely opponent in November, has vowed to undo those regulations entirely and told EV supporters they can ""rot in hell"" last Christmas.)
Countless EV plants, battery factories and equipment manufacturing hubs either have been built or are being built to meet this electric future—worth some 200,000 new jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in investments. While those certainly aren't going to evaporate, uncertainty about an EV future isn't great for them.
Furthermore, the Chinese automakers are seen as an existential threat to every other established car company; even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sounded the alarm there. Those automakers, led by BYD, have developed highly advanced and low-cost EVs, and many are getting ready to move into the U.S. market via Mexican factories unless new restrictions somehow keep them out. Giving automakers a pass, essentially, to ""slow down"" on EVs raises serious questions about their ability to compete against China long-term.
Finally, there's the climate question.
The race to electrify America's auto market has been a key component of the Biden Administration's goal of cutting the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050. Nearly all experts say that dialing back zero-emission cars will continue to lead to the most drastic and damaging effects of global warming, something echoed by the Times today:
Postponing the sharp increase in electric vehicle sales until after 2030 would still eliminate roughly the same amount of auto emissions as the original proposal by 2055, according to E.P.A. models. But it would mean the nation would continue to pump auto emissions into the atmosphere in the short run. Scientists say every year counts in the government’s efforts to prevent the planet from tipping into more deadly and costly climate disasters.
“You’ll have faster warming if U.S. transportation emissions don’t decline before 2030,” said James Glynn, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
Scientists have warned that if average global temperatures increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels, humans would struggle to adapt to increasingly violent storms, floods, fires, heat waves and other disruptions.
But if the Biden Administration does agree to dial back its EV goals, they key questions will be: by how much, and to do what instead? How the auto industry responds to all of that will be key to its future—and in part, to the planet's future as well.

The Toyota bZ4X Is Depreciating Massively.

In the luxury world, Lexus vehicles hold onto their values better than products from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and others. But while that holds for internal-combustion cars, the depreciation curve is different for the brands’ early electric efforts. The Toyota bZ4X, Subaru Solterra, and Lexus RZ all lie within that category.
The Toyota and Subaru start in the mid-$40,000 range, around the same price as many competitors such as the Kia EV6, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Tesla Model Y. Despite their solid brand reputations, used examples seem to depreciate rapidly. Secondhand car shoppers can easily find used bZ4X and Solterras in the low $30,000 range. More fascinatingly, many of these examples have a few thousand, if not hundreds of miles on their odometers. Savvy buyers might just find themselves in a lightly used example for thousands off sticker.
There are plenty of heavily depreciated examples floating around on TrueCar. One 2023 bZ4X Limited went for $50,130 when it was new. Now, with 5,000 miles on the odometer, it's listed for $32,673. That's 34.8 percent depreciation despite being put into service eight months ago. Things are no better for its luxurious stablemate. The 2023 Lexus RZ450e Luxury started at $65,150 when new. Today, low demand in the used market means this example with 5,000 miles has been sitting on the lot for 90 days. The sleek EV now features a $43,995 tag along with a comprehensive CPO warranty.  That’s 32.5 percent less than what it was when new.
But why?
There is no question of whether Toyota can make great electrified (i.e. hybrid) vehicles. Toyota pioneered the hybrid powertrain in the late 1990s with the Prius. (Honda was first to the U.S. market, but its Insight never caught on the way the Prius did.) Toyota currently offers 12 hybrids and two plug-in hybrids in the United States market. Lexus offers seven hybrids and three plug-in hybrids—that's 24 different hybrids to choose from. Toyota and Lexus buyers have plenty of choices when buying a hybrid, from sports coupes to minivans. But what about EVs?
Toyota first sold an EV in the U.S. back in 1997. The RAV4 EV was an electric version of the RAV4 sold to appease the California Air Resource Board. After selling and leasing 1,484 RAV4 EVs in the state, Toyota ended the program in 2003. Toyota revived the RAV4 EV as a 2012 model year through a joint venture with Tesla. Like its predecessor, it was short-lived, ending production in 2014. That wasn't the end of Toyota's EV journey, though.
Toyota revealed the bZ4X, its first dedicated EV, in 2021, and deliveries began the subsequent year. Toyota shared the bZ4X's underpinnings (referred to as the e-TNGA platform) with the similarly priced but AWD-only Subaru Solterra and the more upstream Lexus RZ. The bZ4X starts at $44,420 and comes with front-wheel-drive as standard. It features a 71.4- or 72.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with a 201-horsepower single-motor setup or a dual-motor one pushing 215 horses. It offers between 222 and 252 miles of EPA range and up to 150 kilowatts of DC power.
2024 Toyota bZ4X: Starting at $44,420
2024 Subaru Solterra: Starting at $46,340
2024 Lexus RZ300e: Starting at $55,150
These specs aren't worth writing home about. Moreover, last year's Solterra and bZ4X only came with 100kW DC fast charging capabilities. In a real-world charging test done by our friends at Out Of Spec Studios, the 2023 bZ4X AWD fell completely flat. It reached a maximum charge rate of 88 kilowatts and required over four hours to reach a 99 percent state-of-charge. The bZ4X shouldn't be your first choice when looking for an electric road tripper.
Regarding the Lexus RZ450e's 196-mile range, an independent 70-mile-per-hour showed a real-world range of just 172 miles. Other EVs, especially some Tesla models, miss the mark in terms of real-world range. In our 2020 Tesla Model Y range test, we saw 276 miles against an EPA range of 316. A real range of 276 miles is a noticeable decrease, but the Model Y is still highly usable for road trips. A car with 172 miles of range, meanwhile, won’t cut it for some buyers. In other words, the e-TNGA EVs offer subpar range and charging at price points that look bonkers compared to other electric crossovers.
Let's look at the Toyota RAV4 Prime, a plug-in hybrid version of the ubiquitious Toyota RAV4. It debuted as a 2021 model year with a $39,220 price tag (now $45,040). They've proven to hold onto their values exceptionally well. The cheapest sub-50,000-mile example in the country is a 2021 listed for $32,273 with 44,000 miles. It dropped 17.7% of its value in two years of being on the road. The bZ4X we referenced saw a 34.8 percent depreciation in eight months.
The Lexus NX450h+ plug-in hybrid has similarly low depreciation. The least expensive 2023 model is priced at $55,988 with 16,000 miles. Against an original price tag of $62,075, the PHEV Lexus dropped around 9.8 percent in value in 11 months. The RZ450e with 11,000 fewer miles saw 32.5 depreciation in 7 months. While it's difficult to find models that are precisely the same in mileage and age, it's clear that these EVs aren't holding their values well.
""This may certainly seem alarming, given that in general Lexus products typically hold their value very well once in the used market. Consumer confidence in and sentiment of a ‘used EV’ likely isn't as strong as that of a proven ICE or hybrid product,"" wrote Robby DeGraff of the automotive consulting firm AutoPacific. ""While the RZ is no doubt an attractive, upscale product for the brand and serves as Lexus's gateway to an EV future, compared to other similar posh EVs, it really lags behind the competition when it comes to range and value.""
DeGraff's point touched upon two things: buyer sentiment towards EVs and the e-TNGA vehicles' arguably lousy value propositions. Most buyers contemplating purchasing an electric car are likely going to consider the big names—Tesla, Hyundai, and Kia—not Toyota, Lexus, and Subaru.
""Perhaps (consumers are) not as up to speed and aware of the brand's EV efforts, which at this point in time, is still very much in its infancy. Toyota is so synonymous with ‘hybrids’ for many consumers, and that's likely to be the case going forward,"" DeGraff wrote to InsideEVs. ""In our latest 2023 Future Attribute Demand Study in which we poll new vehicle intenders, 41% of future Toyota buyers intend to buy a regular ICE and roughly 32% a hybrid or PHEV. Intention for EVs among future Toyota buyers is only 21%.""
Moreover, in the used car market, there are more hybrids and plug-in hybrids floating around than EVs. More options and more consumer confidence with hybrids are keeping their values higher. ""It's important to keep in mind that consumers are warming up to EVs but not at the rapid-fire pace that automakers had been keeping their fingers crossed for. While EV market share and sales continue to rise year-over-year, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter… the majority of consumers, new and used, are still ICE intenders and purchasers,"" said DeGraff. ""We're not quite at a point yet where there's massive demand for both new and especially used EVs, therefore pricing on used ones isn't going to be as competitive.""
While EVs depreciate more, something must be said about the e-TNGA EVs. Slow charging times, mediocre range, and subpar performance really distance these vehicles from their electric crossover counterparts. ""Especially because this technology is moving so quickly, their value will be in just the fact that they are like… a car,"" said Cars & Bids founder Doug DeMuro. ""I guarantee you that within 48 months, maybe 60 months, Solterras will be 12 grand because they're trash.""
While these crossovers are Toyota and Subaru's foray into the EV space, they miss the mark all around. Consequently, used ones are depreciating rapidly, an outlier among their respective brands' vehicles. Electric cars tend to depreciate more in general, so it's no surprise that uncompetitive models lose value quickly. Before you hop on one as a bargain used car, remember that we still don’t know how low they’ll go. You don’t want to be the one holding the bag at the bottom.

"After Passing Tesla, China's BYD Eyes Mexico Plant For U.S. Sales",https://insideevs.com/news/708540/byd-mexico-tesla-china/,China's EV champion seems dead-set on U.S. sales sooner than later.,2/13/2024 17:00,"It's the worst-kept secret in the automotive world, if you can even call it a secret anymore: leading Chinese plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle manufacturer BYD wants to build a factory in Mexico that would give it a theoretical base of entry into the United States market. BYD is already selling cars in Mexico; why not make them there too, right? And today, a top BYD executive revealed a few more details about this potential expansion plan.
Zhou Zou, the country manager of BYD Mexico, told Nikkei Asia in Mexico City that BYD ""is considering"" setting up a plant in Mexico, explicitly as an export hub to the U.S. Granted, there have been rumblings about this move before, but this is one of the more direct times a BYD official has weighed in on the plan.
China's automakers have global dreams
China's automakers all have global ambitions, and not by selling cars with traditional gasoline engines. Steep tariffs keep cars from companies like BYD out of the U.S. market for now, but little is stopping them from getting around those rules with factories in Mexico.
Nikkei Asia reports that BYD has launched a ""feasibility study"" for a Mexican plant, a facility that would join its growing manufacturing presence in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. After record sales of more than 3 million cars in 2023—including passing Tesla in all-electric vehicle sales for the first time ever—BYD is keen to expand into Latin America, Europe and other parts of Asia.  Zou told the Japanese newspaper that Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula are among the leading candidates for a factory location in that country.
Doing so would help strengthen BYD's presence in Mexico and Latin America, where it is already starting to see strong sales. But a far greater victory for a Mexican plant would be its use as an entry point into the American market, where many automakers are either struggling with or dialing back their electric vehicle plans as demand proves more uncertain than expected.
The biggest thing keeping BYD out of the U.S. for now is steep 27.5% tariffs on Chinese-made cars. But cars made in Mexico are not subject to those same tariffs even if they come from a Chinese-owned company. I wrote ""in theory"" up top because it's certainly possible that U.S. lawmakers could find some way to impose more restrictions on even Mexican-built Chinese cars, but for now, that's not the case.
To put it simply: BYD is a leader in global electric vehicle sales and technology whose car prices seriously undercut most rivals, and a Mexican factory would open the floodgates to those cars competing for buyers with Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Nissan and the rest. And the seriousness of that potential street fight is increasingly weighing on automotive executives in America, many of whom worry they aren't prepared for such a battle. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently expressed fears that Chinese automakers would ""demolish"" rivals without trade barriers in place.
Granted, none of this is an official confirmation from BYD that a Mexican plant is coming; not yet, anyway. But it is further evidence that the plan seems quite likely, even in spite of high interest rates, an uncertain economy and questions over EV demand in the U.S.
Moreover, as Nikkei Asia reports, it is more proof of how Mexico is quickly becoming a major EV manufacturing hub in the Western Hemisphere. Kia, BMW, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford are either building EVs there now or quickly ramping them up to take advantage of lower labor costs as all of them chase more affordable electric cars.
The question now is: will they be able to fend off BYD when, and likely not if, the company comes to the U.S.?

Tesla Made $1.79 Billion In 2023 Just From Selling EV Credits To Other Carmakers,https://insideevs.com/news/708342/tesla-reguatory-credits-1-79-billion-2023/,Saving the world’s automakers from fines made Tesla nearly $9 billion since 2009.,2/12/2024 12:01,"Besides making a pretty penny from selling all-electric cars, Tesla is raking in a nice profit just from selling regulatory credits to other car companies around the world.
Last year, the Elon Musk-led EV maker cashed in on $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue, according to Automotive News, with the cumulative total from this source of income reaching almost $9 billion since 2009.
Making money from EV credits
Tesla made almost $9 billion in revenue since 2009 just from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. Last year, the American company made $1.79 billion from selling papers to car manufacturers that can't stay below certain emissions limits for new-car fleets.
Regulatory credits are bought by automakers from across the world that have new-vehicle fleet emissions above those set by the local authorities in places like China, the European Union, and the state of California.

In other words, the average emissions of a carmaker’s portfolio have to slip under a certain limit in order to avoid a hefty fine. But how do you stay under the limit if you only make gas- and diesel-burning cars? Well, you buy some credits from companies that only make zero-emissions cars and legally get away with it.
We don’t know how much money Tesla made from each individual automaker buying credits, but it’s good business for the American EV manufacturer. However, in the grand scheme of things, selling a lifeline to carmakers that don’t build more EVs isn’t as big of a deal as one would expect. In 2023, Tesla reported total revenue from the automotive business of $82.4 billion, meaning regulatory credits amount to just 1.4%.
That said, it’s almost like free money for Tesla, as there’s little to no associated cost to selling the credits, making the sales virtually pure profit, Automotive News writes.
A Tesla Model X charging at a Supercharger
Last year, Tesla and its U.S.-based battery-making partner Panasonic also received between $900 and $1,400 in government subsidies for every EV sold here thanks to the battery tax credits put in place by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Back in 2020, Tesla’s then-CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said during the July earnings call that the American company isn’t managed based on the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future. “It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce,” he added.
But while optimism was rampant in 2020 when it came to the rate at which the EV market would grow, recent developments might help Tesla continue to make good money off of regulatory credits as several automakers have significantly slowed down their EV output and toned down their enthusiasm on the EV market’s growth rate. This means that fewer EVs will hit the road in the coming months, and Tesla will keep selling regulatory credits to manufacturers that bet on combustion to keep the lights on.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tire Wear Is Especially Bad For Electric Vehicles, J.D. Power Says",https://insideevs.com/news/708011/ev-reliability-jd-power-2024/,Rankings for electric vehicles plummeted in J.D. Power's recent dependability study.,2/12/2024 9:00,"Long-term vehicle dependability has declined across the automotive industry, consumer insights and data analytics firm J.D. Power said in its recently released 2024 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study. Particularly striking is electric cars ranking far below their gas-powered counterparts. Higher tire wear is a ""sore spot"" for EVs, and smartphone apps are troublesome, leading to a lower dependability score, J.D. Power said.
The study found that the owners of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids experienced far more problems than gas cars. On average, ICE cars experienced 187 problems per 100 vehicles, PHEVs witnessed 216 problems, while BEVs fared far worse with a score of 256 problems per 100 vehicles over three years of ownership. Lexus and Toyota were the least troublesome—which is hardly a surprise—while Tesla fared rather poorly.
To measure the dependability of a brand, J.D. Power analyzed nine major problems reported by owners, including driver assistance features, driving experience, exterior, infotainment, interior, powertrain, and seats among others.
It's worth noting that this data has some limitations. We only have information regarding tires and infotainment systems for this story. J.D. Power hasn't said much about the reliability of batteries, drivetrain, and range and performance in its report. So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison with gas cars. There are several variables outlined later in the story that should be considered before drawing any conclusions about EVs.
In a nutshell, it's best to approach this data with caution.
Thirty-nine percent of BEV owners said they had to replace their tires at least once in the past 12 months, compared to just 20% of gas car owners admitting the same.
“That's something to be concerned about. [EV buyers] are going to save money at the gas pump, but the trade-off is that they would have to replace tires more often. So, it's a cost of ownership issue you need to think about,” Frank Hanley, the senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power, told InsideEVs.
Several reasons can lead to higher tire degradation in EVs. For starters, EVs require less maintenance due to fewer components and less complex drivetrains. That impacts tires. By not taking your EV to service, you might not rotate the tires as frequently as you would in a gas car. That could especially be true if you’re unaware of the required tire maintenance intervals.
Routinely rotating your tires evens the spread of wear, and it maximizes tread life, Bridgestone and several other tire manufacturers have said.
EVs are also generally heavier than gas cars due to hefty batteries that demand higher tire weight ratings. The instant torque from the electric motors, a trademark feature of EVs that many enthusiasts love, also leads to more tire wear—e-motors deliver torque more precisely and quickly to individual wheels with micro-adjustments to optimize traction at all times.
There's no reason for the tire issue to ring any alarm bells because tire technology seems on track to develop over time. And you could minimize the wear by following simple textbook rules.
Flooring the throttle to devour the instant torque at every green light will likely cost you in the long run. But if you monitor tire pressure regularly, rotate tires according to the OEM's recommended schedule, and drive efficiently overall, you could prolong the life of the tires.
The study also found that faulty smartphone apps lowered the dependability rankings for EVs. Hanley added that EV owners are a lot more smartphone-dependent than gas-car owners. “Smartphones for gas cars are like a nice-to-have, versus for EVs, they’re sort of a lifeline,” Hanley said.
EV owners tend to use smartphones to check battery status, adjust climate settings, and locate charging stations, among other functions. In theory, the apps are meant to give owners more control over their EV remotely and make tasks more convenient. But in the real world, they don't seem to be flawlessly integrated, at least not yet.
Without mentioning any carmaker or model, Hanley added that EV owners reported issues where apps didn’t connect to the car, weren’t updated with the correct information and even displayed wrong data. Across the industry, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and voice assistants caused the most trouble for vehicle owners.
CarPlay and Android Auto often suffer from bad connections, poor rendering, and slow responses, a General Motors spokesperson told MotorTrend in December 2023. These issues prompt owners to use their smartphones instead, thereby defeating the purpose of mirroring these apps and elevating safety risks.
That’s one of the reasons GM dropped CarPlay and Android Auto from its future cars, MotorTrend said. Instead, GM’s new “Ultifi” infotainment system will get a full suite of inbuilt Google apps.
Other factors causing a lower dependability score include outdated maps, improper installation of over-the-air updates, and poor wireless charging pads, J.D. Power told InsideEVs. Hanley agreed that software-defined vehicles are likely to continue having connectivity issues until the technology matures and is seamlessly integrated.
This study hardly spells doom for EVs. EVs constituted only 2.5% of the sample size (approximately 750 cars). Furthermore, the majority of these EVs were MY2021 Teslas, making the data somewhat outdated.
A recent Consumer Reports reliability survey also concluded that EVs were worse off on the reliability index. But it added that EVs in their first model year faced more issues with motors, charging systems, and batteries. Tesla slotted in the middle of the pack, much higher than it did in the J.D. Power survey.
EVs generally tend to improve over time, and Tesla especially has a track record of bettering its cars over the years. The Model 3 is in its seventh year (the first year for the Highland facelift), while the Model Y is in its fourth year.
Yes, frequent tire replacements might indeed increase the cost of ownership. But even then, net savings will likely be positive. A CNBC estimate suggested that a Model Y owner could save over $11,000 over five years in maintenance and gas savings compared to an Audi Q5 owner.
A set of Goodyear Electric GT tires for the Model Y costs about $1200. Even if you replace them twice the number of times as a gas car, your net savings can still be higher. That's the worst-case scenario—one that you probably won't encounter if you take good care of the tires in the first place.

All said, the study highlights the steep learning curve for EV owners, and how important education would be for wider adoption of EVs. Not only should you be aware of the best practices for charging and how to maximize range, but also of the less obvious stuff, such as conserving tire health over time.",Suvrat Kothari
Toyota Steps Up Investment For Three-Row Electric SUV Built In Kentucky,https://insideevs.com/news/707647/toyota-boosts-investment-kentucky-plant-for-bevs/,The plant gets another $1.3 billion and a new battery assembly line.,2/6/2024 16:00,"Toyota announced an additional $1.3 billion of investment at its Georgetown, Kentucky plant today. The brand said in a statement that the investment will be earmarked for assembling its upcoming three-row electric SUV for the U.S. market.
The new investment will also support the construction of a new battery assembly line. This complements Toyota's plans to assemble batteries at its North Carolina facility. With this latest investment, Toyota's commitment to electrification in the U.S. amounts to nearly $10 billion.
Toyota steps up its U.S. electrification efforts
Toyota has long been accused of being an intentional latecomer to the EV game, with company leadership favoring hydrogen and hybrid cars. It's had a ton of success lately with the latter, but may now be coming around on full EVs.
Much of that investment has gone into developing the upcoming Kia EV9 challenger, which Toyota says will enter production by 2025.
At Toyota's Beyond Zero summit in 2021, the automaker announced its plan to launch 30 BEVs globally by 2030. One of those concepts was labeled “bZ Large SUV.” The new model for North America is likely related to that and is rumored to be named the bZ5x.
Toyota's largest global manufacturing site in Georgetown, Kentucky
After decades of building combustion and hybrid cars, Toyota is a late bloomer in the EV race. There’s only one Toyota-branded pure electric car sold in the U.S., the bZ4x. The Subaru Solterra and the Lexus RZ 450e are the same underneath but wear different clothes.
The new investment comes as part of Toyota's multi-pronged approach to electrification. That approach includes promoting self-charging hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Toyota will also continue to invest in combustion engines.
Jack Hollis, Toyota Motor North America’s head of sales, doubled down on this approach recently. “Our dealers are not telling us that the customer wants EVs more than other things. They’re telling us they want EVs as a choice,” he said at a NADA conference last week.

Toyota: We Make Hybrids Because Customers Want Them,https://insideevs.com/news/707483/toyota-hybrids-customers-want-them/,"The automaker has been criticized for being a laggard in the EV-only game, but it might have the last laugh.",2/6/2024 11:00,"Toyota, the Japanese company that currently sells just one all-electric vehicle in the United States–the bZ4X crossover–is known in hardline electric car enthusiast groups as being a laggard in transitioning to a fully electric portfolio.
The Japanese automaker even went on record through the voice of its main science man Gill Pratt last year, who said that EV-only extremists are wrong and that in the long run, a diversified powertrain approach will win–both for the environment and for the customers.
Toyota's bet on hybrids and plug-in hybrids might pay off
Toyota has long touted that its diversified powertrain approach is the best solution both for the environment and its customers. And while the EV market experiences a slowdown in growth, Toyota's strategy might pay off, at least when it comes to sales.
His reasoning was that most people usually don’t need the massive batteries that are fitted to long-range EVs. As such, resources are wasted on batteries that aren’t used at their full potential. The solution, in Toyota’s eyes? Spread the same materials that would go into a big battery across multiple, smaller batteries that are part of hybrid or plug-in hybrid setups.
Toyota has since changed its stance on EVs and is planning a full lineup of next-gen vehicles that could offer upwards of 621 miles of range on a full charge by the end of this decade. But even with a renewed appetite for all-electric cars, Toyota isn’t giving up on its diversified powertrain approach, which might actually give it the upper hand in terms of sales as the growth in the EV-only segment slows, at least in the short term.
The reason for this multipronged strategy, as the Nippon manufacturer calls it, boils down to the customer. In short, people don’t want EVs any more than they want plug-in hybrids, hydrogen-powered cars, and even gasoline-only vehicles.
More Toyota Stories
That’s what Toyota North America’s head of sales, Jack Hollis, said during the Automotive News Retail Forum: NADA last week. “Our strategy is based on what dealers are telling us the customer wants,” Hollis said. “Our dealers are not telling us that the customer wants EVs more than other things. They’re telling us they want EVs as a choice. They want plug-in hybrids as a choice. They want hydrogen as a choice. In fact, they would like to have gas engines [as a choice] but also have cleaner-burning fuels,” Toyota’s executive vice president of sales added.
Furthermore, through the voice of Jack Hollis, Toyota is concerned that regulation which will require a major shift toward all-electric vehicles by the end of the decade might not work out as lawmakers intended because if customers won’t be more willing to choose a battery-powered car instead of a combustion one.
“Regulations are way out in front of where the customer is at,” Hollis said. “That never works well for any industry. The customers have to lead, the regulations have to be able to protect them. Not the other way around.”
But aren’t these regulations meant exactly for the customers, in the sense that they’ll be able to breathe cleaner air when they step outside? And shouldn’t manufacturers and dealers step up their game when it comes to educating their customers about the benefits of getting an all-electric car as opposed to opting for the default, gas-powered solution?
These are all valid questions but for the consumer who doesn’t have $40,000 to spend on a new EV, they get relegated to the bottom of the priorities list. And not everybody wants a Tesla, for various reasons, even if the Model 3 and Model Y are among the most affordable EVs in the United States now.
So it makes sense that shoppers who want a new car but can’t afford an EV would go for a cheaper hybrid or plug-in hybrid. The Tesla Model 3 starts at $38,990 without the destination charge. The Toyota Corolla hybrid? $23,500. The bigger Prius goes from $27,950.
And it’s this price gap that might help Toyota keep its crown as the best-selling car manufacturer in the world as the EV market experiences a slowdown in growth. The same Jack Hollis said that the percentage of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold by Toyota and Lexus in the U.S. would continue to rise above the record-high 29% it recorded last year.",Iulian Dnistran
Dealers Say 'Slow Down' On EVs. But The Sales Numbers Say Otherwise,https://insideevs.com/news/706308/ev-dealer-biden-slowdown-2023/,Last year was an exceptionally good one for EV sales. So why are so many car dealers still not onboard?,2/2/2024 14:02,"Last year emerged as a record-breaking one for electric vehicle sales in the U.S., defying the prevalent narrative of dwindling EV demand. Automakers sold over one million pure-electric models in 2023, a nearly 50% increase compared to the year before. Sure, Tesla grabbed the lion's share of this pie, but it's worth noting that every car company that sells EVs in the U.S. also had a standout year of EV and PHEV sales.
However, the EV sales records coincide with something else—U.S. car dealers have orchestrated a staunch rebellion against EVs. After writing a letter to President Biden in November 2023, urging him to “tap the brakes” on the Environmental Protection Agency’s new emissions proposal, dealers last week wrote a second letter to Biden.
This time, the request was not to tap the brakes but to slam them.
Car dealers request President Biden to pause EPA mandate again
The Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. government's agency that establishes national pollution control standards, wants to increase the share of EV sales substantially by 2032. But car dealers have opposed this plan, citing low consumer demand among several other roadblocks.
The dealers—after getting no apparent response from the Biden Administration to their first letter—say in their second letter that “[i]t is uncontestable that the combination of fewer tax incentives, a woefully inadequate charging infrastructure, and insufficient consumer demand makes the proposed EV mandate completely unrealistic.”
The EPA is expected to finalize an ambitious and aggressive plan this year to slash emissions. Outlined over 262 pages, it has stated how the new regulations will remove millions of metric tons of particulate matter, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, diesel exhaust, and air toxics by imposing restrictions on the sales of gasoline- and diesel-powered light- and heavy-duty vehicles.
The EPA is proposing to achieve this by increasing the share of light-duty EV sales to 67%, and commercial EV sales to 25% by 2032. Thousands of dealers across the country detest this plan. Some of their concerns are undoubtedly valid, like the fact that only 19 models qualify for the federal tax credits this year, compared to 43 last year, leaving customers with far fewer options.
This is because the U.S. Department of Treasury has revised its guidance surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act, encouraging automakers to establish a localized EV supply chain. This is aimed at further reducing reliance on China for critical components like batteries, leaving dozens of models ineligible with their current components and supply chains.
However, that's changing quickly. Several models are expected to regain their eligibility for tax credits in the coming months—the Volkswagen ID.4 recently qualified, and General Motors is optimistic that the Lyriq and Blazer EV will qualify as well. While the concerns around fewer tax incentives and inadequate charging infrastructure are true, the claim about insufficient consumer demand looks shaky.
In 2023, U.S. automakers rolled out EVs off their assembly lines at a record pace. The total sales of rechargeable models—including BEVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles—amounted to 1.4 million. Of this pie, 1.1 million were fully electric models. Mercedes-Benz saw its U.S. EV sales rise by a record 139%. Volkswagen Group’s EV sales surged by 61%. Ford delivered over 72,000 EVs, a new record. Most other OEMs, including Volvo, Nissan, and the Hyundai Motor Group, saw their BEV sales soar.

So why are the dealers pushing back against EVs? Inadequate charging infrastructure is one persistent issue. There’s also the fact that 43% of dealer profits emerge from parts, labor, and service, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2019—EVs have fewer components and require far less maintenance.
That’s not the only reason they can represent a threat to dealer balance sheets. A skewed supply-demand ratio has increased the time EVs spend on dealer lots. By the end of November 2023, EV inventory levels reached a new high with 114 days of supply, Cox Automotive’s data showed. This is more than double the 53-day supply from the same period in November 2022. (Data excludes Tesla and Rivian due to their direct-to-consumer sales model.)
This is one of the reasons that prompted Ford to cut its production targets for the F-150 Lightning, while GM delayed its ambition of producing 400,000 EVs in North America in 2024—delaying the production of several models in the process.
But the dealers also bear some responsibility. There’s ample evidence that sales reps at car dealerships have blatantly lied about EVs, and coerced buyers to purchase gas cars. Some experts agree. They aren’t convinced that dealers are investing enough in educating their staff (and the customers) regarding EVs.
When I asked Loren McDonald, the CEO of EV consulting and marketing analysis agency EVAdoption, if dealers were simply bad at selling EVs, he said, “Yes and no. We’ve all heard the stories of clueless dealer sales reps when it comes to EVs.”
McDonald ran into a poorly informed sales rep at a Mercedes-Benz dealership a year ago. “He didn’t know if the EQB we were test driving had regenerative braking. He had to get a service technician to come out and try to figure it out—and he didn’t know how to turn it on. I finally figured it out myself,” McDonald told InsideEVs.
EVs, in a way, are a whole new language that needs learning, but dealers don’t seem to understand that. “Fundamentally, dealers and legacy automakers have yet to understand that they are selling a different product, one that is fueled by electricity and not gas,” McDonald said. “People are completely unfamiliar with the charging process, terminology, best practices, where to charge, how to charge, etc,” he added.
Over at the Sierra Club, a Washington D.C.-based environmental organization, a spokesperson used much harsher words to describe the dealers’ attempts to thwart the EPA’s efforts.
“Auto dealers are once again trying to block major progress on cleaner cars. For years, the Sierra Club has called out dealers (and automakers themselves) for failing to keep up with consumer demand for EVs,” Katherine Garcia, Sierra Club’s director of Clean Transportation For All told InsideEVs.
“The dealers have had years to prepare for the EV transition, but they’ve dragged their feet along the way,” Garcia added.
She thought this was unfair to Americans, especially those impacted by air pollution. “The dealers’ lobbying to weaken the EPA’s vehicle standards is an affront to American families. These important safeguards will protect families from car pollution, save drivers at the pump, and clean up climate emissions,” Garcia said. The negative impact of gas emissions on the environment has been broadly documented and proven.
McDonald suggested automakers might be behind dealers' woes due to some “strategic blunders,” like “bringing out BEV pickups for a segment that doesn’t see BEV pickups as meeting their needs of towing and range, versus large and mid-sized SUVs,” he said.
While electric pickups might not offer as much range, they still have a lot of demand—GM CEO Mary Barra recently said GM has 100,000 orders for its electric pickups, which includes the Silverado EV, Hummer EV, and Sierra EV. (The Tesla Cybertruck has over 1 million reservations, although selling them is not a dealer problem as Tesla sells directly to its customers.)
“The Chevy Bolt was the third-highest-selling EV in the U.S. in 2023. So clearly people are interested in EVs if the product is good, and fits their budget and driving needs and situation,” McDonald added. He also noted that more options were needed in the large and mid-size SUV segments, where volumes are generally high in the U.S.
“The Kia EV9 will likely do very well in 2024 and 2025. But where is the electric Ford Explorer? Where is the electric Chevy Tahoe?” he said.
Despite some of these “strategic blunders,” many automakers are all in on EVs—or at least they say. Regardless of how well they navigate the bumpy road ahead, they need dealers’ support to clear inventories, boost production, and keep the cycle going.
Whether dealers like it or not, the EV revolution is happening. Instead of writing letters that may go unread in the presidential inbox, dealers might find greater dividends in focusing on education—for both their staff and consumers. Investing in knowledge sooner rather than later could be a win-win for everyone involved.

"Some Automakers Soften On EVs, But Lucid Charges Forward",https://insideevs.com/news/707054/lucid-charges-forward-on-evs/,"CEO Peter Rawlinson thinks the future is bright for Lucid, citing behind-the-scenes groundwork that should pay off soon.",2/1/2024 14:40,"It’s almost as if 2024’s setting up to be a come-to-Jesus moment for EVs, as manufacturers ask what level of growth is truly sustainable for an electrified future. Overspending on development for returns that aren’t happening as fast as expected is leaving manufacturers with a dilemma: Do we press forward, or slow-roll existing plans? GM, Ford, and more are all scaling back their EV plans in the face of softer-than-expected (but growing) demand. Just recently, Elon Musk was candid with shareholders that he does not expect Tesla to be able to sustain the same level of growth it saw in 2023.
One company is adamant that it has the chutzpah to go the distance: Lucid. Last week, during a candid conversation with Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson at its Arizona factory, Rawlinson was very optimistic about Lucid’s position in the face of the rest of the industry. As other manufacturers soften and scale back, it’s full steam ahead at Lucid Motors, even after a year where the brand underdelivered.
Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson sees a bright future
Lucid Motors missed its manufacturing and sales targets for 2023, and its stock price faced similar headwinds. However, Lucid's CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson insists that a plant expansion, forthcoming new products, smarter communications strategy, and other behind-the-scenes investments are things that have set Lucid up for a stronger future.
“I think it’s a weird time, I think that macroeconomics and high-interest rates are really, really affecting luxury car sales,” said Rawlinson, admitting that Lucid’s missed targets disappoint everyone, including himself. But Rawlinson asks us to reframe Lucid’s numbers. In the US, the Lucid Air outsold cars like the BMW i7 (which was, admittedly, in its first year on sale) and is about one to two thousand units behind cars like the Mercedes-Benz EQS and Porsche Taycan. Although its 6,001 sales for 2023 were below its expectations, year-over-year, the Air has increased by 37%. Rawlinson notes that in the same time period, Tesla Model S sales declined. Likewise, he admitted that a simplified lineup and more competitive price structure for the 2024 model year may help the Air’s sales.
Rawlinson claims that its factory expansion and other long-term investments will pay off in 2024.
“There’s undue doom and gloom about electric cars; electric vehicles are the future. There are a lot of subpar EVs out there, and I believe that this is a tech race, and we’re in for the long haul,” said Rawlinson. Rawlinson says that there’s a lot of future-proofing and investment associated with sustainable mobility and electric cars that go beyond just Lucid’s financial statements. The Gravity and Midsize launches are also big opportunties for the brand, with Rawlinson suggesting they'll put the brand ahead of the pack.
Other OEMs are rethinking the EV revolution, perhaps waffling back toward ICE and hybrid options. Lucid, though, is built to make EVs, and it can now make a lot of them. The company's expanded factory can produce the Air and Gravity on the same line, which should help satisfy demand in new markets like China and Western Europe.
“Chinese market cars have to have their VINs stamped on the passenger floor, if the stamping isn’t explicitly clear, the cars will be rejected at import,” plant director Steven Inglis said as we toured the Arizona facility, highlighting just one of the challenges the plant faced as it geared up for foreign-market production.
Perhaps these are charitable reads on Lucid’s somewhat lackluster 2023, from leaders who view the company’s success as an imperative. From their hopeful comments, the sky is the limit for Lucid. However, some analysts remain more conservative in the face of market realities. “The Air and Gravity are very neat EVs, but they are priced out of reach for most new car shoppers, “ Ed Kim, president of auto market analysis firm AutoPacific, told InsideEVs via email.
Like Rawlinson, Kim doesn’t see the relative softening of still-growing EV demand as a death knell for electric cars entirely, as some anti-EV pundits suggest. Rather, it’s a symptom of badly planned product lineups, via an overemphasis on high-end luxury products, a problem that Lucid is a part of.
“The softening in the rate of adoption is a reflection of other factors, such as too many EV nameplates clustered at luxury price points (even for non-lux EV nameplates) and a resulting lack of affordable EV models that are needed to keep the rate of adoption going,” wrote Kim. “AutoPacific’s own data from the Future Attribute Demand Study (FADS) show that price is one of the top reasons that EV rejectors cite as a reason for not going electric. When those same people are asked what price point they’ll consider an EV, the data show that demand rises sharply below $35,000. As affordable and appealing new affordable EVs enter the market in the coming years, we expect the rate of EV adoption to soar,” he continued.
The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV’s roughly $30,000 price resonated so hard with consumers that they continued to set sales records despite GM announcing its death, prompting executives within the company to make a way for the car to return. The Tesla Model Y is the best-selling car in the world for a reason. It’s very close to the $35,000 price ceiling with the federal tax credit and can slip under it with state-level incentives. Granted, Lucid’s midsize car with a targeted starting price of $50,000 is above that $35,000 sweet spot, but it’s certainly a hell of a lot more affordable than the easily six-figure range of the Air sedan and forthcoming Gravity crossover. “If Lucid’s future midsize products incorporate most of what makes the Air and Gravity so desirable, Lucid has a great opportunity to grow and expand to the mainstream with strong appeal,” wrote Kim.
Lucid’s mainstream aspirations could seem strange considering its hyper-lux roots. This move downmarket could interpreted by some as a sales-starved brand pivoting to boost its flagging numbers, at the expense of brand image. The announcement certainly raised eyebrows.
Rawlinson sees it differently. In a relative sense, he says that Lucid has always had affordable products. True, the Air sedan’s not cheap, but when compared to its direct big sedan EV rivals, the Air solidly undercuts the EQE and EQS. “I think we need to do a better job in comms,” said Rawlinson. If it wants to succeed in selling cheaper models, Lucid has to make sure consumers know that it isn't sticking to the ultra-luxury space.
Will that be enough to get Lucid from slow trot to full sprint? The path seems treacherous, but the Lucid team’s ready to put up a fight.",Kevin Williams
Volvo Stops Funding Polestar As Geely Prepares Bailout,https://insideevs.com/news/707036/volvo-stops-funding-polestar-geely-new-significant-shareholder/,"The two companies will continue to collaborate on R&D, manufacturing, and sales.",2/1/2024 13:11,"Volvo Cars will discontinue funding all-electric performance brand Polestar, the Swedish carmaker said today in its 2023 financial statement. Describing this move as a “decisive transformation phase,” Volvo plans to reallocate funds from Polestar towards its own projects. The decision comes in the wake of a 43% increase in Volvo's profits in 2023, a record in its 97-year history, the company claims.
Both Volvo and Polestar are subsidiaries of China's Zhejiang Geely Holding group. Under the new agreement, Volvo intends to transfer a portion of its 48% stake in Polestar to parent company Geely, which will become a ""significant"" new shareholder in Polestar. Geely has promised to provide “full operational and financial support to Polestar” going forward.
The difference between Polestar and Volvo is rather confusing
Polestar was originally launched as a more performance-oriented, BEV-only, and exclusive sibling to Volvo. But with Volvo's own EV plans taking off successfully, and Polestar struggling, the line between the two brands has blurred.
It’s worth noting that Geely’s 79% stake in Volvo Cars remains unaffected by this development.
2023 was a record year for EV sales for most brands in the U.S., including Volvo. The automaker sold 113,419 BEVs in 2023 globally, a 70% increase compared to 2022. That figure includes the 35,000 plug-in cars (including PHEVs) it sold in the U.S., of which 13,609 were fully electric models. EVs represented 16% of its total global sales volume.
However, the story at Polestar has been somewhat different. It announced early this week that it was laying off 15% of its global workforce to reduce costs. It also struggled to meet its delivery targets in 2023. Despite the setbacks, it said that the rollouts of the Polestar 3 electric performance SUV and the Polestar 4 coupe were imminent.
More Volvo News
“Volvo Cars’ and Polestar’s strong operational collaboration across R&D, manufacturing, after-sales, and commercial will continue to benefit both companies,” Jim Rowan, the president and CEO of Volvo Cars AB said. Volvo is bullish on its 2024 outlook as well, stating that it expects a higher year-over-year growth rate in its retail sales in 2024 compared to 2023.
Volvo's 2023 EV sales are based only on two models, the C40 Recharge and the XC40 Recharge. However, this year, Volvo is on track to expand its EV portfolio with the EX30, the smallest and the fastest Volvo ever, its bigger sibling the EX90, which is a full-sized electric SUV, and the EM90 MPV which Volvo cheekily describes as the ""Scandinavian living room on wheels.""",Suvrat Kothari
Here’s Why The Toyota bZ4x Is An Unexpected Hit In New York City,https://insideevs.com/news/706553/toyota-bz4x-new-york-rideshare/,A few factors have made Toyota's EV quite popular in the Big Apple.,1/30/2024 10:00,"If your mental image of New York City's streets is still dominated by the classic yellow Ford Crown Victoria taxis, it's time for an update. These days, the for-hire car of choice, whether they're the iconic yellow cabs or the commonly all-black vehicles for Uber and Lyft drivers, tends to be the hybrid Toyota RAV4s and Camrys. But could the all-electric Toyota bZ4x be the next contender for the NYC cab throne?
That may just be the case. Toyota's first modern battery EV is coming off its best sales year ever in 2023, doubling from the previous year in the third quarter alone. In addition to an improved sales performance, a few more factors coalesced to make it somewhat popular in New York City. Those include the recent rideshare regulations aimed at boosting EV adoption across the five boroughs and the fact that the bZ4x adorns a Toyota badge, one that has been associated with bulletproof reliability for decades.
The Toyota bZ4x gets a win in the for-hire car business
The Toyota bZ4x has been described as underwhelming on paper in terms of range and charging performance. But Toyota's reputation for quality and reliability is impossible to beat.
Over the past few weeks, InsideEVs has noticed a high number of bZ4xs rolling silently on NYC’s streets, and many of them wear the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) plates—meaning they’re ride-hail vehicles. I even spotted one patiently waiting amidst a sea of Teslas at a Brooklyn Supercharger that supports the CCS plug, but its owner wasn't interested in chatting.
In October 2023, the TLC passed its Green Rides Initiative, mandating all new for-hire vehicles to be electric. This led to a sudden surge in license applications, with TLC's daily intake skyrocketing from 150 to 2,000 applications overnight, a TLC spokesperson told InsideEVs. In a month, the agency received close to 10,000 applications—an unforeseen and overwhelming response.
A lot of those drivers went for Teslas. But several of them also seem to be choosing a brand they know and trust: Toyota.
By mid-November, the TLC had approved approximately 5,700 applications, with 88 percent belonging to individual drivers, according to a TLC spokesperson.
Coincidentally, Toyota ended 2023 on a high for its plug-in electric car sales. BZ4x sales soared by 188% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, and Toyota delivered 9,329 units during the whole year, up 663%. Toyota Motor North America confirmed to InsideEVs that within the U.S., New York State's share of bZ4x sales had increased from 8.8% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023—meaning a shade over 1,400 bZ4xs were sold in New York State last year.
“We have seen an uptick especially in the New York area, specifically in New York City, after the new regulation that encourages rideshare [drivers] to move towards EVs. It’s a good sign for us as a company,"" Joe Moses, the vice president of marketing at Toyota Motor North America told InsideEVs. ""We're starting to produce a few more and you could see when people do get a chance to experience it, they're picking it.""
It's safe to say that the Toyota bZ4x isn't the first thing that springs to mind when we think of truly great electric cars. It has some clear shortcomings: its fast-charging speed lags far behind Tesla and other rivals, it's built on a repurposed gasoline-car platform, and its electric range is a modest 252 miles in an age when 300 miles is a kind of mandatory minimum for family-focused crossovers.
Still, Toyota as a brand is the go-to for drivers looking for bulletproof daily use, and that increasingly includes the bZ4x for cab and Uber duty. Other New Yorkers have also noticed the trend. On one Reddit thread about the bZ4x, a user said, “All I hear online about this car is how bad it is, but I see them everywhere in NYC.” Another one said, “Its creature comforts are good value for the money, and if it fits your needs it is a reasonable choice.” Others agreed that it’s an adequate EV for the city from a brand that people have trusted for decades.
One user claimed to have driven to Alabama to buy one from a Tuscaloosa dealership that offered heavy discounts. “I now have a 10-year 95% [state of charge] guarantee with my bZ4x bought at 600 miles for $35,000,"" this person wrote. ""The insurance is cheap. And it is manufactured in Japan. The build quality is excellent, the car's performance is nothing new but it averages 200-240 miles.""
Toyota has added a bunch of additional features to the updated 2024 bZ4x, and they also include a year of complimentary charging at EVgo stations. The car's popularity is obvious when you get past some of the specs: in terms of shape, design, packaging, and experience, it is essentially an all-electric RAV4—one of the best-selling SUVs in North America.
In terms of comfort, build quality and features, InsideEVs found no real complaints with the bZ4x when we reviewed it two years ago. According to our sister publication Motor1.com, “the bZ has enough going for it to attract Toyota brand loyalists.”
Some estimates suggest that rideshare drivers cover between 100-300 miles per day, and it’s obvious that many of them drive gas-powered (and hybrid) Toyotas. If the bZ4x’s range was a little over 300 miles, it could potentially draw in Toyota loyalists seeking an upgrade from the RAV4.
“Bringing the right product that meets the needs of the mass consumers is how you get to RAV4 levels of volume. But being realistic, there are still a lot of questions under work around EVs, a lot of pieces in this puzzle that everybody's working aggressively on,” Toyota's Moses said. “Before we get to a point where we have something [electric that sells as much as] the RAV4, which is selling over 400,000 units a year, a lot of things need to be in place to be able to do that.""
That certainly includes more fast-charging support in cities like New York, which is becoming a problem as more and more taxi and ride-hail drivers go fully electric. Much of the emphasis on fast-charger growth has been along highways to support the great American road trip, but in New York—where it's monumentally tough to build anything—more infrastructure is needed in the five boroughs to support drivers whose cars are on the road all the time.
There's also the ongoing conflict between New York's established yellow cab system and the upstarts like Uber and Lyft. It’s hard to predict the bZ4x’s sales this year as the TLC is embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance which represents yellow cab, livery, and app-based drivers. The NYTWA has filed a lawsuit against the TLC, alleging that lifting the cap on for-hire EVs would harm the drivers who have not regained pre-pandemic levels of business. A Manhattan Supreme Court judge has temporarily blocked the TLC from issuing more for-hire licenses—which could impact all EV sales.
All said, Toyota is already working on batteries that would offer twice the range of a bZ4x. It has invested heavily in solid-state battery technology, and has a bunch of models in the pipeline that will ride on ground-up EV platforms; we saw some cool concepts at the Japan Mobility Show last year. The automaker is also unlikely to cede its hybrid crown to anyone soon, and it's likely the electrified RAV4 and Camry will continue to be the weapon of choice for most drivers for a while—in fact, the next Camry is going all-hybrid, which is good news for emissions in the city.
But if the bZ4x's unexpected success in NYC is any indication of consumers' willingness to embrace all-electric Toyotas under favorable policies, one can only imagine the reception an affordable, long-range, and reliable Toyota EV built on a dedicated platform would garner under the ideal circumstances.
Moses agreed that reliability would play a role in Toyota's future EVs. “It's something we're proud of as a company, having that type of reputation. I think many companies would kill to have that,” he said.

Polestar To Cut 15% Of Its Staff Globally Amid ‘Challenging Market Conditions’,https://insideevs.com/news/706411/polestar-staff-cuts-challenging-market-conditions/,The Swedish-based all-electric carmaker saw sales decline 39% in the fourth quarter of last year.,1/29/2024 10:00,"Polestar, Volvo’s sister company in Geely’s growing portfolio of automotive marques, will lay off about 15% of its workforce globally, which amounts to roughly 450 people losing their jobs, the manufacturer said on Friday, according to Reuters.
The Geely-owned carmaker builds the all-electric Polestar 2 liftback, Polestar 3 SUV, and Polestar 4 coupe-like SUV that has no rear window. A low-slung four-door flagship sedan dubbed Polestar 5 is also in the works.
Another EV player gets a reality check
After missing its sales target for 2023, Swedish-based EV maker Polestar said it plans to cut about 450 jobs worldwide, or approximately 15% of its workforce, citing ""challenging market conditions.""
""As part of this business plan, we need to adjust the size of our business and operations,” a Polestar spokesperson said. “This involves reducing external spend and, regrettably, also our number of employees.""
More Polestar Stories
With a portfolio that until recently only had one model–the Polestar 2–Volvo’s sister company has been struggling to get sales and profit take off. At the beginning of the year, the automaker, which plans to start U.S. production this quarter, missed its delivery targets for 2023. In Q4 of last year, Polestar sold about 12,800 EVs worldwide, a 39% decrease in volume compared to the same period in 2022.
""Polestar continues to protect its exclusive brand position in what remains a challenging market, resulting in fewer deliveries in the fourth quarter, and now expects a gross profit margin for the full year of around break-even,"" the marque said regarding its disappointing results.
That said, the company’s full-year sales numbers saw a slight increase of 6%, but it was not enough to reach the updated guidance of 60,000-70,000 sales in 2023, as the year ended with roughly 54,600 sales. Initially, Polestar hoped to sell 80,000 EVs last year.
Despite smaller numbers, the company’s head honcho remained optimistic about what’s to come. “[The] Polestar 4 has been very well received in China and ramping up production was an important milestone for us,” said Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO at the beginning of January. “Sales of our SUV coupé will start in Europe and Australia in the coming weeks. With the first deliveries of [the] Polestar 3 expected in the summer, our shift from being a one to three-car company positions us for a transformative and exciting 2024,” he added.",Iulian Dnistran
Porsche Thinks Europe's 2035 Combustion Engine Ban Might Be Delayed,https://www.motor1.com/news/706202/porsche-thinks-combustion-engine-ban-could-be-dealyed/,"Plus, Lincoln is eliminating 100 dealers in the United States in 2023 after cutting 100 last year.",12/25/2024 7:31,"Porsche CFO believes sales of new cars with combustion engines could continue in the European Union after 2035, and Lincoln is cutting 100 dealers in the United States this year.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Porsche Thinks The Combustion Engine Could Survive Beyond 2035 in The EU
Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke attended the world premiere of the Macan EV this week in Singapore where he let it slip the combustion engine's future might not be as dark as claimed. Speaking with Automotive News Europe, the company's CFO said: ""There's a lot of discussions right now around the end of the combustion engine. I think it could be delayed.""
He was referring to the sales ban on new cars with combustion engines in the European Union from 2035. For the sake of clarity, the ban refers to cars that generate emissions, so in theory, hydrogen-burning combustion engines or ones that run on synthetic fuels could be allowed. In March 2023, Reuters reported on the European Commission's draft to allow sales of new ICE cars after 2035 provided the vehicles run on climate neutral fuels.
Later in September, the news agency followed-up with a story about another draft demanding automakers to demonstrate that their cars can run entirely on e-fuels that are carbon neutral.
In the case of Porsche, the Zuffenhausen-based marque projects more than 80 percent of cars delivered globally annually will be EVs by 2030. In the meantime, a gas model will be prematurely retired in the European Union where the first-generation Macan will cease to exist later this year due to upcoming cybersecurity regulations. The fully electric, second-generation model will indirectly take its place, but at a much higher price tag.
Lincoln Will Remove 100 Dealers In The US This Year
Ford's luxury brand will be streamlining its dealer network in the United States furthermore this year. After deleting 100 dealers last year, another 100 will be cut in 2024. That means Lincoln is going to have approximately 400 showrooms by the end of the year.
Most dealers are joined at the hip with a Ford store. Speaking with Automotive News, Lincoln President Dianne Craig said Lincoln retailers that agree with the buyout will receive in exchange additional Ford inventory. Another perk will be to offer incentive plans for returning customers.
In 2023, Buick, another American luxury brand, nearly halved its dealer footprint, concluding the year with approximately 1,000 showrooms. Parent company General Motors has compelled Buick dealerships to decide on whether to invest in EV tooling and training or accept a buyout. Buick ended 2023 with 47 percent fewer dealers compared to the beginning of the year.

"Nissan, Behind On EVs, Delays Two U.S.-Made EVs To 2026 And 2027: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/704637/nissan-delays-us-made-evs/,"The two EVs, a Nissan and an Infiniti, will be made in Canton, Mississippi—just later than expected.",1/15/2024 9:35,"Nissan has reportedly postponed the production start of two brand-new, U.S.-made electric vehicles that will be manufactured at the company’s Canton, Mississippi plant, according a supplier memo obtained by Automotive News.
The two EVs are reportedly meant to be a pair of sporty sedans based on an all-new platform, one badged as a Nissan and the other one bearing the Infiniti logo. Initially, production was scheduled to begin in 2025, but the date was pushed back by one year, according to a supplier production schedule that was unearthed by Automotive News last year. Those sedans could even bear some historic nameplates like Skyline and Maxima.
Nissan, an electric pioneer, struggles to keep up
Once ahead of the pack with the Leaf, Nissan is now playing catch-up to many competitors. Its EV crossover, the Ariya, has received mixed-to-positive reviews but has been dogged by production issues in Japan.
After the initial setback, newer supplier memos suggested the two new EVs were postponed another three months, and now, according to the latest information gathered by Automotive News, the production start of the two sedans is said to be delayed by two more months.
More Nissan EV Stories
In other words, the two all-new electric vehicles that were supposed to debut next year will reportedly see the light of day starting toward the end of 2026. The Nissan sedan, codenamed LZ1F, will go into production in November 2026, while the output of the Infiniti EV, codenamed LZ1E, will start in April 2027, as per Automotive News.
The reason for all these delays? One source told the publication that Nissan has concerns about the profitability and market demand for EVs. The Japanese automaker cited ""the need to enhance product competitiveness"" for its latest delay.
Sales of battery-powered vehicles crossed the 1.2 million mark last year, but multiple analysts and even automaker executives are saying that growth isn't happening as quickly as they once anticipated. Nissan may have been spooked by this outcome and decided to wait.
One point of contention is the increasing EV inventory in the country, which is an indicator of how fast (or slow) people are buying zero-emissions cars. According to Cox Automotive, EV inventory rose by 92% last year, with an average 113-day supply at the end of 2023. Compare that to the average days’ supply of 69 overall and the potential problems become clear.
That said, some manufacturers seem to go against the public’s wishes when it comes to churning out electric cars. While it’s commendable that Nissan wants to dive head-on into the sedan segment, a recent J.D. Power study found that EV adoption rates could be higher if more affordable compact SUVs were introduced.
Moreover, this reported decision is yet another setback for Nissan, which was once an early leader in the electric space with the Leaf. Infiniti's aging lineup has no EVs or hybrids, and the Nissan brand solely has the Ariya, which has faced a number of production challenges in Japan and does not qualify for U.S. tax credits. Betting on a much later date for wider EV adoption could put it more in line with future demand—or even further behind the curve.
Nevertheless, Nissan executives told us in Japan last year that they remain steadfast on an electric future, including plans to axe all non-EVs in Europe by 2030, more lower-cost EVs and the development of solid-state batteries.",Iulian Dnistran

The company says that it is ""rebalancing"" the numbers in its fleets, which means selling off a third of its EV fleet and replacing those cars with ICE models.
According to Automotive News, Hertz said that it expects to sell off 20,000 cars in its EV stock, and that process already started as early as last month. The cash generated from the sales of its EV fleet will be pumped back into meeting demand for rental ICE vehicles. This comes on the heels of Hertz’s October announcement that it would be scaling back its EV operations, citing high repair costs and reduced residual value compared to the rest of its vehicles as reasons why its EV rental operations weren’t going so well.
The rental car industry is having a reckoning moment with EVs
Rental car customers have had a lot of frustrations with EVs last year, leading big players like Hertz to now focus on gas cars instead.
To some anti-EV pundits, Hertz is getting its just desserts. To them, Hertz has overinvested in a technology that isn’t proven, ready, or wanted by consumers. Now it has to pay the piper for overbuying a fleet of cars that no one wanted.
But is that what’s actually going on here?
True, the growth in demand for EVs has been a bit softer lately than many expected, but that information is likely immaterial to Hertz’s woes. Hertz has said that 80% of its EVs are Teslas, and although Hertz says that EVs come with higher repair costs, we can’t help but wonder: is this an EV thing, or is it a Tesla thing?
Hertz has claimed that damage and collision costs are high for its EV rentals. Given Tesla’s higher-than-average insurance costs and notoriously long and expensive repair times, it almost feels as if the concept of EV running and repair costs have been conflated as being an EV thing, rather than a more specific Tesla-adjacent problem. (Hertz has not responded to a request for comment from InsideEVs.)
Moreover, not long after it started purchasing Teslas, price cuts as well as the reintroduction of the $7,500 new EV tax credit meant the Model 3 and Model Y became dramatically cheaper. Sometimes literally overnight. Those cars settled down in the mid-$30,000 range and low $40,000 range, respectively. That may be good for consumers in search of a deal, but it had the effect of hurting resale value. Hertz had effectively overpaid for vehicles that it would not be able to get anywhere near as much of a return on when it was time for them to be sold, and resales are a huge source of revenue for rental companies.
Other automakers may have cut prices, but none as dramatically and carte blanche as Tesla. These problems aren’t just affecting rental companies, as Tesla owners have openly and loudly alleged that reduced residual values due to price cuts have abnormally hurt their resale value.
But again, that's more of a Tesla problem, rather than an EV problem. The rental car company Sixt seems to recognize this, it still plans to electrify 90% of its rental fleet, but it’s pivoting away from Tesla for similar reasons as Hertz.
(It's worth noting that while the bulk of Hertz's EV fleet is—or was—comprised of Teslas, it also purchased a substantial amount of Polestar 2s as well. It's unclear whether those cars suffered with the same repair cost issues, although we do know they tended to have low resale values as well.)
Finally, it's worth noting that Hertz and other rental car companies haven't exactly nailed the experience and education part of the EV piece. It’s not hard to find a consumer who rented an EV from Hertz and encountered bad customer service, got surprised with an EV and no explanation as to how it works, or received any instruction on how and where to charge.
Heck, I rented a Kia EV6 from Hertz last April in Phoenix. The experience was more than slightly frustrating; I was given a car with a 50% state of charge despite the reservation asserting that the car would be at or close to 100%. I needed to go to Tuscon, about two hours away, and I hadn’t planned or researched online where I could DC fast charge near PHX airport. It’s not fun trying to find an accessible DC fast charger in an unfamiliar city when you’re on a time crunch.
I’m paid to understand these things so perhaps I am naturally more prone to suffering than a normal driver. However, I couldn’t help that this experience could make the average renter hate EVs.
Still, a reduction in the EV fleet doesn’t mean that Hertz is eliminating its fleet entirely. Hopefully, Hertz has learned a lesson here, and a smaller, more streamlined EV renting experience prevails.
On the flip side, the purge of 20,000 EVs from Hertz’s fleets means that used EV deals might be the name of 2024. Those $20,000 three-year-old Teslas might be the rule, not the exception.

"More Than 7,000 U.S. Car Dealers Sign Up For 'Point Of Sale' EV Credits",https://insideevs.com/news/702160/7000-dealers-register-point-of-sale-ev-credits/,Thousands of car dealers are about to make it easier—and cheaper—to buy an EV in 2024. Here's how.,12/24/2023 16:00,"Automotive dealers and electric vehicles, it’s not quite the match made in heaven. If 2023 was anything to go by, the schism was glaring—a year marked by staunch dealer rebellion against EVs. The resistance came in several ways, one of which was a letter signed by almost 4,000 dealerships to President Biden demanding to “slow down” the regulations favoring EV manufacturing and sales. Another one involved blatant lies to customers about the capabilities of EVs to coerce them into buying gas cars instead.
But 2024 could open a new chapter for American dealers, and allow them an opportunity to come clean. Fresh news out of Washington D.C. indicates that dealers might be willing to embrace EVs (or at least make a genuine attempt.) More than 7,000 American car dealers have registered with the IRS to provide tax credits to customers at the point of sale, the U.S. Department of Treasury said on Friday.
This means that EV buyers will get a discount of up to $7,500 right when they purchase the car at the dealership, without having to wait until tax season to file for a rebate.
U.S. car dealers signal support for updated tax credit provisions.
American car dealers were unwilling to sell EVs. But new IRS guidance, effective January 1, 2024, allows buyers to redeem tax credits right when they buy an EV. Thousands of dealers, surprisingly, support this provision.
The number of dealers who registered to offer point-of-sale credits to customers could be higher than 7,000, as per the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). “There are many more dealerships that are covered by those 7,000 registrations, and this does not include the many registration applications submitted but the IRS has not yet approved,” a NADA spokesperson told Automotive News. NADA's 2023 data showed 17,000 franchised dealerships in the U.S.
So far, buyers had to wait until after filing their tax return to claim the federal clean vehicle credit. This meant they would receive the credit several months after purchase. New guidance under the Inflation Reduction Act expedites this process. From January 1, 2024, buyers can drive home an EV by paying a reduced amount upfront, eliminating the need to wait to get their money back. (That’s theoretical, and we need to wait and see how it pans out in the real world.)
The year-long skullduggery, and downplaying of the vitality of EVs, was rooted in some genuine concerns. Investing in charging infrastructure and educating sales personnel requires significant financial commitment. Not to mention the lower sales commissions and after-sales profits. As EVs have fewer moving parts, they require less maintenance. No oil changes, and no need to replace spark plugs or fuel injectors. Despite these valid concerns, the signs are clear: Scientific consensus on the effects of global warming calls for an incontrovertible EV adoption, which many American dealers vehemently opposed.
The claim that “enthusiasm [for EVs] has stalled” was a highlight in the letter to Biden. But the new IRS guidance could be a morale booster for dealers. They now have a foolproof reason to attract customers. It could help them clear their piling EV inventories, make space for new batches, and in turn, spur manufacturing, which has taken a backseat for some carmakers. It’s a red carpet to take EVs seriously, end the cattiness, and give EPA’s emissions targets due consideration.

"These GM, Ford And Tesla EVs Will Lose Their Tax Credit On January 1, 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/702104/gm-ford-tesla-credit-2024/,"The effects may be temporary, but for now, they mean changes to the Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Mustang Mach-E and more.",12/22/2023 10:47,"Now that the rules around the changing electric vehicle tax credits have been finalized, we know more about what cars will and won't qualify for them come Jan. 1, 2024. For now, at least, quite a few models from General Motors, Ford and even Tesla will lose their credits.
GM said yesterday it expects the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV to lose eligibility for the U.S. EV tax credit starting next year, albeit only ""temporarily,"" according to a Detroit News report.
The tax credits are changing again in January
The tax credit system—which in January 2023 applied to almost every EV on sale—is now being slimmed down to prioritize cars whose battery materials aren't made in what the U.S. government calls a ""foreign entity of concern,"" specifically China. And due to China's power over the EV supply chain, that impacts quite a few cars. But automakers are quickly working to rectify that problem.
""After reviewing Treasury's long-awaited proposed guidance, we believe the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV will temporarily lose eligibility for the clean vehicle credit on Jan. 1, 2024 because of two minor components,"" GM spokesperson Liz Winter said in a statement to InsideEVs. The components in question are separators and electrolytes, according to the Detroit News story.
""While we await final rules, GM has pulled ahead sourcing plans for qualifying components in early 2024 and will advocate for our dealers and customers who purchase vehicles built ahead of the new guidance,"" Winter added. GM said it expects both electric SUVs to qualify for the credit again in early 2024, without providing a timeline.
The company added that the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Optiq produced ""after the sourcing change will be eligible for the full incentive."" Mind you, the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will remain eligible for the credit come January 1, 2024.
Interestingly, GM said it is committed to ""providing the equivalent EV tax credit purchase amount for any vehicles that became ineligible due to the new guidelines"" beginning in January, according to a letter to dealers signed by John Roth, vice president of Cadillac, and Scott Bell, vice president of Chevrolet, and seen by the Detroit News.
In other words, at least for now, it sounds like GM is going to give a similar discount to EVs until it sorts out the battery issues. We'll provide information on that as we get it.
Ford is also losing eligibility for some key EVs. The automaker announced that the E-Transit electric van and Mustang Mach-E will lose the $3,750 tax credit in 2024, while the Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring plug-in hybrid will also lose the $7,500 incentive.
The F-150 Lightning will remain eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, while the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrids will retain a $3,750 incentive.
As for Stellantis, it doesn't expect any changes for its plug-in hybrids. The Chrysler Pacifica minivan should continue to qualify for a $7,500 credit, while the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe SUVs should retain a $3,750 incentive.
Meanwhile, even Tesla is impacted by these changes. We know that the RWD and Long Range variants of the Tesla Model 3 will lose the $7,500 incentive in January, due to Chinese-sourced batteries. Tesla has said similar reductions may happen to the Model Y as well.
There are some upsides to the tax credit next year. Eligible consumers will get an immediate credit at the point of sale, without having to claim it on their taxes; it will work like a discount, basically. However, the big downside to that is that the list of eligible EVs in 2024 is a lot shorter, due to new rules on battery components and minerals.

E-Scooter Sharing Platform Bird Has Filed For Bankruptcy In The US,https://insideevs.com/news/702006/bird-escooter-bankruptcy-usa/,Bird’s Canadian and European operations will continue for the time being.,12/22/2023 9:39,"Electric scooters have been through quite a roller coaster ride in recent years. From being the darlings of the e-mobility space to pretty much becoming outcasts in many parts of the world, the electric scooter story can be considered tragic for some, with e-scooter sharing company Bird being the latest casualty of changing micromobility preferences.
Back when Bird went public in 2021, its stock was valued at more than $2 billion at the New York Stock Exchange. However, a year later in 2022, its stock price went into free fall and landed at a meager $70 million. The company was founded by Travis VanderZanden back in 2017. A former executive at Lyft and Uber, he saw a lot of potential in the e-scooter sharing industry. Eventually, Bird expanded and presently operates in 350 cities all over the world.
Despite its expansion, it seems the tides aren't in Bird’s favor. The company just recently filed for bankruptcy in the US, and stated that it has entered a “financial restructuring process” aimed to better position the company for long-term growth. This new restructuring process in applicable to Bird’s US operations, and makes it clear that the company’s Canadian and European operations will continue as before. For reference, a court filing states the Bird’s assets and liabilities are valued between $100 million to $500 million, and have initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for financial restructuring.
Michael Washinushi will retain his position as CEO of Bird for the time being, and is hopeful that the restructuring program will be able to turn Bird’s fortunes around. In the company’s official press release, he stated, “We are making progress toward profitability and aim to accelerate that progress by right-sizing our capital structure through this restructuring. We remain focused on our mission to make cities more livable by using micromobility to reduce car usage, traffic, and carbon emissions.""
More E-Mobility News:
While Bird’s operations in Canada and Europe remain undisturbed for now, many European countries haven’t been taking too kindly on the use of e-scooters for personal mobility. E-scooter sharing has been in quite a pinch in recent years, with dense European cities like Paris implementing an outright ban on e-scooter sharing, instead focusing on other e-mobility solutions such as electric bicycles.

US E-Bike Sales Have Quadrupled Since 2019 – What Could The Future Hold?,https://insideevs.com/news/701796/us-ebike-sales-400-percent-increase-4-years/,E-Bikes could hold the key to the future of urban mobility.,12/21/2023 9:29,"I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again: electric bicycles are rapidly reshaping the way people get around all over the world. This trend is most evident in Asia and Europe, as more and more people choose to leave their cars in their garages most of the week, and instead commute around town aboard their e-bikes. Indeed, I rode to the cafe in which I’m writing this article as we speak, and I only ever take my car out on longer trips or when I take my family with me.
While electric bicycle adoption is indeed most widespread in Europe and Asia, the growth of the segment can’t be ignored in the US market, even if for now, it mostly encompasses recreational vehicles and for-sport applications. A report by Business Insider which was echoed by the Office Of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy highlights the growth of the segment in the US market. According to the report, there were 325,000 e-bikes sold in the US in 2018. 2019 saw this drop to 287,000 units, however, when the global pandemic hit, it proved to be a massive boom for the e-bike industry.
Fast forward to 2022, and there were 1.1 million electric bicycles sold in the US, marking an almost 400-percent increase as those sold in 2019. If we look at this from a monetary perspective, 2019 raked in about $240 million in e-bike sales, while 2022 returned a whopping $885.5 million. Yes, the e-bike industry is fast approaching the one billion-dollar mark. In fact, we previously reported that the global e-bike industry could soon amount to $120 billion by 2030. Given the rapid growth of the segment, not just in the US, but the rest of the world, the industry could hit this milestone sooner than expected.
It’s also worth noting however, that while electric bicycle sales have skyrocketed in recent years, this wasn’t without its tradeoff. The non-electric bike market took a hit, with sales slumping by 16 percent in 2022. This is a clear indication that some cyclists are ditching leg-powered machines in favor of electrically assisted ones, and quite frankly, it’s easy to understand why this is the case. As it would turn out, slapping an electric motor onto a bike opens up all sorts of possibilities when it comes to its configuration, and so we’re seeing all sorts of cargo bikes, powerful off-road bikes, and even family e-bikes hit the market.
So, what does the future hold for e-bike adoption in the US? Well, there are currently some pretty attractive incentives for folks who buy an electric car, but the same incentives are hardly present for those looking to commute by bike. This could all be about to change, as the same report by Business Insider highlights that a group of congresspeople reintroduced the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act earlier in 2023.
Under the proposal, consumers could enjoy up to a 30-percent discount (up to $1,500 USD) on the purchase of a new e-bike. The law aims not only to make e-bikes more accessible, but also to encourage local governments to invest in bike-friendly infrastructure.

DHL Thinks Its Electric Trucks Are Just Right For The Country,https://insideevs.com/news/700734/dhl-electric-ohio-shipping-volvo/,These trucks use up to 50% less energy than a traditional Diesel truck on the same route.,12/14/2023 15:43,"When it comes to electrified issues, Ohio sometimes gets left behind. Whether that’s certain vehicles, state-level tax incentives or even a charging network as expansive as that of other states, we all collectively get skipped. It’s cool. We’re used to it. After all, California’s the biggest market for anything electrified. But that doesn’t mean Ohio—and other states that aren't California—are not somehow pivotal to understanding how and where we can get away from gas.
Many companies get this. Take DHL, the massive international logistics and shipping company with a regional headquarters in Westerville, Ohio. Shipping accounts for a lot of emissions. So as DHL attempts to electrify its fleets to address that problem, it's open about how states like Ohio can help it understand what the actual use cases are for EVs in the rest of the country. DHL invited me to Westerville to take a gander at an example of one of its new completely electric trucks—and hear about its plans to electrify shipping.
The trucking industry faces an emissions transformation too
From the Tesla Semi to experiments in hydrogen power, the trucking industry must also evolve to meet a future where emissions rules are much stricter. This story describes just one part of that effort.
DHL doesn’t do door-to-door parcels anymore here in the United States. No, it lost that battle in the late 2000s to UPS and FedEx. But DHL still does international deliveries, where it then turns over its packages to USPS, UPS, or FedEx letting them finish out those last packages. It also does contract shipping, where it manages curated clients shipping large items from one space to another. These new Class 8 tractor-trailers are meant to serve as last-mile delivery solutions for the clients it has.
The one on display in Ohio is one of the 17 trucks—including five compressed natural gas ones—it plans to have in service by the end of spring 2024.
I’ll admit, that might not sound like a lot of trucks, but DHL’s fleet isn’t super big. DHL’s President of Transportation, Jim Monkmeyer explained that it’s only about 1,500 trucks or so it has in its nationwide fleet, which currently do the same purpose as the EV trucks it has here. (And DHL already has 30,000 light-to-heavy duty EVs deployed all over the world.)
Keep in mind, these EV trucks aren’t meant to be long-haul, cross-country type operations, but more so last-mile deliveries meant for cities and other shorter runs. So in proportion, that’s not too bad. These trucks have tangible benefits, too. DHL found an EV truck consumed about 50% less energy than a diesel one when put on the same job. Switching to electric makes a lot of sense.
The truck itself on display at DHL’s Westerville campus was a fairly standard Volvo VNR class 8 truck, shown off in the smaller four-module battery pack. DHL’s Senior Director of Asset Management, Ted Valin, said that the company expects to get about 150 miles of range from this truck, and closer to 225 miles of range; enough to handle the local routes that DHL has in mind for the truck. DHL added that it has two Freightliner eCascadias entering service, which also have about the same range and performance as the battery-powered Volvo VNR. The company says the electric trucks get up to 250 miles on a single charge, which works well for regional hauling.
“One of the unique things we’re doing is testing them outside of the state of California,” Valin said. This testing allows the company to learn just what these trucks will do when faced with concerns like cold weather or snow, things that aren’t as much of an issue in the Golden State.
With those limitations in mind, DHL can effectively tweak its routes to ensure the truck will always have enough range to finish the job. “We’re gonna have [the trucks] in Columbus, Charlotte, Philadelphia, and even Middletown, Ohio,” Valin added.
Of course, ensuring those routes fall within their scope is key. Right now, DHL isn’t all that keen on investing in or relying on public charging infrastructure. The Volvo VNR uses the same CCS 1 combo port just like any other EV on the market. But for now, all of the charging for these vehicles will be done at the vehicle’s home base. DHL says that as the largest contract shipper in the US, its advantages are that it can effectively manage its charging needs, from dispatch. So right now, the company doesn’t really need public charging at all.
But plenty of trucking companies that do more long-haul freight work are getting into the charging game; this summer the Wall Street Journal reported Daimler Truck is working with renewable company NextEra Energy on a network designed to support the trucking industry. Right now, we're even seeing automakers not traditionally involved in ""fueling"" get into the charging game. It seems likely trucking companies will need to do something similar, too.
Perhaps most famously, PepsiCo has a small fleet of Tesla Semi trucks posting encouraging range results, and one large Coca-Cola distributor is also using Daimler Freightliner eCascadias too. These efforts are still in the early phases, but they may show eventual promise.
My conversation with Valin ended on a high note. He called himself a “true believer” in electrification, speaking on how much he loves his Tesla. The low maintenance allure of his EV is part of the reason he believes that these new EV Class 8 trucks will work out to be superior to the traditional ICE trucks.
For the handful already in DHL’s fleet, Monkmeyer and Valin both claimed that drivers appreciated how quiet, comfortable and quick these trucks were, allowing drivers to end shifts with less fatigue. In theory, the benefits of the truck itself could lead to DHL attracting and retaining drivers in a world where truck drivers are in short supply.
DHL plans to electrify 30% of its fleet by 2030. Could electric trucks make shipping cheaper and greener? It certainly beats the alternative.

Volkswagen Looking To Renault For Help Developing Cheap EV: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/700216/volkswagen-possible-tie-up-renault-cheap-ev/,"VW is falling behind its European competitors, so it’s looking for partnerships to help it regain lost ground.",12/11/2023 11:30,"A potential tie-up between Volkswagen and Renault that might result in a cheap electric car for the masses is in the works. And it can’t come soon enough, seeing how the German automaker has been in the spotlight recently for its EV-related woes, while Renault seems to be on a roll.
According to the German newspaper Handesblatt cited by Automotive News Europe, VW wants to cooperate on a platform that will underpin its upcoming $21,500 (€20,000), and so it started discussions with Renault. The source, citing people familiar with the matter, notes that the talks are still “at a very early stage” and that they could lead to nothing.
As luck would have it, Renault recently revealed its next-generation Twingo EV concept that’s slated to become a series-production car in 2026 boasting an impressive energy consumption of 160.9 watt-hours per mile. That’s 50% more efficient than current small EVs.
At the same time, Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said last month that the namesake automaker is working on a sub-$21,500 EV that could become a reality by the second half of the decade. Mind you, this is not the EV that will be inspired by the ID. 2all concept revealed in the spring–that one will be a bit bigger and will reportedly cost under $27,000 (€25,000).
So at first glance, it might seem that if the stars align just right, we could see a Volkswagen and Renault tie-up that will fight the incoming wave of cheap-ish battery-powered cars from China. At least in Europe, that is.
More Affordable EVs
On the Old Continent, Stellantis–which owns more brands than I have fingers, including Peugeot and Citroen–seems to be doing better than VW in the EV game. The Citroen e-C3 was recently launched with a starting price tag of about $24,500 and more affordable models are set to be shipped from China thanks to a partnership between Stellantis and Leapmotor.
This wouldn’t be the first time Renault collaborated with a rival automaker to develop an EV. Back in 2020, the French carmaker debuted the current-gen Twingo ZE which is more or less the same car as the discontinued Smart EQ ForFour sold by Daimler.

Volkswagen Will Cut Staffing Costs By A Fifth As Part Of Group's $10.8B Savings Plan (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/699903/vw-to-cut-staffing-costs-fifth/,VW brand CEO Thomas Schaefer said last week that the carmaker is “no longer competitive.”,12/11/2023 10:24,"Correction: An earlier version of this story conflated VW Group employees with VW brand employees; only the latter faces these staff cuts. We regret the error.
Volkswagen’s woes are taking turns for a place under the spotlight. After pausing production at some of its electric vehicle factories in Europe citing weak demand and the brand’s CEO saying that it was “no longer competitive,” the people’s car manufacturer has released more details about the parent group's $10.8 billion savings plan that should put it back on track.
According to Automotive News Europe, citing an internal memo, the VW brand plans to cut administrative staff costs by a fifth. Last year, the German car group that bears the same name had 675,000 employees worldwide.
Volkswagen said it will not resort to layoffs. Instead, the staffing cuts will happen by way of partial and early retirement, the internal memo mentioned.
Besides the restructuring, VW will reduce the product cycles from 50 months or a little over four years to just three years. This means we should see facelifted and new-generation models one year earlier during their lifetime. Furthermore, a planned $862 million (€800 million) research and development site in Wolfsburg, Germany will no longer be built.

In the previous decade, Volkswagen produced about 780,000 cars on average per year at its plant in Wolfsburg. By comparison, this year the company hopes to achieve 500,000 units, which is far below its previous achievements. ""At the end of November, after 11 out of 12 months, we have produced 453,000 vehicles,"" works council head Daniela Cavallo said for Automotive News Europe.
""We will need to operate with fewer people in many areas at Volkswagen in the future,"" brand boss Thomas Schaefer told employees at a meeting in Wolfsburg on Wednesday. ""This doesn't mean more work for fewer people, but rather shedding old habits and saying no to duplicating efforts and inefficiencies,” he added.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Tesla Cybertruck Has Strong Sales Potential, But Only If US Buyers Step Up",https://insideevs.com/news/700013/tesla-cybertruck-sales-potential/,Tesla has done very well globally. But Cybertruck is aimed at the US market where electric trucks aren't popular.,12/9/2023 13:31,"Much has been written about the Tesla Cybertruck since it was first unveiled as a prototype in December 2019. Last week was the launch of the production version and, as expected, media coverage has skyrocketed.
This truck is an evolution of the pickup in many ways. Its bold design, numerous features, interesting solutions, and positioning in the market make it one of this year's most important revelations. But what is its real impact on Tesla's sales volume and global markets?
The Cybertruck is arguably Tesla's most capable vehicle, combining true hypercar acceleration (0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds) with pickup practicality and room for five in the cabin. Thanks to the capabilities of its batteries and software, Tesla has managed to shake up not only major electric vehicle markets, but also the industry in general. The Cybertruck is the confirmation of this trend.
With an entry price of $61,000, the Cybertruck isn't exactly cheap. The price is a far cry from the $40,000 Musk promised four years ago and is the result of inflation and real-world production challenges. However, this is a competitive base price for a vehicle with these features. The volume-weighted average retail price of electric pickup trucks sold in the US between January and September 2023 was $82,835.
On the other hand, the cheapest rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck won't be available until 2025, and it costs $11,000 more than the least expensive Ford F-150 Lightning. The Chevrolet Silverado EV will also have a price tag of several thousand dollars less, so Tesla won't have the luxury of simply undercutting Detroit brands in a price war.
Things are different at the other end of the pricing scale. The most expensive Cybertruck, officially called the Cyberbeast, has 845 horsepower and can travel up to 320 miles on a single charge. Its price is $99,990, which in this case, works out to be more affordable than its closest rival, the GMC Hummer EV Pickup. While that truck has 1,000 hp, it's also heavier by over 2,000 pounds and is slower than Cybertruck. The maximum range is a bit better at 381 miles, but the flagship GMC Hummer EV 3X trim starts at $106,945. Rivian is competitive price-wise, but still a bit slower than the Cyberbeast.
As such, the latest Tesla seems competitive compared to its rivals in the United States. Given its performance, capabilities, and price, it could do very well in the US market where pickup trucks rule the roads. Of course, this depends on buyers stepping away from traditional combustion engines to adopt electric power.
Americans are buying EVs. Between January and October 2023, a total of 959,000 new light-duty electric vehicles were sold in the United States. While this is a solid 60 percent increase over the same period in 2022, these vehicles only accounted for 7.4 percent of the total market. Meanwhile, battery electric vehicles were 15 percent of the European total and around 20 percent in China.
The electric pickup segment is still fairly unpopular in the States. Their sales represented less than 3 percent of total EVs through October. The F-150 Lightning sold just 16,200 units in its first 10 months, according to JATO Dynamics. While electric vehicles accounted for nearly 9 percent of total SUV sales, electric pickup trucks accounted for 1.2 percent of the segment's total.
For Cybertruck to succeed, it must win in North America. Tesla has created the world's best-selling car in the Model Y thanks to strong sales around the globe, but the Cybertruck doesn't have that same global potential. Big pickups are only popular in the United States and Canada.
Will the Cybertruck bring attention to electric trucks? I'm sure, yes. However, America's pickup culture is only as strong as its connection to gasoline. Changing this situation will require a different approach. Consumers in the truck market likely won't take to electric power as easily as those in other segments, such as SUVs.

China Pushes Back On Biden's New EV Tax Credit Rules,https://insideevs.com/news/699883/china-biden-ira-rules/,China thinks the new rules run counter to the spirit of the World Trade Organization.,12/8/2023 10:17,"Not everyone’s a fan of the Biden Administration’s new rules for the Inflation Reduction Act. The latest entity to push back on the new rules is China. The IRA’s revisions add new, stricter regulations on battery materials, making things a lot harder for EV manufacturers, and causing China to call foul play.
Basically, the Biden Administration’s revisions remove eligibility for vehicle tax credits if more than trace amounts of battery materials come from countries deemed a ""Foreign Entity of Concern,” or FEOC for short. That could mean North Korea, Russia, Iran, and now China – a big deal. In 2024, completed batteries that are made with components made by FEOCs make a vehicle ineligible, and by 2025 EVs that have battery minerals that go beyond trace amounts that come from FEOCs, also will not qualify. It’s why some variants of the Tesla Model 3 won’t be eligible for the full tax credit next year, and the Mustang Mach-E is now completely ineligible in 2024.

According to a report from Reuters, China has pushed back, asserting that this policy runs counter to WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. China says this policy is exclusionary and is a “ typical non-market orientated policy.” China also asserts that other WTO members have expressed concern about the policy, also agreeing that it violates the basic principles of the WTO. China thinks these policies could seriously impede and disrupt international trade and investment.
Is China right? It’s not quite clear yet, nor is it arguably all that important to the goal of getting drivers away from gas, and into EVs. Right now, this new policy could have a cooling effect on the EV market. Many EV battery packs for sale in cars on lots today, have significant Chinese content, and it’s not exactly possible to change those vehicles to an approved source overnight. Likewise, the potential for Biden to institute a 25% ownership cap on FEOC investment in companies could make plans, like Ford’s planned CATL joint venture battery plant, significantly more complicated. That plant in theory should make things easier for Ford to assemble battery packs stateside and thus make its EVs requalify for subsidies, but if the CATL plant is hurt by Biden’s new rules, then it’s all pretty much for naught.",Kevin Williams
"'Great For The Industry': Ford, Others Get Tesla Cybertruck 48V System Specs",https://insideevs.com/news/699798/tesla-shares-cybertruck-48v-architecture/,This might spark another technological shift in the industry.,12/7/2023 13:24,"The Tesla Cybertruck is equipped with an all-new 48-volt low-voltage system, which replaces the outdated but still the popular, 12-volt system.
This move from 12- to 48 volts for auxiliary onboard devices was confirmed by Tesla during the 2023 Investor Day in March and applied in the final product as promised.
*The main traction battery system that runs the drive units is a high-voltage one with a nominal voltage of over 800 volts.
The main benefit of higher voltage for auxiliary devices is that the same power can be supplied at a lower current, which directly lowers the current losses and allows the use of thinner wires to save weight and cost. Large vehicles already were using 24-volt systems, but 48-volt is still a rare solution in cars.
Tesla does not intend to stop there by simply moving from 12 volts to 48 volts for its own electric vehicles. The automaker would like to help spread the 48-volt architecture through the industry.
This is why Tesla sent the 48-volt system specs to other manufacturers and Ford CEO Jim Farley just confirmed that he received it.
Considering his response ""Great for the industry!"" we can assume that Ford will be willing to implement a 48-volt system in its vehicles as well, potentially starting with some next-generation all-electric vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk also responded, ""You're welcome."" Perhaps we'll soon see some other manufacturers hint at 48 volts now.
Update: In a following post, Jim Farley said: ""Great to read the document and realize that our next-gen team has been on a similar path. Let’s work together to help the supply base move into the 48V future as well."" This clearly indicates that the next-generation Ford all-electric vehicles will also have a 48-volt system.
Despite many obvious benefits, the automotive industry is sometimes very slow to change the things that work for something better.
The switch from 12 volts to 48 volts is not as simple as one would think, because it requires redesigning vehicle wiring and (at least in most cases) all new electric components (every motor, light, sensor, and chip) or at least ensuring that they can operate at a higher voltage.
The issues are that this requires investment, there are not that many suppliers of parts and there is no economy of scale at the beginning. The changes also mean that all of the service centers need to be ready for the new low-voltage system.
With Tesla's template of a 48-volt low-voltage system, the rest of the industry might be willing to develop their own solution—first, because it will be easier to start from something rather than from scratch, and secondly, because now the competition is one step ahead.
Following the first Tesla Cybertruck deliveries, Munro Live's Sandy Munro had an opportunity to speak with Elon Musk about the 48-volt system and issues that prevented such a move in the past.
Let's also recall that in new electric cars, Tesla still uses a 12-volt low-voltage system, but already managed to switch from the typical lead-acid auxiliary batteries to 12-volt lithium-ion auxiliary batteries. The switch was announced in February 2021, and initially launched in the refreshed Tesla Model S/Model X (starting with the Plaid) - see an in-depth teardown here - and later used also in the Model 3/Model Y (in late 2021).
We haven't seen the Tesla Cybertruck's auxiliary battery yet, and an online manual has not yet been released but we assume that the new 48-volt battery in the Tesla Cybertruck is also a lithium-ion battery. The question is what type of battery cells (and from whom) were used?

Rental Company Sixt Phases Out Tesla EVs From Fleet,https://insideevs.com/news/699689/tesla-sixt-ev-fleet/,"The German rental car giant says the reduced residual value, and high repair costs as the reasons why it's dropping Teslas.",12/6/2023 18:08,"The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y’s price cuts sure have been a boon to regular consumers. In many places, all across the world, the Model 3 and Model Y top the EV sales charts because it’s such a good deal. It offers aspirational luxury at a price that’s only a little bit more than mainstream brands. But, not everyone’s happy with Tesla’s price cuts. According to a report from Bloomberg, German-based rental car company Sixt has announced that it’s phasing out Tesla electric rental cars from its fleets because of reduced resale costs.
Sixt isn’t the first rental car company to push back on EVs. A few months ago, Hertz announced that its EV rentals were a money loser, with many of the benefits extolled by EV advocates never materializing. The cars broke down more often than expected and were more expensive to repair than the comparable ICE car. To add insult to injury, Hertz bought much of its fleet at the height of Tesla’s price wars – Tesla severely cut its pricing not long after it ordered hundreds of cars. The resultant price cuts and surge in sales have hurt resale value, Hertz said that residuals of EVs as a whole have dropped by about a third. For a rental company that will periodically replace its fleet, that’s not great news.
More EV Rental Info
Sixt has a similar reasoning. High repair costs and lower residuals due to the reduced pricing have the brand thinking twice. However, whereas Hertz focused on slowing its investment in EVs as a whole, Sixt is specifically targeting Tesla vehicles. Sixt says that it still plans to electrify 90% of its fleet by the end of the decade, but at least for the foreseeable future, it probably won’t include new Tesla vehicles.
Is this a sign of trouble in the EV world? Maybe. Tesla’s elevated repair costs and reduced residuals are likely mostly a Tesla problem, but there have been data that shows that EVs in general cost more to repair. A Consumer Reports survey recently showed that proportionally, EV drivers have complained about reliability woes more than ICE cars. These problems range from infotainment or build quality issues, but also battery, motor, and charging issues.
Hopefully, manufacturers get these issues under control, electric vehicles should be simpler and easier to own than ICE vehicles.",Kevin Williams
The Tesla Cybertruck Could Be An Insurance And Repair Nightmare,https://insideevs.com/news/699189/tesla-cybertruck-repair-insurance/,"DeLorean enthusiasts, body shop technicians, and insurance agents all weigh in on Tesla's stainless steel truck.",12/5/2023 16:34,"Elon Musk has delivered on his promise to get the Tesla Cybertruck into production. The wedge-shaped, Syd Mead meets Giorgetto Giugiaro design is out in the world, albeit with some design concessions from the concept version to make the whole package work. It might not go as far as originally promised, it’s more expensive than he originally said it would be, but the Cybertruck still looks very close to the concept Musk surprised us with back in 2019—stainless steel body panels and all. Those stainless steel body panels might be one of the truck’s biggest draws, but could they be its Achilles heel?
Musk and Tesla claim that the truck's hard surface is so damage-resistant that it can stop bullets. But like every material in the known physical realm, it can be broken. And when something gets broken, it’ll need to be repaired. That's where things get tricky here.
After all, there are only about a baker’s dozen’s worth of production Cybertrucks on the road. Coupled with Tesla’s notoriously rigorous and tight-lipped stance toward its trade secrets about repairability, we won’t know the explicit, granular details of how to repair the Cybertruck until there are more than a few on the road, and rumblings about the truck in private, go public.
Still, we all have eyes. The Cybertruck isn’t the first electric truck, not the first Tesla, and not the first vehicle to be made of stainless steel.
To get an idea of what Cybetruck owners might be in for when the going gets tough for their trucks, I reached out to a few sources familiar with autobody repair, stainless steel repair, fixing Teslas specifically, and other people with expert knowledge in this field.
The picture they painted is cautiously optimistic at best, but also earnest about the challenges the truck’s design presents. And those experts are adamant about how the truck could further test the often-contentious relationships between the consumer, auto body technicians and the insurance industry.
The Cybertruck is unusually stiff. Its 3mm thick stainless steel panels are undoubtedly an industry first. Musk bragged that traditional auto presses, which can exert literal tons of force, can’t even shape the stuff because it’s so thick and hard. It’s silly to expect that a standard PDR (paintless dent removal) guy could use their tools to hammer out any dents. Yet, not considering the Cybertruck’s proprietary metal alloy and absurd thickness, we already have at least a bit of a precedent of how to repair stainless steel—an example from the 1980s, when DeLoreans were still new and probably more on the road than they are today.
It takes a lot of labor to ensure the body panels remain straight and usable. Then, unlike normal car steel (or even aluminum) body panels, you can’t hide structurally sound, but visually unappealing, repairs behind body filler and paint since the trucks are unpainted. So, every repair has to be pitch-perfect, which isn’t easy, and, more crucially, very time-consuming.
This is why the stories behind painted DeLoreans often come from accident-involved vehicles; it didn’t make any financial sense to spend hours repairing a stainless steel panel. Instead, some owners and body shop guys would use traditional techniques involving body filler, and then opt to paint the car.
“Repairing stainless steel is a novelty,” said Josh Bengston, owner and operator of DeLorean Industries, in Tallmadge, Ohio. His company repairs DMC-12s and sells parts for them. Although our conversation was short, Bengston was pointed and direct. Repairing stainless steel really only makes sense for classic and collector cars like the DeLorean where replacements might not exist, and the cars themselves are special, rare items for hobbyists.
James Espey, president of another shop, Classic DMC, was a little more optimistic. But he agreed that the labor to repair stainless steel isn’t easy. Espey described some of the repair processes of DeLorean panels as “old school,” where they’re using pick and files, not the computerized body shop tools to beat out divots and dings. It’s an art form that takes a lot more time than the average steel fender. “If you're going to spend more than say, eight, nine hours trying to do a repair, you’re better off just buying a new (panel),” Espey said.
Those concerns of an elevated labor cost were shared amongst a Facebook group full of novice and veteran auto body repair technicians. Sure, the Cybertruck’s panels will potentially be able to be repaired like DeLoreans were, but there’s the big question: will insurance companies approve labor-intensive repairs? High labor totals out cars; they’re why one Ohio driver’s Rivian R1T repair came out to a whopping $42,000 for what appeared to be a basic fender bender. High repair bills like that are the things that total out trucks, as some Rivian owners are learning.
Replacing panels would likely be significantly quicker (and thus represent lower labor costs) than repairing them, insisting on replacing rather than repairing could open up a new can of worms. Arguably, it’s only exacerbating the current stress points Tesla owners are already experiencing with their insurance companies: long waits for repair times, and high repair costs, even before Tesla’s controversial choice to go with stainless steel panels.
More Cybertruck
“So a lot of customers hire me to fight insurance companies because insurance companies do not want to pay what Tesla requires you do to return a vehicle to pre-loss condition,” said Billy Walkowiak, the CEO of Collision Safety Consultants, a firm in part meant to serve as an advocate and adjudicator for insurance claimants who may not feel like the insurance company is effectively making them whole. “I personally probably do 10 to 15 Teslas a week,” he said.
Walkowiak explained that although we can’t quite yet know what’s going to happen with the Cybertruck, Tesla’s repair procedures have historically skewed toward replacement of parts, rather than repairing parts strategy. Add in the complicated software recalibration procedures and elevated labor costs—only Tesla-certified technicians can repair Tesla vehicles—and it all gets expensive very quickly. Walkowiak shared a Tesla Model 3 claim that was $22,000, with $14,000 of that solely being replacement parts. Yikes.
“Tesla's getting challenged because insurance companies now have their greedy little hands into the estimating software program,"" Walkowiak said. ""And they can say that they don’t believe it needs that we [the body shop says] because according to the [insurance company’s] software, it doesn't need that, or [they’re] not paying for that, or that's too expensive.""
Be that as it may, the replacement parts strategy that will likely apply to the Cybertruck could create a new problem: can Tesla even make enough parts to keep up?
“I remember reading stories in the automotive trade press about how replacement parts for the Model S and the 3 the Y, and the X were all short supply items because they were building everything they could make. [Tesla] hadn't allocated enough spare parts is how I understood it,” Espey added.
Tesla’s part repair woes have gotten somewhat better in recent years, but it’s not all that hard to find reports on social media of Tesla owners upset that their repairs take a long time, with wait times upward of six months. “The DeLorean company was really good about making every dealer buy a certain subset of spare parts, including body panels,"" Epsey said. “Is every Tesla service center going to have body panels on hand to ship?”
He also cast doubt on any availability of outside OEM parts. Since the Cybertruck is purportedly using a custom stainless steel alloy, it’s not clear if third-party companies will be able to create aftermarket body panels for the truck.
Still, Espey wasn't all doom and gloom on the Cybetruck. Later in our conversation, he compared the Cybertruck’s stainless steel panels to the Ford F-150’s aluminum body—something that was intensely controversial when it first came out.
Of course, there are some lingering feelings about the costs and techniques of repairing an aluminum car, but by and large, the auto body repair industry has adapted. (The vast popularity of the F-150 has a way of doing that.) These days, aluminum body repair is kind of a non-issue, although some body shop guys do insist the elevated costs associated with repairing them are still very much an issue.
Employees at another Ohio body shop I spoke to (that includes a 7,000-square-foot dedicated EV repair space) were more optimistic too. They insisted Tesla usually gives out good training on how to repair its vehicles, a sentiment seconded by other industry professionals I surveyed for this story. It's very possible the automaker—which does not speak to the press in America—has a plan for repairs that we're not privy to yet.
However, collision repair involves more than just the physical act of pulling out a dent and paying a body shop guy. There are a lot of moving pieces at work here, and it’s not clear how the Cybertruck will fare when the chips fall where they may.",Kevin Williams
EV Adoption Is Slow Because There Aren’t Enough Affordable Compact SUVs: J.D. Power,https://insideevs.com/news/699388/ev-adoption-slow-because-few-mass-market-compact-suvs-exist-jd-power/,A lackluster charging infrastructure and high prices are also among the reasons why Americans reject EVs.,12/5/2023 12:46,"There’s been a lot of conflicting news lately about the American electric car market. On the one hand, some new EVs are collecting dust for weeks on end on dealer lots, while others are selling like hotcakes.
While contrasting, both are true. But why? Well, J.D. Power’s latest E-Vision Intelligence Report for November 2023 tries to shed some light on the issue.
First, the problem of swollen dealer inventories. According to J.D. Power, the majority of reasons–7 in 10–quoted by people who are considering buying an EV simply do not exist in the case of combustion engines: lack of charging station availability, time required to charge, limited driving distance, and inadequate performance during extreme temperatures. Pricing is also an issue, with most EVs being more expensive than their ICE counterparts.
As for the record sales numbers seen by some manufacturers, the story is a bit more complicated that it first seems because the rate at which sales of battery-powered cars are advancing is still quite slow. According to J.D. Power, we’re still very much in the “early adopter” phase seeing how EVs account for just 8.2% of total new-vehicle sales in the United States.
It’s true that adoption is expected to rise in the following years, with a projected 13% by the end of next year, 19% by the end of 2025, and 24% by the end of 2026, but as it stands today, EVs are few and far between when looking at the big picture.
The main reason for this is that there isn’t enough choice where it matters, and that’s in the mainstream compact SUV segment, which is the biggest vehicle segment in the United States, with a market 16.5% market share. Not the premium compact SUV piece of the pie–that’s well taken care of, with 49.6% of sales represented by EVs.
More EV Stories
J.D. Power says that just 6% of all the non-premium compact SUVs sold are EVs, which is not enough to put a dent in the big scheme of things, and the pricing gap between comparable electric and combustion SUVs is a big factor.
As per the research company, the average retail price for a mass-market compact SUV is $52,000, while the average MSRP for a similar gas-powered vehicle is $34,000, or $18,000 less. For the price difference alone one could buy a brand-new Nissan Versa, Mitsubishi Mirage, or Kia Rio.
However, the premium compact SUV segment sees a smaller difference of just $4,000, with a new EV in this category costing $58,000 on average, while a comparable ICE vehicle goes for $54,000 on average. Yes, it’s more money, but a customer who’s willing to pay over $50,000 for a new car will be more inclined to take a second look at EVs because the price difference compared to ICE is not that big.
So what not-quite-premium crossovers can you get for less than $40,000? Not too many, unfortunately–at least right now–with the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Volvo EX30 among the few options on the table currently. The upcoming Fisker Pear is slated to cost just a smidge under $30,000 when it arrives in 2025, but we’ll believe it when we see it rolling off the assembly line.

"The Next Chevy Bolt Will Arrive In 2025, CEO Mary Barra Confirms",https://insideevs.com/news/699392/next-gen-chevrolet-bolt-ev-is-on-for-2025-debut-gm-ceo-confirms/,We finally have a launch year for the future LFP battery-powered Chevy Bolt.,12/5/2023 9:40,"After announcing a reversal of its cancellation this summer and letting some additional details out in October, General Motors has finally confirmed that the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV will debut in 2025.
GM CEO Mary Barra made this announcement yesterday at the Automotive Press Association in Detroit, where she also spoke to the current Bolt's avid fanbase and strong sales despite its advancing age. ""That's been something that has been really great this year, and that informed the decision that we'll have that back again in '25,"" Barra said, according to Automotive News. She did not provide any additional details about the future EV, though.
This tracks with a Reuters report from last month based on the automaker's tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union. A document from those negotiations indicated the UAW had secured a $391 million investment for a ""future electric vehicle"" at Fairfax Assembly in Kansas, which currently makes the Cadillac XT4 and Chevrolet Malibu. Sources told Reuters that the future EV that will be made in Kansas from 2025 is the next Chevy Bolt.
The launch timeline is also consistent with Mary Barra's remarks on GM's third-quarter earnings call in October. She said that giving the future Bolt a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery pack, and the fact it won't be a clean-sheet redesign, will contribute to ""getting to market at least two years faster."" LFP batteries are cheaper to build than their cobalt- and nickel-based variants, so while they store less energy, they are seen as a key technology for wider EV adoption; Tesla, Ford and other automakers are investing heavily into such batteries.
As a reminder, Barra said in October that the next-gen Chevy Bolt will leverage ""the best attributes of today's Bolt EUV, as well as Ultium, our latest software, and NACS."" This will also make the future Bolt GM's first deployment of LFP technology in the Ultium platform in North America. In doing so, GM will be saving ""billions in capital and engineering expense, delivering a significantly cost-improved battery pack using purchased LFP cells."" In addition, shifting to LFP will allow GM to have a ""substantially lower"" unit cost, Barra said.
While GM's  CEO did not provide range or price estimates for the LFP battery-powered Bolt, she said the vehicle ""will deliver an even better driving, charging, and ownership experience with a vehicle we know customers love.""
More stories on the future Chevrolet Bolt EV
GM has had an incredibly rocky path for its EV strategy this year. It has announced delays for several EV models—including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV RST, and GMC Sierra EV—as well as slower EV production and EV product spending cuts on its Q3 2023 earnings call.
The company also abandoned a goal to build 400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through mid-2024, although it reiterated its target to get to 1 million EVs of production by the end of 2025.
Last week, Barra admitted that GM has not executed well on its Ultium-based EV strategy this year as a manufacturing constraint has hampered battery module assembly, leading to a delayed start of electric pickup truck production at the Orion plant and the idling of the CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, until spring 2024.
Relaunching the Bolt may go a long way to fixing some of those problems. First launched in late 2016 and followed by the larger EUV variant in 2022, the Bolt has been a consistently popular seller in the U.S. despite not having the same fast-charging speeds as more modern EVs. But scores of buyers have been attracted to its low price tag, great range and compact utility. With any lucky, GM can pull a repeat with the next Bolt.",Dan Mihalascu
Here's Why The Tesla Cybertruck Might Never Make It To Europe (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/699164/tesla-cybertruck-might-never-make-it-to-europe/,"Weight, a penchant for smaller-sized vehicles, and the charging port all make for a tough pill to swallow.",12/5/2023 3:39,"Update: Lars Moravy, Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, confirmed for TopGear Netherlands that the Cybertruck will likely never make it to Europe.
""First of all, the market for pickups in America is huge, and that is different with you,"" Moravy  told TopGear. ""And two: European regulations require a rounding of 3.2 millimeters on protruding parts. Unfortunately, it is impossible to make a rounding of 3.2 millimeters on a 1.4 millimeter sheet of stainless steel,"" he added.
The original story follows below.
The first production-spec Tesla Cybertruck units were finally delivered last week after four years of delays, rumors, and all sorts of weird remarks from CEO Elon Musk on what seems to be his preferred way of communicating with the world, the social media platform X.
But while American customers who placed an order for the angular all-electric pickup can expect to get their hands on the EV sometime next year, European reservation holders shouldn’t get their hopes up.
The reason for this is the spec sheet itself, which–while impressive–might make Tesla’s first-ever pickup a sort of forbidden fruit on the Old Continent.
With up to 845 horsepower on tap and a zero to 60 miles per hour sprint in just 2.6 seconds, the Cybertruck is a quick truck, but it’s also a heavy one. Tipping the scales at 6,843 pounds for the top-of-the-line Cyberbeast model with three electric motors and a battery that has about 123 kilowatt-hours (according to Carwow), the Cybertruck is simply too heavy to be driven with a regular car license in Europe.
In this part of the world, people with a so-called category B license (for regular passenger cars) can drive a vehicle that has a maximum gross weight rating of 3.5 tonnes, which is 7,716 lbs. While the Cybertruck’s weight is under the limit, the 6,843 lbs number doesn’t take the 2,500 lbs payload into account. Add that up and you get 9,343 lbs or 4,237 kg. And that’s without taking into account the weight of the passengers.
According to the official VIN decoder that was submitted to regulators earlier this year, the Cybertruck has two possible gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR):
More Cybertruck Stories
As you can see, the lowest rating is already above the European limit. This would mean that–if it were to be sold in Europe–a Cybertruck customer would need to have a category C license which is meant for vehicles that have a GVWR of over 3.5 tonnes or 7,716 lbs.
In other words, a truck license. Speaking as a European myself, I know it costs more to get such a license compared to a regular B-type license and fewer people go to the trouble of getting one–why would they, if they don’t plan on driving a truck? So, not ideal for a vehicle that’s meant to be mass-produced and sold in high numbers.
Another factor that might make the Cybertruck an American-only affair is the limited appeal big pickups have had over the years in Europe. Smaller trucks like the Toyota Hilux, Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton), Volkswagen Amarok, and Ford Ranger rule the segment on the Old Continent, so a truck as big as Tesla’s would have a hard time making a name for itself in this part of the world.
""Pickup trucks are somewhat small in terms of market adoption in comparison to what you see in the U.S. market,"" said Pedro Pacheco, vice president of research at Gartner for Business Insider.
""For a vehicle in the category of the Cybertruck, there's not a huge market in Europe, because pickup trucks generally are not very common,"" he added.
Other Electric Pickups
And lastly, there’s the issue of the charging port. While Tesla’s so-called North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector is on the brink of becoming the de facto choice among EVs that are destined for the U.S. and Canadian markets, Europe has embraced the CCS2 plug. Even the European Tesla Superchargers come with a CCS2 connector.
So, to sell the Cybertruck in this neck of the woods, the Austin-based carmaker would have to somehow implement the CCS2 plug on the Cybertruck. That means hardware and software tweaks that Tesla might consider too big of a bother in the grand scheme of things.
Hard numbers are hard to come by because pickups are usually bundled with other light commercial vehicles like vans, but in 2020, just 116,280 pickups were sold in Europe, according to this Automotive News piece from two years ago.
That’s a far cry from the roughly three million pickups that were sold in the United States in 2020, making it an even less appealing market for Tesla, which wants to sell as many as 250,000 Cybertrucks per year by 2025.",Iulian Dnistran
GM CEO Expects ‘Significantly Higher’ EV Production In 2024,https://insideevs.com/news/698592/gm-significantly-higher-ev-production-2024/,Mary Barra said the company was “a bit disappointed” because of the manufacturing restraints in building EV battery cells.,11/30/2023 10:15,"General Motors is confident that its electric vehicle production will be “significantly higher” next year, CEO Mary Barra said yesterday. The news comes after several less-than-stellar (but growing) financial quarters where GM slowly increased production but remained well under 30,000 units per quarter since the beginning of the year.
“Frankly, we didn’t execute well this year as it relates to demonstrating our EV capability,” Barra said, quoted by Automotive News. “I am very confident with the EV portfolio that we have and the work that we’ve done to deliver significantly more Ultium-based products that customers, I think, will really appreciate.”
GM’s head honcho reiterated that it’s working to overcome a manufacturing constraint that has hampered the assembly of battery modules for its Ultium-based EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and GMC Sierra EV.
General Motors EV lineup
In a surprise move, the company announced that it will boost its dividend by 33% next year and repurchase $10 billion worth of shares, making it its biggest-ever buyback plan, according to Bloomberg. These, along with two other points on the company’s investor-focused agenda–reinstating the 2023 earnings guide and cutting spending on the Cruise robotaxi venture–resulted in a roughly 10% bump in the share price.
At the same time, however, the increased financial burden following the signing of a new labor contract with representatives of the United Auto Workers union–which will cost GM $9.3 billion through 2028–made some analysts uneasy about the automaker’s ability to pull through.
Barra responded by saying that GM will offset the increased labor costs “completely” by sticking to its four-pillar strategy.
“Our strategy is clear,” Mary Barra said during an interview with Bloomberg. “It’s really based on four pillars of executing our strong internal-combustion engine program vehicles, we’re performing very well on the market and we see that we’re below the average incentives. I think that speaks to the strength of our internal combustion engine products,” Barra added.
“From an EV perspective, we have confidence in the portfolio we have. We’re a bit disappointed this year that we were constrained by the automation to build [battery] modules, so this is not something that is fundamentally an issue with Ultium, it was more a manufacturing automation issue that we’re working on and we’ll be out of it by the middle of next year, and making improvements every quarter,” General Motors’ head said.
Software and autonomy are also part of the company’s strategy to turn things around. The introduction of more affordable EVs such as the Equinox and next-gen Ultium-based Bolt is also expected to drive adoption.
GM “never saw EV adoption as a straight line,” Barra explained, adding that while the growth rate has decreased, it’s still growing.

Hyundai Motor Will Halt One Of Its ICE Vehicle Factories To Build A New EV Plant,https://insideevs.com/news/698472/hyundai-motor-stops-ice-factory-to-build-ev-plant-korea/,Other manufacturers claim their EV sales are slow due to weak demand. So how come Hyundai is charging ahead?,11/29/2023 13:08,"Hyundai Motor, the company that owns and operates the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis car brands, will pause operations at one of its South Korean factories to focus its attention on building a brand-new electric vehicle plant.
According to Reuters, citing a regulatory filing, the East Asian automaker will halt its factory in Asan between December 31, 2023 and February 13, 2024. The Asan facility is described on the company’s website as being a “state-of-the-art self-sufficient factory” that manufactures passenger vehicles for export and operates an “environment-friendly solar farm on rooftops.”
Hyundai makes the Sonata and Grandeur combustion models here, but also the Ioniq 6 electric sedan.
The car group’s efforts will be directed toward the construction of a new EV-only plant at its main manufacturing complex in Ulsan, which is on the other side of the Korean peninsula. The Ulsan facility is the world’s largest single automobile plant, according to Hyundai Motor, comprising five independent plants that make cars like the Hyundai Kona, Santa Fe, and Tucson, as well as Genesis models like the GV80 and G90, among others.
The EV-only manufacturing facility will become the sixth plant at the Ulsan complex and–once it goes online in 2026–will be responsible for assembling the all-new Genesis GV90 flagship electric SUV.
As reported by The Korean Car Blog earlier this month, the GV90 will be the group’s first model based on the new Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) that’s designed to simplify the assembly processes and lower costs.
But when everything is said and done, how come the Korean auto group is marching ahead with its EV plans, while other names like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen are citing weak demand for battery-powered cars and slowing down their momentum?
Ford said that its Michigan battery plant will be smaller than initially planned, with an annual output of 20 gigawatt-hours instead of the originally planned 35 GWh. Additionally, construction at one of the two EV battery plants in Kentucky has been delayed.
On the same pessimistic note, GM delayed the market launch of the Equinox EV crossover, as well as the production of some Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV models until late 2025. Volkswagen slowed production at one of its European EV factories more than once because of less-than-stellar sales results and its CEO recently went on record saying that the people’s car brand has to tie up a lot of loose ends because it’s no longer competitive.
Hyundai Motor, on the other hand, outpaced all of its competitors except Tesla in terms of EV sales in the United States in the third quarter with over 28,000 battery-powered cars reaching customers. By comparison, Ford sold a smidge under 21,000 EVs while the Volkswagen Group and General Motors sold about 20,000 each.
Hyundai Motor Group was also ahead of all the other legacy automakers in the first three quarters of the year with approximately 62,000 EVs sold in the US, ahead of GM with 56,000 and the Volkswagen Group with almost 50,000 units.
In other words, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the Korean company is keeping its steady pace of expansion in the EV space. If sales are good, it makes sense to pour more money into the business so that they can sell even more later.
Hyundai has pledged to invest about $5.5 billion in a new EV factory in the state of Georgia, plus an additional $3 billion for research and development. That said, the Ulsan EV plant will gobble another $1.58 billion, bringing the total investment to roughly $10 billion in just a few short years.

Volkswagen Boss Warns 'We Are No Longer Competitive',https://insideevs.com/news/698154/volkswagen-boss-warns-no-longer-competitive/,"The company plans massive cost-cutting, including staff reductions.",11/28/2023 13:17,"Volkswagen Group—Europe's largest automotive group—has encountered some serious challenges as its main brand needs to cut costs on a massive scale.
According to Reuters, Volkswagen Brand CEO Thomas Schaefer warned the staff during a meeting at the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg that costs are too high, while productivity is too low, which together makes the cars uncompetitive: ""With many of our pre-existing structures, processes and high costs, we are no longer competitive as the Volkswagen brand.""
The German manufacturer is now working on a $10.9 billion (€10 billion) savings program, which will include staff reductions, the report says.
The amount of cost cuts is quite significant—equivalent to at least two large factories. It's not clear yet how the company will achieve its goal but details will be defined by the end of this year.
Gunnar Kilian, Volkswagen human resources board member said: ""We need to finally be brave and honest enough to throw things overboard that are being duplicated within the company or are simply ballast we don't need for good results.""
It seems that the situation is serious. As far as electric cars are concerned, Volkswagen was recently forced to slow down production at some of its plants in Europe. In some cases, the slowdowns were due to parts supply issues, and in others, because of insufficient demand.
Assuming that the company mages to reduce its costs and improve productivity, buyers should see lower prices.

France: 125 Million Euros Towards Development Of Cycling Infrastructure,https://insideevs.com/news/698005/france-125-million-funding-cycling-infrastructure/,France is once again rolling out funding for cycling-focused infrastructure projects.,11/28/2023 8:39,"Active mobility, particularly cycling, has seen monumental growth all over the world in recent years. Europe, in particular, is experiencing a surge in bike use – with electric bicycles specifically enjoying steady growth. In fact, in Germany, e-bikes are expected to surpass regular bikes in terms of sales figures in 2023.
That being said, as more and more people embrace biking as a means of mobility, Governments are working towards improving cycling-focused infrastructure. While this is something a lot of people would certainly love to see in the US, it seems that there’s still a long way to go until we begin to see bicycles integrated into the mainstream mobility scene. Perhaps we can take a few hints from our friends over in Europe, particularly in France.
Back in May, 2023, it was announced that France was to invest two billion euros towards the development of cycling infrastructure throughout the country. This time around, the French government has announced yet another call for cycling development projects, with the latest one being the seventh call for projects. The program is part of the country’s 2023 to 2027 cycling and walking plan, and will see the injection of a 125 million-euro budget. Come April, 2024, this budget is expected to double, opening doors to even more projects.
The project is headed by Christophe Béchu, the Minister of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion, and Clément Beaune, the Minister Delegate for Transport. Through this project, it’s hoped that France’s network of cycling routes would expand even further. Quite frankly, France is one of the most bullish when it comes to pushing for cycling-focused initiatives, so it’s certainly interesting to see how far they can push this. More specifically, the project involves the construction not just of new cycle paths, but also of greenways and dedicated bridges to accommodate cyclists.
More Fun On Two Wheels:
While the call for cycling-focused projects is open to the entirety of France, the program emphasizes an inclusive approach by focusing on regions with a lower population density, so as to ensure that these communities are not left behind when it comes to the development of mobility infrastructure. At present, the government has instituted a window from November 22, 2023, to March 8, 2024, for communities and regions to submit applications for projects. Following this, grants will be announced in July, 2024.

Here’s How BYD Rocked Toyota’s Manufacturing World,https://insideevs.com/news/696789/toyota-byd-ev-partnership-manufacturing-interview/,"Once a leader in manufacturing efficiency, Toyota learned a lot from Chinese automaker BYD.",11/17/2023 8:57,"Toyota has long been accused of being a latecomer in the electric vehicle game. But this year, the Japanese automaker that made a name for itself for its manufacturing prowess, announced some ambitious plans to step up its EV efforts.
These include giga casting techniques, a next-gen assembly line that makes use of autonomous cars that drive themselves down the line, and advancements in battery technology that should result in driving ranges of around 900 miles after 2028. 10 EVs based on an all-new architecture will also debut starting in 2026.
But all of this might have never been possible without a massive wake-up call from Chinese car maker BYD, which was Toyota’s partner in the development of the all-electric bZ3 sedan.
According to a Toyota Times interview with the Japanese company’s newly established BEV Factory’s president, Takero Kato, he was shocked during a business trip to China.
“For the first time, I came face to face with the competitiveness of Chinese components,” Kato said. “In China, they were not simply learning and applying technologies, but also rapidly transforming manufacturing.”
“Laying eyes on equipment that I had never seen in Japan and their state-of-the-art manufacturing, I was struck by a sense of crisis – ’We’re in trouble!’ At the same time, I began to think that I would like to spend the rest of my career in China,” he added.
This sense of realization came when Toyota started collaborating with BYD for the Chinese-market bZ3 sedan, which is based on the Japanese manufacturer’s e-TNGA platform but uses the Chinese maker’s Blade batteries.
As Kato says, the development of the electric sedan was marked by constant change. A particularly eye-opening experience came five months after the vehicle’s height and wheelbase were modified, which is a huge change in and of itself.
“The overall height was lowered by around 25 millimeters [0.9 inches], so the underbody had to be entirely redone. In Japan, that would have brought the entire development to a standstill,” Toyota’s BEV Factory chief said. “Regardless, everyone agreed on the change because we were committed to putting out a product that would make customers happy. Deep down, it seemed like a complete write-off, but we had to go for it,” he added.
While testing the bZ3 in Mongolia, Kato was summoned for an interview with Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s Chairman, and Koji Sato, the company’s CEO. During the meeting, he was asked to return to Japan and take the helm of the Vehicle Development Center, which handles everything from planning to mass-production development.
Fast-forward to July 2023, and Toyota is holding its annual General Shareholders’ Meeting in Tokyo. Here, Kato takes the microphone and says: “I love BEVs.” But was this scripted?
In this latest interview with Toyota Times, he explains that he truly believes what he said four months ago. “That was not lip service — I meant every word. Electric vehicles have unique qualities and driving performance only found in EVs.”

GM Quietly Gets Into The Gigacasting Game After Buying Key Tesla Supplier,https://insideevs.com/news/696594/gm-buys-tesla-gigacasting-partner-tei/,The move should help General Motors lower the cost of its upcoming EVs.,11/16/2023 13:04,"General Motors acquired one of the most well-regarded sand-casting specialists in the world – and one of Tesla’s rapid prototyping partners – earlier this year, quietly entering the gigacasting game, as shown in a Reuters report published by Automotive News.
Tooling & Equipment International, or TEI, has worked with Tesla to develop gigacasting mold prototyping for the Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck, and Semi, all while dramatically cutting development time and costs during the process.
By using casts made out of industrial sand with 3D printing, TEI, along with three other suppliers, helped Tesla halve the time it takes to develop a car from the ground up, going from three to four years to 24 months at most.
GM And EVs
But not anymore. Since July 2023, TEI has become part of GM’s Global Manufacturing division which oversees all of GM’s automobile and parts manufacturing operations, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
""General Motors acquired Tooling & Equipment International (TEI) to bolster its portfolio of innovations and secure access to unique casting technology,"" GM said in a statement.
The American car manufacturer first came in contact with TEI’s know-how when it approached the supplier to test and produce some underbody castings for the upcoming $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq, a source told Reuters. As luck would have it, TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for those Celestiq castings.
General Motors isn’t the only so-called legacy automaker to go down the gigacasting path that Tesla carved. Earlier this year, Toyota announced that it too will employ the technique for its next-gen electric vehicles which are expected to hit the road in 2026. Volvo, Ford, and Hyundai are also going down this route.
Gigacasting essentially means that a car has fewer but bigger metal components, which reduces complexity and manufacturing costs. Where a current vehicle might have a front subframe assembly made out of dozens of individual parts, a next-gen vehicle might have a single-piece subframe thanks to gigacasting.
Mind you, TEI was not responsible for the massive die-casting machines that Tesla is using in its factories. Instead, it – and others like it – makes test molds out of industrial sand using digital design files and 3D printers known as binder jets. These build a sand mold that can then cast molten alloys.
Compared to legacy casting techniques, this prototyping method enables a sand mold to be modified and reprinted quickly if adjustments are needed, with minimal cost.

"Pricing Is Still The Biggest Barrier For EV Buyers, Study Reveals",https://insideevs.com/news/696412/pricing-biggest-barrier-ev-adoption-survey/,That’s despite the fact that prices have dropped significantly.,11/15/2023 11:38,"The high purchase price of an electric vehicle is the biggest barrier for potential buyers on a global scale, a recent study from S&P Global Mobility shows. Almost half of all respondents to the survey listed affordability as the main concern when considering a new EV, followed by worries about charging and range anxiety.
Although the average price of new EVs has gone down dramatically in the last year, out of the almost 7,500 people surveyed, 48 percent said EV prices are too high, even though they understand that most EVs inherently carry a price premium. The study’s authors say that one of the reasons for this result is that price fatigue has set in, driven by rising interest rates and inventory shortages that have only recently seen relief.
Changes in the federal tax credit program in the United States now force customers to lease instead of purchase many models, which means more money needs to be spent out of pocket.
Furthermore, even though range anxiety and charging concerns have been relegated to the bottom end of the podium when it comes to EV adoption worries, the openness to purchasing an electric vehicle has gone down in recent years.
This year, S&P Global Mobility’s survey revealed that 67 percent of respondents were open to the idea of getting an EV. In 2022, the percentage was at 71 percent, and in 2021 it was at 86 percent.
On the charging front, about 46 percent of respondents were concerned about the time it takes to charge an EV, while 44 percent were concerned about the availability of charging stations. According to the study’s results, most of the respondents said they were willing to wait between 30 minutes and an hour to recharge.

""Consumers know (charging) will not be the standard gas station in-and-out experience,"" said Yanina Mills, senior technical research analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""But they don't want to delay for much more time than what would be a lunch break.""
When it comes to home charging, there’s a slight disconnect between the number of people who think this is the best and most common way to recharge an EV and the number of people who actually charge at home.
Respondents confirmed that home charging at night is considered best practice, but only 51 percent of current and repeat EV owners have a charger installed at home, while 42 percent of owners typically charge their cars this way.
Lucid Air charging at home charger
So, where do people charge their EVs if not at home? The survey revealed that a variety of places are frequented by owners, including streets, highways, and during work. As for those who do charge at home, they aren’t in a hurry, with 31 percent of responders not willing to pay extra to upgrade to a faster Level 2 charger from the included Level 1 charger that comes with the car.
When it comes to range anxiety, most respondents said they would accept a minimum EV range below 300 miles, while only 29 percent would prefer a minimum range above 300 miles.
Almost every new EV on sale today meets these requirements, so, logically, range anxiety is no longer the biggest issue for prospective buyers.
S&P Global Mobility surveyed 7,449 respondents from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, India, Thailand, Japan, and mainland China on May 23.

The U.S. Is ‘10 To 20 Years Behind Asia’ In Battery Manufacturing And Research: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/695605/us-behind-asia-battery-production-tech-senators-report/,A letter signed by two U.S. senators urges the Energy Department to step up America’s battery research game.,11/10/2023 11:17,"The United States is lagging behind Asia when it comes to battery research, manufacturing, and procurement of raw materials, according to a letter signed by two influential Democratic U.S. senators that was seen by Reuters.
The letter, which was written by Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner and Energy Committee Chair Joe Manchin, cites experts who say that the U.S. is “ten to twenty years behind Asia in commercialization of battery technology.”
The heart of the problem lies in China’s grip on the world’s battery cell production and America’s inability to rise to the challenge. As the letter notes, China makes more than 75 percent of the battery cells at a global level, while the United States managed to produce less than 10 percent of the world’s lithium-ion batteries last year.
Moreover, China dominates the globe’s battery supply chain, including graphite, which is required for almost all lithium-ion cells. This is particularly worrying, as China decided to restrict exports of graphite last month, making it harder to manufacture the anodes of the cells.
Demand is expected to grow seven times by 2035, so the U.S. has to do something about this situation. As a result, the letter states that a committee briefing has to take place by Dec. 1 “on ongoing research and development of next-generation battery technologies.”
A previous unreported letter seen by Reuters underlines the importance of the U.S. becoming a leader in manufacturing batteries and battery components, as well as securing supply chains for the materials that make up those components.
U.S.-Made Batteries
National security is also a part of the discussion, as the Pentagon has said in the past that lithium-ion batteries are crucial to thousands of military systems, including handheld ratios, unmanned submersibles, and future capabilities like lasers, directed energy weapons and hybrid electric tactical vehicles, according to the latest letter signed by the two senators.
Currently, China controls between 60 and 100 percent of the mining or refining capacity for five critical materials used for making most types of lithium-ion batteries, the letter said, adding that “it is critical that the U.S. lead in next-generation battery technology and alternate chemistries.”
The two senators’ latest letter comes after the European Union opened a formal probe into the subsidies received by Chinese electric car manufacturers that are trying to flood the market with cheap EVs. The probe was blasted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce as being “protectionist.”
In the United States, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to a 25 percent tariff that comes on top of the regular 2.5 percent import tariff for imported cars.

2023 LA Auto Show: Here Are All The New Vehicle Debuts,https://www.motor1.com/news/695331/2023-la-auto-show-debuts/,"Several automakers will unveil new or restyled models at the show, which opens to the public on November 17.",12/25/2024 7:32,"Update: Added Toyota Camry to the list and updated the Mustang GT California Special.
Friends, can you believe 2023 is nearly over? Here we are, talking about vehicles slated to debut at this year's LA Auto Show. It opens to the public on Friday, November 17, but doors for the media open a day earlier.
There are some notable debuts taking place this year, but we aren't expecting a flurry of activity as we did a few weeks ago at the Japan Mobility Show. And lest we forget, Stellantis backed out of the action due to the UAW strike. As a result, the new 2025 Ram and electric range-extended Ramcharger – that probably would've debuted at the show – already had their moments in the spotlight.
As of now, that leaves us with four proper debuts from major brands featuring either completely new vehicles, or updates of existing models. Here's a quick rundown of what to expect from the major brands, and check back often. Sometimes an automaker or two will surprise us leading up to the show; we will update this list as more automakers announce their debuts.
This is very likely a next-generation Subaru Forester, though we haven't heard anything official on that. Our email inbox received the above teaser photo from Subaru on November 2, promising something all new and fully redesigned. The key word here is redesigned, as it points to a thorough makeover of an existing Subie. Currently in its fifth generation, the Forester is the oldest model in Subaru's stable having been launched in 2018. The timing is appropriate for a sixth-gen version to arrive.
It's been over three years since Lucid announced its second production vehicle – the Gravity SUV. Much has happened in the world since then, but to Lucid's credit, development has continued, and we're finally ready to see the production version up close. It will be offered in a choice of two-row or three-row seating configurations, and since we're talking about Lucid, a crazy-powerful performance trim on par with the Tesla Model X Plaid is all but guaranteed.
The Crown is still a fresh nameplate in North America, having debuted in July 2022 as a high-riding sedan with serious crossover vibes. In Japan, however, Crown badges adorn several models including a spiffy SUV called Estate. It's coming to America, though Toyota has been cagey regarding the name. Whether it's called Crown Estate or something else, expect a bit more ride height and cargo space compared to the sedan. Under the skin, it will likely carry the same all-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain with up to 340 horsepower offered in Hybrid Max spec.
Sedans aren't dead by a long shot, and Toyota is committed to the segment with the next-generation Camry. Teaser images suggest it will borrow some styling cues from the Prius, but the big news is what's happening beneath the skin. HEV AWD badges suggest it could get the same powertrain as the aforementioned Crown, possibly delivering up to 340 hp. The current-generation sedan entered production in 2017, and its popularity hasn't waned over the years. In 2022 it was the fifth best-selling vehicle in the US, beating notable models like the GMC Sierra and Honda CR-V.
While not a new model per se, the GT California Special marks the first mainstream special-edition Mustang since the seventh generation's launch in 2022. The new pony debuted on November 9, contrary to the clever 11/11/23 clue hidden in a teaser image. It turns out that's the date the GT/CS makes its public debut, appearing at the South OC Cars and Coffee event at the Outlets of San Clemente, south of LA. It will still be at the show, bringing its special grille, blue accents, and other California Special appearance tweaks to attendees for the weeklong event.

Bigger E-Bike Subsidies And Tax Credits On The Horizon,https://insideevs.com/news/694799/ebike-discounts-subsidies-incoming/,"With governments looking to make e-bike ownership easier than ever before, now may be the best time to make the two-wheeled shift.",11/6/2023 14:52,"If I were to ask you your thoughts about e-bikes, chances are I’d get a bunch of mixed reactions. On the one hand, a lot of people are extremely optimistic about the future of mobility, and see electric bikes and other personal mobility devices as essential in paving the way forward. On the other hand, there are skeptics who question the very essence of e-bikes, labeling them as pointless, gimmicky, and more of a problem than the solution.
Nevertheless, the numbers don’t lie, and it’s foreseen that the e-bike business will balloon into a $120 billion industry by 2030. Indeed, when properly regulated, electric bikes have proven to be an effective replacement for cars when it comes to urban mobility, providing multifaceted benefits to its users, as well as society as a whole. As such, it’s no surprise that governments are taking big steps in promoting e-bike adoption within their localities. Indeed, we need not look far, as in the US, we can soon expect bigger financial incentives for people looking to get into the e-bike fold.
These incentives are government-funded projects which include rebates, tax credits, and discounts making electric bicycles more affordable and accessible for a wider audience. In an article by Electrek, it’s stated that Colorado offers one of the most significant e-bike incentive programs, providing up to $1,800 in subsidies. That’s quite a huge chunk of change, as some entry-level e-bikes are priced even lower than $1,800. Other states such as California are also reportedly developing their own incentive programs, although specific details have yet to be confirmed as of this writing.
The rapidly growing popularity of electric bicycles in the US is also putting a lot of pressure on cities to improve cycling infrastructure. If we fix our gaze over to Europe, we’ll have seen some massive cycling-focused initiatives in countries like Germany, Sweden, and The Netherlands, so much so that these projects seem to be outpacing mainstream transportation infrastructure developments. At the very least, we’re looking at massive integration projects that focus on safety, accessibility, and road-sharing among car drivers and VRUs (vulnerable road users).
In Case You Missed It:
It goes without saying that the US could benefit from widespread e-bike adoption, particularly in cities that have been experiencing worsening traffic conditions. E-bikes have also proven to be good for their users’ health and wellbeing, promoting an active lifestyle and exploring the great outdoors. These days, consumers are spoiled for choice with the vast selection of models available on the market. We recently talked about ultra affordable bikes such as the Lectric XPeak, a machine that serves as a solid springboard into the world of e-mobility. On the flipside, there are also tons of fancy e-bikes that blur the line between mobility and lifestyle.

Here’s How Stellantis Wants To Bring Cheap EVs To The Masses,https://insideevs.com/news/694123/stellantis-leapmotor-joint-venture-cheap-evs/,Spoiler alert: it involves a Chinese manufacturer.,10/31/2023 13:30,"Stellantis, the automotive behemoth that has no fewer than 16 brands in its portfolio, including Dodge, Fiat, and Jeep, wants to make cheap EVs more readily available with a bit of help from a new Chinese partner called Leapmotor.
After a $1.6 billion (1.5 billion Euro) investment, Stellantis will own a 20 percent equity stake in Leapmotor’s parent company, and the two will set up a joint venture that will – you guessed it – export the Chinese manufacturer’s battery-powered cars in other parts of the world.
The new JV, called Leapmotor International, will be incorporated in the Netherlands and the first market to get the affordable Chinese EVs will be Europe, with more scheduled to follow, according to Stellantis’ third-quarter financial results call.
In other words, the United States might finally get a low-cost but technologically advanced EV thanks to Stellantis’ latest venture, but until that happens, we’ll have to wait and see how Leapmotor’s cars will fare on the Old Continent, where there are already a few sub-$25,000 EVs to choose from.
In fact, Citroen, which is part of Stellantis, recently revealed the new European-built e-C3, which starts at around $24,500 (23,300 Euro). There’s also the Chinese-made Dacia Spring from rival company Renault that goes from $24,000 (22,750 Euro) on the list of no-frills EVs, so it will be interesting to see how the automotive group will price the cars it will be importing to Europe.
The cheapest model made by Leapmotor, the pint-sized T03 that measures just 142.5 inches long, starts at about $10,900 (RMB 79,500) in China, before tariffs and country-specific value-added tax (VAT), so there is some wiggle room, at least at first sight.
But Leapmotor also makes the more expensive C01 sedan and C11 SUV, along with their extended-range (EREV) versions, so the jury is still out on how Stellantis will market these Chinese cars on the Old Continent, especially considering how Leapmotor has focused on the mid- to the high-end market in its home country, according to Stellantis’ own press release.
The first batch of exported EVs will reach European shores next year, with the newly formed joint venture targeting 500,000 sales outside of China by 2030, plus an additional one million cars per year in China in the long term.
Stellantis CFO Natalie Knight said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the new brand is aimed at consumers “who are cost conscious but want the best technology in their products,” referring to Leapmotor vehicles’ ability to receive over-the-air (OTA) updates, as well as their proprietary “Four-Leaf Clover” Leap 3.0 centrally-controlled electric and electronic architecture.
With all this in mind, do you think a cheap, Chinese-made EV sold by Stellantis will ever make it to the United States? Let us know in the comments below.

Toyota FT-Se Electric Sports Car Has Dual Motors And All-Wheel Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/693790/toyota-ft-se-specs-performance/,The chief engineer says it will rival the electric Porsche Cayman and estimates it'll hit 60 mph in three seconds.,12/25/2024 7:32,"When Toyota unveiled the FT-Se at the Japan Mobility Show, all we got were some photos of a sweet little sports car with two seats and no combustion engine. Hideaki Iida, the project manager for the Gazoo Racing Design Group and the man who penned the concept, told our sister site InsideEVs that a production version could arrive after 2026. Other sources within the company alluded to our colleagues that it could have a simulated manual gearbox.
Now, more pieces of the puzzle are falling into place thanks to Top Gear magazine. The FT-Se has dual motors with one driving the front axle and the other the rear wheels for an AWD setup with a rear-biased behavior. These motors draw their juice from a ""special"" third-generation battery pack, for which cooling is going to pose a challenge during a planned Nürburgring hot lap.
The Green Hell is one of the longest racing tracks in the world as the Nordschleife layout is 12.94 miles (20.83 kilometers) long. The layout used for the 24-hour endurance race is even longer, at 15.7 miles (25.3 kilometers). The FT-Se's chief engineer Fumihiko Hazama told TG the company already has a target lap time in mind that he doesn't want to divulge for now.
""Cooling the battery around the Nürburgring will be very difficult. It's hard driving around a long course which makes the battery temperature higher. Cooling will be important for this car’s performance. For its speed.""
He estimated it'll do 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in three seconds, so a 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) sprint could drop below the three-second mark. Flat out, it's projected to reach 155 mph (250 km/h). Although the car's weight remains a mystery, Hazama gives us hope it won't be a porker. Mounted low in the center of the car, the new battery pack is said to be lighter than what's currently in use.
The body will use a combination of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), aluminum, and steel. Ideally, the goal is to make the FT-Se ""light and stiff at the same time"" while integrating some clever aero trickery, including a big diffuser for extra downforce.
As to the model's positioning in the range, Hideaki Iida told InsideEVs the sports car is not linked to an MR2 revival or an electric Supra.

"Hyundai Motor Sees Record Profit In Q3, Keeps Its EV Plans On Track",https://insideevs.com/news/693556/hyundai-record-q3-profit-ev-plans-on-track/,The news comes after Ford and General Motors delayed or abandoned some of their electric vehicle production goals.,10/27/2023 8:19,"Hyundai Motor, which includes the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis car brands, posted its third-quarter financial results today, and it’s good news for the Korean automaker.
The car manufacturer posted a record Q3 operating profit of $2.8 billion (KRW 3.82 trillion), up a whopping 146 percent from last year’s third quarter, while net profits more than doubled to $2.4 billion (KRW 3.3 trillion). At the same time, the operating profit margin reached 9.3 percent, more than double the 4.1 percent recorded in the previous year.
Mind you, these results are for the company as a whole, including the internal combustion-engined side of things, but electric cars were credited by Hyundai as being one of the reasons behind its expansion, along with higher sales for SUVs and Genesis models. In total, the Korean car group sold almost 169,000 electrified vehicles, including hybrid and all-electric, which is a 33 percent increase from last year.
With such a good previous quarter, Hyundai Motor is chugging away with its expansion plans that will see the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands offer as many as 31 EVs by 2030. Sales are expected to further increase in the coming quarters, including for battery-powered cars, and the company doesn’t see major production cuts as it moves forward.
By comparison, Ford and General Motors, which are considered two of the biggest players in the automotive industry, announced that they’ll delay or abandon some of their EV production goals citing a slowdown in EV adoption, slowing sales growth, rising labor costs, and a bleak economic outlook.
Ford’s Model E business unit, which is responsible for EVs, pushed back the goal of producing 600,000 battery-powered vehicles to next year, while General Motors abandoned its 400,000-unit EV production run rate from 2022 through mid-2024.
“We do not plan to dramatically reduce EV production or our line-up due to likely near-term hurdles as we believe EV sales will grow longer term,” Seo Gang Hyun, Hyundai Motor’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, told analysts at the company’s earnings briefing, according to Reuters.
By the end of the decade, the Korean automaker aims to increase its yearly EV output to 1.51 million in its home country, while on the global stage, Hyundai wants to see 3.64 million battery-powered vehicles roll off its production lines during the same time frame.
In the long term, it wants to become one of the world’s top three electric car producers. To make this happen, Hyundai Motor Group will spend some $18.2 billion (KRW 24 trillion) until 2030 to ramp up production and bring new models such as the Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Kia EV9 to the market.

"Used Electric Vehicle Prices Plummet, Sales Overtake Most New Models",https://insideevs.com/news/692585/used-ev-prices-lowest-since-2021/,"The used EV market has matured, and it has now surpassed new sales for all models except the Tesla Model Y.",10/22/2023 9:35,"Despite production challenges and a charging network that often still leaves a lot to be desired, the used electric car market is booming. Used EV sales in the first half of 2023 surpassed the majority of new EV sales, according to the latest market report from battery health and data startup Recurrent.
The company reports that in the first half of 2023, 140,000 used EVs were sold in the U.S.; that's more than even the total number of new Tesla Model 3s that were sold in the same time period if you can believe it. For context, a total of 200,520 new Model Ys are believed to have been sold in the first half of 2023.
In terms of other new EVs sold in the first six months of 2023, we have the Chevrolet Bolt coming in next at 33,659 units, followed by the Rivian R1T at 16,452 units and the Volkswagen ID.4 at 16,448 units. In other words, Tesla is still dominating the used EV market as well as the new one in the U.S.
""Used EV sales, as a segment, now dwarf the sales of every new EV model besides Tesla Model Y and 3,"" Recurrent said in its latest analysis of the situation. Moreover, ""the used EV market is more affordable than any time in the past 2.5 years, while the mix of vehicles favors newer, longer-range models than ever before.""
All of this is good news for consumers looking to purchase used EVs, as their prices are at their lowest since the start of 2021 and availability appears to be increasing. The average price of a used EV is now $27,800 in the US, falling 32 percent year-over-year. And Tesla has likely influenced this trend. The average price of a used Tesla Model 3 has decreased by more than $9,000 since 2021.
Several factors have contributed to the growth of used EV sales. For starters, the used EV inventory has grown threefold over the past three years, increasing from 11,000 vehicles in April 2021 to over 33,000 today. The share of pure EVs in this inventory has grown from 55 percent in 2021 to 73 percent today. The rest are plug-in hybrids.
Thirty percent of used EVs also qualify for the $4,000 federal clean vehicle credit, and obtaining the credit is about to become easier. From Jan. 1, 2024, customers will be able to transfer EV credits to a car dealer, lowering the vehicle’s purchase price instead of waiting till they file their tax returns the following year.
If you’re worried most used EVs are clunky old cars with degraded batteries, that’s probably not the case. Nearly 30 percent of cars in this inventory are less than two years old, and 45 percent of used EVs are three years old or newer. Yes, EV batteries degrade over time, but some owners have reported how the degradation rate can be negligible, even after clocking over 100,000 miles.
Read  Here:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X early this year that Tesla batteries last between 300,000-500,000 miles or 1,500 charge cycles. Most Model 3 and Model Y variants get a warranty of eight years or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, provided that the battery capacity retention is over 70 percent – many owners have reported over 90 percent of battery capacity retention after 100,000 miles.
The developments indicate a positive outlook for the used EV market in the US as they seem on track to become more affordable and accessible to a broader segment of the population in the coming months and years.

The Electric Vehicle Class of 2019 Shows How Far We’ve Come,https://insideevs.com/news/692515/ev-class-of-2019-range-prices/,"If you think EV tech and adoption aren't moving fast enough, just look at where we are now vs. four years ago.",10/20/2023 15:25,"Given the way Tesla alone has dominated so many headlines in recent years, it almost feels like electric vehicles have been an integral part of the industry for a long time. The truth is that modern EVs are still largely in their infancy. But this technology is moving incredibly fast. Just look at what was available a mere four years ago compared to now.
I call it “The Class of ‘19.” Back then, only 16 battery-electric vehicles were available for purchase in the U.S. market. Three were Teslas and the other 13 were from various legacy brands, including the Nissan Leaf, Volkswagen e-Golf, Fiat 500e, plus a few that have even managed to stick around today, like the Chevrolet Bolt and Jaguar I-Pace. But most of them were far different from today's EVs. And this suggests a rate of change that, if anything, will accelerate through at least the end of this decade.
To put things in context, it should be mentioned that battery-electric vehicles are both an extremely young technology and one of the oldest technologies in the industry. As the budding auto industry transitioned from the 19th century into the 20th, the market had not decided whether internal combustion engines would win the battle over the electric vehicles that were so prominent as the industry began. Ironically, the electric-powered self-starter turned the tide in favor of internal combustion engines, a tide that has yet to ebb.
Despite General Motors' attempt to shake things up with the mid-1990s GM EV1, no battery-electric vehicle raised its head as a viable consumer product until nascent Tesla (née Tesla Motors) had the temerity to market the Tesla Roadster in 2008. Soon after, Nissan got into the fray with the Leaf hatchback.
The Leaf, rather than the Tesla Roadster, set the pattern for EV 1.0. Automakers took the cheapest cars they had, typically subcompact hatchbacks, and swapped out their engines for expensive battery-electric powertrains. Most were adapted from ICE platforms; even the Leaf, innovative as it was, had an architecture derived from one used on cars like the Nissan Cube.
Among the 1.0 crowd were the Ford Focus EV, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Kia Soul EV. For these EVs, carmakers adopted a ""commuter philosophy."" Take the most affordable battery and stuff it into the cheapest car to keep the price down. They're not going to go very far, so they've got to be cheap. They were appealing as a second or third car that saved you money at the pump.
But, of course, they weren't that cheap in the context of the overall market because ICE versions of those cars, which did not require expensive battery packs, were (and are) less expensive to manufacture. The e-Golf, for example, started at $32,790, over $10,000 above the base Golf that year. Range wasn’t amazing back then, either; the average driving distance of the non-Tesla cars we looked at back then was about 165 miles, with a high of 258 miles with the Kona EV down to 84 miles with the 500e.
The EV Class of ’19 was filled with vehicles like that. So, four years later, how has EV 1.0 worked out? By the numbers, not all that well. Of those 13 non-Tesla EVs in the market in 2019, only a handful of models remain in the market today. Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona EV have entered a new and improved generation, but the exact futures of the Leaf, Bolt and I-Pace seem unclear. On the other hand, all three Tesla models available in 2019 are still on the market today. (More on those in a bit.)
So how were the Teslas able to survive when the first EVs from established manufacturers have largely vanished?
Tesla turned the industry on its ear with the Roadster, but even more with the 2012 debut of the Tesla Model S. The latter introduction was the beginning of EV 2.0. Instead of creating electric vehicles to comply with regulations, Tesla postulated an electric vehicle could be a tech product that is fast, sexy and fun – a completely different mindset. It's a top-down approach, playing up to the strongest attributes of EVs rather than making an attempt to hide them.
The approach continues to work well for Tesla, accounting for the continued success of its three models among the EV Class of ’19. It also spawned EV 2.0 competitors, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the GMC Hummer EV SUT. Following in the footsteps of upstart Tesla, established automakers chose some of their best-recognized names for their EV 2.0 round of vehicles.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E conjures smoking tires, burnouts, and high performance. It’s an SUV, because that is the most popular vehicle type, but it has the Mustang name and all the brand attributes associated with it. Among those qualities are fun, speed and tech—very different than EV 1.0.
While this might seem very familiar, as recently as the start of the pandemic, none of this was true. In 2019, the electric vehicle segment consisted of cheap EVs and Teslas.
Aging vehicles like the Tesla Model S, Model X and Model 3 – three Class of '19 survivors – have withstood the onslaught of newer EVs not only because of their intrinsic attributes but also because Tesla's management was prescient enough to understand that marketing EVs required more than simply good products. It also required building a charging infrastructure, the famed Tesla Supercharger network, to support those vehicles.
The reliability and ubiquity of the Tesla Superchargers has been so consistently strong that when considering an EV, many consumers only think of Tesla. The charging network enables Tesla owners to drive across the country without concerns about charging. At the same time, the rest of the automakers rely on a third-party system to create the infrastructure charging network which has not worked out very well for most consumers. In fact, the vast majority of manufacturers have now announced plans to adopt Tesla’s charging standard and protocol, the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, to address this competitive gap.
Another Tesla innovation is continual vehicle updates, the majority delivered over the air. Tesla can and does make significant changes to vehicles already in customers' hands. Some changes are frivolous, but others are substantive. Tesla customers have the sense that when they buy the vehicle, it has the potential to get better and not worse over time, and that breeds a lot of excitement and energy.
Today, the EV landscape is quite different from 2019. There are now 44 non-Teslas in the Class of '23. Adding Tesla's four current models, the full Class of '23 stands at 48. And that number is rapidly expanding. The compact utility segment has the largest roster of entries, but diversification has begun in earnest. The Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV SUT are battery-electric pickups. The recently announced Volvo EX90 and soon-to-appear Kia EV9 are three-row battery-electric EVs. Exciting as that is, the diversification hasn't really scratched the surface yet.
It’s not just availability either. Electric range has drastically improved since then. A simple average for non-Tesla EVs on sale in the U.S. today is 250 miles. The shortest ranges are Mazda MX-30 at 100 and Mini Cooper SE at 114, while the Lucid Air is the king of the pack at 433. Tesla averages 318 miles of range today.
It won't be long until we see EV models in nearly every current vehicle segment. We've now crossed that line from the regulation-compliance cars of EV 1.0 to the performance-tech-driven vehicles of EV 2.0. In the next step in the evolution EVs will offer the price mentality of EV 1.0 while delivering some of the size, drivability, and amenities of EV 2.0. The industry will close the circle in EV 3.0. Those purpose-built EVs will include many models priced and equipped for the masses as the industry offers EVs for consumers in all walks of life.
Just imagine: Where will we be four years from now?

"Stellantis Pro One Business Unit Announced, Three Electrified Pickup Trucks Due By 2026",https://www.motor1.com/news/692157/stellantis-pro-one-business-unit/,One of them will have a hybrid powertrain.,12/25/2024 7:32,"Earlier this month, Stellantis announced plans to hold the ""Commercial Vehicles Ambition Day"" on October 23 to outline its plans pretraining to vans and trucks. In the lead-up to the event scheduled for next Monday, the automotive conglomerate is announcing Stellantis Pro One – the new name of its light commercial vehicle (LCV) business unit. It bundles no fewer than six brands: Citroën, Fiat, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall.
Come Monday, Stellantis Pro will unveil a new van lineup for all six brands. Considering the Fiat Ducato has been spied testing recently, as shown below, we might get to see the updated large van and its many rebadged versions: Ram ProMaster, Opel Movano, Vauxhall Movano, Peugeot Boxer, and Citroën Jumper. Speaking of the ProMaster, Stellantis says the EV version will be officially introduced later this year.
The newly founded business unit intends to launch four electrified pickups over the next two years. The Ram 1500 REV is one of them, along with a hydrogen-powered pickup. These future models are part of an updated lineup of vans and trucks in North America that will be gradually rolled out in the coming years. Stellantis Pro One is promising a greener lineup courtesy of a second-generation electric drivetrain with a longer range and the hydrogen fuel cell setup we mentioned earlier.
The LCV sector is of massive importance for Stellantis since it accounts for a third of its net revenues. It sold 1.6 million units last year, but LCV boss Jean-Philippe Imparato admits ""we have still to do some homework"" to beat Ford Pro. The head honcho went on to say the compact vans such as the Citroën Berlingo, Fiat Doblo, Peugeot Partner, Opel Combo, and Vauxhall Combo will all be renewed in 2024 when the midsize Opel Vivaro, Vauxhall Vivaro, Peugeot Expert, and the Fiat Scudo will be updated as well.

Federal Tax Incentives To More Than Double US EV Sales By 2030: Analysis,https://www.motor1.com/news/691949/ira-more-than-double-ev-sales-2030/,Demand for lithium should be 15 percent higher in the United States in 2035 thanks to the US Inflation Reduction Act.,12/25/2024 7:32,"The landscape of the American automotive industry has been evolving rapidly in recent months, and that's largely driven by the multifaceted impacts of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This legislation, signed into law in August 2022, has had a profound effect on various sectors, particularly electric vehicles and the lithium industry. According to a new analysis, impacts from the IRA will boost the outlook for electric vehicle sales in the country by 2030 to more than double the pre-IRA forecast.
In 2023, the US is forecasted to sell over 1.3 million combined battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids, which will mark a 52-percent increase over last year. S&P Global’s latest analysis predicts that by 2030, plug-in sales are projected to skyrocket to over 6 million annually. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of these vehicles will be fully electric, which are now expected to surpass 4.6 million by the end of the decade and that is more than double the initial forecast of around 2 million units. That would put extra stress on the grid infrastructure, though.
""Given the forecasted increase in EV sales, electricity load is expected to increase, reaching 83 TWh by 2030,"" Suzanna Massingue, low carbon transportation analyst with S&P Global, comments. ""In addition to the increase in forecasted vehicle sales, a larger proportion of these will be fully electric vehicles, generating a higher electricity demand. It is widely recognized that an upgrade of the power grid will be required to ensure the charging network can support the intended sales growth.""
The Impacts Of IRA So Far:
The US Inflation Reduction Act has played a pivotal role in boosting the adoption of electric vehicles. One of its most significant contributions is the system of production and consumer tax credits, which have stimulated the production of critical minerals and the supply of battery components within the US and its free-trade agreement partners. As a result, companies have allocated substantial funds to explore lithium deposits within the country, positioning the US as one of the leaders in the search for this essential component of lithium-ion batteries.
The IRA will not only fuel the EV adoption but also trigger a renaissance in the American lithium industry. One notable aspect of this revival is the growing interest in exploring lithium deposits in the United States. In 2022, companies allocated more funds to lithium exploration in the US than any other country, with the highest level of investment in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. As a result, post-IRA US energy transition demand for lithium is projected to be 15 percent higher by 2035 than it would have been in a pre-IRA scenario.
Data from Market Intelligence shows that the total lithium exploration budget in the US, which holds the second-largest lithium reserves and resources globally, reached $93.5 million in 2022, a significant increase from $48.4 million in 2021. These developments in the EV and lithium industries have had a noticeable impact on the market. Lithium prices, which reached all-time highs in late 2022, have since seen a significant decrease.
As a reminder, the US Inflation Reduction Act is a significant piece of legislation signed into law in August 2022 with the primary goal of addressing inflation and stimulating economic growth in the United States. This comprehensive act is designed to have far-reaching effects on the American economy, impacting various sectors and individuals across the nation.

European Declaration On Cycling To Stimulate Bicycle Industry In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/691774/european-declaration-cycling-unveiled/,The EU wants to accelerate the widespread use of bicycles for urban mobility.,10/18/2023 8:44,"In Europe, bicycles, both electric and muscle-powered, have gained quite a lot of popularity, especially when it comes to the urban mobility sector. A lot of cities across Europe have been adopting a more cycling-focused approach, encouraging their citizens to ditch their cars for quick trips around the city. Indeed, the benefits of cycling are tenfold, and the EU is taking cycling seriously. Very seriously.
The European Commissioner for Transport recently unveiled the European Declaration on Cycling, a program with both long and short term goals designed to unlock the full potential that cycling has to offer. The declaration lays the groundwork for future legislation around cycling, with a total of 36 principles aimed at advancing cycling in the European Union.
The European Union emphasizes the sustainable and accessible nature of cycling, highlighting the benefits making the shift to two wheels has not only to an individual’s health, but also to society and the economy. At present, nearly all European cities have bicycle-focused infrastructure that allows both bicycle and electric bicycles riders to enjoy a safe and efficient experience. The EU’s new declaration looks to boost this even further, and hopes to “enhance bicycle mobility” even more.
Among the key measures of the declaration include improving cycling infrastructure, and making bikes more easily integrated with other means of transportation such as buses and trains. In total, there are 36 principles in the European Declaration on Cycling (all of which can be viewed in the official document linked below), covering the bases from infrastructure development, increased investments in the cycling industry, bike-focused tourism, and improving data collection.
Speaking of the cycling industry, the European Commissioner for Transport, Adina Vălean, sees huge potential in the cycling industry, as it presents Europe with the opportunity of more high-quality jobs particularly in training and cycling tourism. “This Declaration recognizes cycling as one of the most sustainable, accessible and inclusive, least expensive and healthiest modes of transport and leisure, as well as its central importance for European society and the economy,” Vălean told French e-mobility publication Clean Rider.
At present, there are some pretty high hopes for the e-bike industry, as well as the cycling industry in general. In Germany, for example, e-bikes are expected to overtake regular bicycles in terms of sales volumes in 2023. On top of that, by 2030, the global e-bike industry is expected to surpass $120 billion.

Europe: E-Bikes Categorized As Bicycles Not Motor Vehicles,https://insideevs.com/news/691544/europe-ebikes-classified-bicycles-not-motor-vehicles/,The EU Court of Justice's recent ruling exempts e-bike riders from the stringent insurance requirements of motor vehicle users.,10/16/2023 8:55,"It's no secret that the micromobility industry has its fair share of haters. Quite a few of my articles covering debuts of new electric bicycles are met with comments classifying them as electric motorcycles as against to electric bicycles. While it's easy to see where these comments are coming from, it's important to note that there's a difference between e-bikes and electric motorcycles, and even e-mopeds. A big one.
A recent ruling by the EU Court of Justice was just released which officially classifies electric bicycles as bicycles, and not motor vehicles. Technically speaking, electric bicycles, at least in Europe, are not allowed to have throttle-only modes, and can only be motorized as the cyclist cranks at the pedals. This lies at the very core of the ruling: e-bikes are classified as bicycles because they require the rider to pedal. Meanwhile, motor vehicles must be propelled exclusively by their motor.
An article by Forbes highlights that the root of this debate lies in an e-bike accident in Bruges, Belgium, where an e-bike rider was killed in an accident with a car. The case was then referred to the EU Court of Justice who finally determined that the individual on the e-bike was entitled to compensation as a ""vulnerable road user"" instead of a regular motor vehicle. The latter stipulates much less compensation as the former.
The EU Court of Justice's ruling means that e-bike riders are exempted from motor vehicle insurance in Europe – something that's a prerequisite for car drivers and motorcycle riders. On top of that, the court ruled that e-bikes are ""incapable of causing damage comparable to motorcycles or cars."" Of course, this isn't to say that e-bikes are super safe means of mobility. In Europe, e-bikes are limited to nominal outputs of 250 watts, and aren't allowed to provide any assistance at speeds in excess of 25 kilometers per hour (15 miles an hour).
All that being said, e-bike rules and regulations in the US are much more relaxed. In fact, a wide selection of e-bikes sold in the US produce power upwards of 500 watts, and a lot of them come standard with a thumb throttle. In such cases, the EU Court of Justice's ruling seems to be inapplicable. At present, Class 1 and 2 e-bikes have a federally mandated top speed of 20 miles per hour on motor power alone, while Class 3 e-bikes have a limited top speed of 28 miles per hour.
At the end of the day, regardless of where in the world you're from, it's always best to err on the side of caution. E-bike insurance remains a good idea against theft and accident damage. On top of that, wearing protective gear, not least of which is a certified helmet, may not be required just yet, but there's nothing to lose when it comes to safety.

Commercial E-Cargo Bikes Picking Up Steam In Urban Setting,https://insideevs.com/news/691283/commerical-ebike-delivery-services-prove-efficient/,UK’s Man Maid claims that its cargo e-bikes are 10 times faster than delivery vans in the city.,10/13/2023 14:06,"Electric bicycles have proven their worth when it comes to getting from point A to B in the urban setting. That said, they’ve gone beyond simple personal mobility, and are now proving to be essential tools for business to deliver products and services. For the longest time, delivery businesses – be it for products or services – have relied on bulky vans that can easily get stuck in traffic.
The advent of electric bicycles, particularly those designed to haul heavy cargo, is vastly changing the last-mile delivery industry. Indeed, several times before, we’ve talked about a lot of companies making the shift to e-mobility. Brands like Zoomo and even Ikea are incorporating e-bikes into their fleet of delivery vehicles in order to better keep up with the demands of folks living in the urban setting.
In the UK, for instance, Man Maid, a handyman service that offers home-service plumbing, carpentry, electrical, and other home essentials, has been seeing quite a lot of success with the use of its fleet of electric cargo bikes. Man Maid’s founder, Mungo Morgan, explained to cycling publication E-Bike Tips that switching to electric bicycles has increased the company’s operating speed and efficiency by a significant margin. In fact, he states that e-bikes are “10 times quicker than a van” when it comes to providing services within the city. Here’s a video of one of the e-bike-riding service providers navigating through the busy city.
Yet another clear benefit of this is that the company reportedly saves up to £7,000, or about $8,500 USD, in parking tickets per year when compared to using traditional delivery vans. This makes perfect sense, as e-bikes are much smaller than even the smallest of vans, and can pretty much be parked anywhere – even the driveway (or walkway) of a small house or cottage. As for the speedy service, e-bikes get to skip the queues at stoplights and traffic, as a lot of the time, they get their own paths where cars and vans are not allowed to drive through.
At the end of the day, efficiency is key when it comes to the logistics industry, and it’s interesting to see companies big and small integrating electric bicycles into their fleets of delivery vehicles. Of course, big vans and trucks still have their place when it comes to transporting goods across long distances, but when it comes to the hectic maze that is the urban jungle, compact e-bikes reign supreme.

The Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Is So Much Car: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/745373/2024-porsche-cayenne-turbo-e-hybrid-coupe-review/,"Tons of power, tons of weight, tons of money.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Nothing inspires mixed emotions quite like a performance plug-in hybrid. At first, it seems like a perfect middle ground between gas and electric. There’s smooth, emissions-free driving for running around town, big range and quick refueling for long trips, and huge performance when you let the engine and motor work in tandem.
The new Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid does offer all that. But, it’s not quite as simple as having your cake and eating it too.
Porsche facelifted the third-generation Cayenne for the 2024 model year, and the changes are extensive. For the plug-in hybrid models, the battery capacity increases from 14.1 kilowatt-hours to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, which brings a big bump in electric range. The motor also gets an increase from 134 to 174 horsepower, and combined with a revised twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid produces a ripping 729 hp and 700 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than the old Turbo S E-Hybrid. More than any combustion SUV out there now, save the mechanically similar Lamborghini Urus SE.
But there is a price to pay for this blending of combustion and electricity—and not just the steep $158,995 base price of the 2025 model (our tester was a 2024). Porsche quotes a curb weight of 5,719 pounds for this Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe. The Cayenne GTS Coupe, which uses the same V-8 without the hybrid system, weighs nearly 700 pounds less.
The whole thing is a little absurd. Not just the weight figure on its own, I mean the whole thing. A luxury SUV that nods toward efficiency and the need to reduce our environmental impact but also has a twin-turbo V-8 and weighs as much as two original Boxsters. It’s just so much car.
The weight dominates everything. Admittedly, this Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid coupe handles its weight as well as it can, thanks to the optional rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll systems. It’s freakishly agile and body roll is kept to an absolute minimum when you put it into Sport Plus mode, where the car lowers on its air springs and stiffens up its adaptive dampers. Through corners, this Cayenne doesn’t feel its weight whatsoever.
Steering is precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, but surprisingly light. And below 50 miles per hour, when the rear wheels are calibrated to turn in the opposite direction of the fronts, there’s this slightly unnatural sense of the car castering around that takes a bit to get used to.
Porsche revised the springs and dampers for all facelifted Cayenne models, and here, they provide an uncanny-good spread of soft, cushion-y ride quality and sport-sedan-like handling. Even on the optional 22-inch wheels, big bumps barely make a blip. Basically, it rides and handles in a way that is entirely divorced from its huge weight and tall ride height.
Still, you’re always conscious of the weight under braking. Even slowing down at low speeds for a stop sign, you can feel all that mass shifting around beneath you. It never feels quite right. Also not helping matters is the fact that the braking is inconsistent. It’s always a challenge to blend regenerative braking from the motor and friction braking, especially when you have carbon-ceramic rotors, as our tester does.
Coming to a complete stop around town, you always end up getting a bit more braking than you want. The motor drives through the Cayenne’s eight-speed automatic, so when you’re coming to a stop, the car has to balance motor regeneration with downshifts. You don’t feel the shifts, but the sensation is similar to aggressive engine braking. Trying to be perfectly smooth rolling to an intersection is a real challenge.
Occasionally the hybrid system hiccups when getting up to speed too, but once you’re going, it’s all very smooth. The engine cuts in and out seamlessly, and the motor is always ready to deliver a wallop of torque.
It’s silly quick, unsurprisingly. The electric motor and engine combine to make the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid feel like it’s got a supercharged Chevy V-8 under the hood. You go to pass someone on the highway, and the eight-speed auto downshifts a gear, maybe two, before an endless surge of power. Get on it hard from a low gear, and it’s even more eye-opening. Performance like this was not long ago exclusive to upper-echelon 911s.
This might be heretical to say, but it sounds better than a lot of new 911s, too. As part of the Lightweight Sports Package—a laughable line item for a 5,700-pound car—you get a center-exit sports exhaust, and it’s raucous. Even in its quiet modes, there’s an ever-present burble from the V-8 and a muscle-car thunder with the valves fully open. It’s childish and totally addictive.
Still, the harder you get on it, the more fuel you’re going to burn. Which is, of course, obvious, and normally not a concern in a hi-po SUV. But in a little over a week with the car, I couldn’t stop thinking about fuel economy. I imagined a guilt-free yet powerful V-8 experience, and while the hybrid system can decrease fuel consumption, it doesn’t turn this Porsche into a Prius.
As with all plug-in hybrids, you have to charge it often. Updated Cayenne hybrids get an 11-kilowatt on-board AC charger, so if you have the right setup at home, you should be able to get a full battery in around two and a half hours. And the range is excellent. The EPA says it’ll do 24 miles on a charge, but I regularly saw figures closer to 40 miles.
If you’re driving around town slowly, you’ll get great fuel economy. Hell, you can leave the Cayenne in E-Power mode and the V-8 will never even turn on until you get on the throttle hard. Longer trips at higher speeds are a mixed bag, though. I drove the car 200 miles and back mostly on the highway, but with about 20 miles of slow New York City traffic. With a full battery, I managed nearly 27 mpg compared to 22 mpg with around a quarter of a battery. It’s not nothing! But, it’s still conspicuous consumption.
Ultimately, you’re left with something that's the best of both worlds, and the worst of both worlds. Under the right circumstances, you can get a big efficiency benefit from the hybrid system, but at other times, it’s a lot of extra weight to carry around.
Philosophically, the base Cayenne E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid probably make more sense, pairing a lighter, more efficient V-6 with the same battery and motor. But, the performance and speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick personality typical of a Porsche Turbo is undeniable. I like this thing a lot, even though I also find it totally ridiculous and suspect that it’s likely not quite as satisfying as a pure gas car, or a full EV.
And this being a review of a Porsche, we can’t end before talking about the price. It is so damned expensive. Notably, the base price between this 2024 test car and the equivalent 2025 model jumped from $153,050 to $163,945. The as-tested price of this one rises from $191,230 to just under $200,000. You can skip a lot of the options our tester has, like the $9,070 carbon-ceramic brakes and the $10,700 Lightweight Sport Package (though it is the only way to get these amazing houndstooth seats). Still, it’s a very expensive car no matter how you slice it.
I suppose it’s natural for a complicated car to engender complicated feelings. Some moments, you love it. Others, you’re baffled by it. And often, you’re left astonished by just how silly it is. I sort of want one, and I’m slightly disturbed by that notion.
Like I said earlier, mixed emotions.

Production Of Fiat And Maserati EVs Will Stay Paused Over Slow Sales,https://www.motor1.com/news/745181/stellantis-pauses-maserati-fiat-production-again/,"Stellantis is extending the Fiat 500e production stoppage until January 20, while Maserati EV production is paused until February 3.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Fiat won’t be building any new 500es anytime soon. Stellantis has extended the shutdown at the factory where it assembles the little electric vehicle until January 20. The automaker had announced late last month that it would pause production at its Mirafiori factory in Italy until January 5.
The new extended shutdown also includes the Maserati GranTurismo and GrabCabrio that Stellantis also builds at the plant. However, according to the Reuters report, the automaker won’t restart producing those two models until February 3.
Stellantis has paused production at the factory before, including twice late last year in September and again in October. Electric vehicles just aren't selling as well as automakers had planned, and automakers are now curtailing EV production while reconsidering their electrification efforts.
CEO Carlos Tavares had previously blamed bad marketing for Maserati’s woes, but Stellantis has since parted ways with the CEO. There was disagreement between Tavares and the board about the automaker’s direction, leading to his sudden resignation at the beginning of the month.
Interestingly, abysmal EV sales have been a boon for consumers looking for cheap leases. Falling demand is leaving dealers with a lot of inventory they’re eager to move. One dealer in Colorado is currently offering a $0-a-month lease on the new 500e, leaning generous federal and state incentives to give consumers excellent deals.

Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

Porsche Is Struggling With Electric 718 Boxster Development: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/744790/porsche-718-electric-development-problems/,Battery issues could delay the next Cayman as well.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Already discontinued in Europe because of cybersecurity regulations, the current-generation Porsche 718 is not long for this world. The gasoline-fueled Boxster and Cayman duo will be discontinued globally by next year. What comes after? An all-electric sports car. However, there's reportedly a possibility of a gap between when the ICE dies and when the EV indirectly takes its place in the lineup.
Automobilwoche, the German branch of Automotive News Europe, claims Porsche is having problems developing the 718 EV. The engineers from Zuffenhausen are apparently ""well behind schedule,"" so there's a real risk the electric sports car's launch could be delayed. The mid-mounted battery is believed to be the culprit, with Porsche ""constantly requesting adjustments"" from supplier Valmet Automotive.
The Finnish company is doing as asked, but it's incurring additional costs that Porsche allegedly doesn't want to pay or only partially covers. Based on our oldest spy shots, the electric 718 has been undergoing testing for at least two years. Nevertheless, it's increasingly likely that the Boxster and Cayman without a combustion engine will not be ready for primetime in 2025 to supersede the gas cars swiftly.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg. According to Automobilwoche, the next-gen, electric-only Cayenne could also be delayed from its original programmed debut in 2026. Porsche has already stopped chasing its lofty goal of having EVs account for 80% of annual sales by 2030. In addition, the German luxury brand has pledged to keep the V-8 engine well into the next decade.
The report mentions that the Panamera could get a next-generation model with combustion engines, given the company's current slowdown in electric sales. Taycan deliveries were down 50% globally through September. On a more positive note, the 911 is said to continue with gas engines into the 2030s. On numerous occasions, Porsche has said the 911 will be its final ICE car.
Elsewhere, the large electric SUV known internally as the ""K1"" could be pushed back by a few years. Alternatively, Porsche is reportedly considering extending the Cayenne's platform for a three-row SUV with gas engines since the Volkswagen Group Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) doesn't support conventional powertrains. Last month, the Chief Financial Officer, Lutz Meschke, admitted that future models that were supposed to be electric-only could get gas engines:
""We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""
Porsche is in a delicate situation. The next-gen Macan was supposed to be released about two years ago, but software glitches prevented the electric crossover from being released on time. It's now finally out. To make matters worse, the ICE version—which has always been among the firm's top sellers—will be phased out worldwide in 2026. It has already been axed in Europe due to the same cybersecurity regulations that killed the 718.
As if that wasn't bad enough, demand in China has collapsed this year, with deliveries falling by nearly 30% in the first nine months.
We've reached out for a comment from Porsche. The article will be updated if we hear back.

BMW Built An All-Electric M2 Prototype,https://www.motor1.com/news/744902/bmw-m2-ev-prototype/,A small team of engineers has been working on this car since 2018.,12/25/2024 8:49,"BMW's M division is going electric. Last week the company teased an all-electric version of its iconic M3, set to hit showrooms in 2027. Now, the company is showing off another all-electric M car: A prototype based on the first-generation M2 coupe.
The car, internally called The Beast, was conceived by a small group of engineers in 2018 on a ""mission to explore what's possible,"" according to Michael Sailer, one of the team's dynamics engineers.
The car looks fairly stock on the outside, save for a couple of tow hooks, a ducktail trunk spoiler, and a set of gold-painted brake calipers—likely carbon-ceramics. The cabin has been stripped to accommodate a roll cage, a racing seat, and a suite of testing equipment.
BMW did not go into detail on the M2 prototype's powertrain, but it's clear the factory turbocharged straight-six has been replaced by some kind of electric power. Seeing as how every electric M car will have four motors, this M2 may be rocking a quad-motor setup itself. But that's just speculation.
Engineers describe the battery-powered M2 prototype as hard to control. M boss Frank Van Meel compares it to the F10-generation M5, which sent power to the rear wheels only, making it a relative handful considering its twin-turbo V-8 power. It forced the team to turn to AWD for the next-generation car.
""I can still remember January 2015, Cobo Hall, Detroit Motor Show, where I said in an interview, the next M5 generation will need four-wheel drive,"" he said. ""And everyone was going 'this is the end of the universe,' because if you put four-wheel drive on an M car it will only go straight forward, there will be no dynamics left.""
Van Meel said he had to ""live with this shit-storm"" for three years until the first all-wheel drive M5 came out, then everyone drove it and loved it. He likens the transition to electric power to the transition from rear-wheel drive to all-wheel drive.
""Trust me, that what we're working on now for the future will be at least as great as what we did [with the first AWD M5],"" he said. ""Now we will make that beast controllable, so that the next step in high performance is on the horizon.""

"Tavares: China Is 'Many Years' Ahead With EVs, Says EU Politicians Created 'Dead End'",https://www.motor1.com/news/744740/tavares-resignation-amicable-blames-eu-politicians/,"The Ex-Stellantis CEO believes China is years ahead when it comes to EVs, hence his push for company goals many said were unrealistic.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares isn't backing down from the decisions that led to his resignation. In his first interview since voluntarily exiting the company, he effectively double-downed on his stance that conflicted with the Stellantis board members. At the same time, he voiced concerns that China was far ahead in the electric fold, essentially forcing European brands into survival mode.
Speaking with Portuguese news outlet Expresso, the ex-executive emphasized the importance of having a strong, singular vision and admitted his plan didn't mesh with the board.
""A company that has 250,000 employees and 15 brands cannot be managed with a lack of alignment,” said Tavares, according to Expresso. That was the catalyst for his resignation, which Tavares described as an ""amicable"" joint decision between him and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. And it seems he has no regrets, as Wards Auto reports he would make the same calls if it all came about again.
His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

It Begins: Honda And Nissan Reportedly Starting Merger Talks,https://www.motor1.com/news/744769/honda-nissan-merger-talks-rumor/,The two will allegedly operate under a new holding company.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Nissan and Honda are reportedly about to begin talks of merging. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, which cites no specific sources, the two will operate under a new holding company, with the specific details to be decided later. The new group will also allegedly look to include Mitsubishi in the future.
Nissan and Honda began working together in March 2024, expanding their partnership in August to include Mitsubishi as the three agreed to develop electric vehicles and software jointly. Nissan owns a 24 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
Neither Nissan nor Honda would confirm the report's allegations to Reuters, telling the publication that the two are ""exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths.""
And Nissan certainly needs the help.
This year has not been kind to the Japanese automaker, with the company cutting production of its best-selling vehicle while asking dealers to sell cars at a loss. Late last month, two unnamed executives told the Financial Times that the company only had 12 to 14 months to survive. Nissan recently tapped former Jeep CEO Christian Meunier to serve as chairman of Nissan America.
The automotive industry is facing unprecedented challenges. There's more competition, more change, and less certainty than ever before. Chinese automakers are edging out Western brands in their home market, with some beginning to see real sales gains in Europe and elsewhere. Electrification is another considerable point of disruption, where the industry is chasing Chinese progress, forcing traditional automakers to get creative to stay competitive.

Lamborghini Is Delaying Its First EV Like Everyone Else,https://www.motor1.com/news/744579/lamborghini-delays-first-ev-2029/,The production-ready Lanzador will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Several automakers within the last year have altered their electrification plans. Slowing growth is forcing companies like Volvo, Bentley, Ford, and others to reconsider their strategies and rejigger their launch schedules, including Lamborghini. The Italian company now plans to delay the launch of its first EV by a year, according to the CEO.
Lamborghini boss Stephan Winkelmann told reporters this week that the EV will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028, according to Reuters. Winkelmann said he did not believe 2029 was too late to launch an EV, adding that the company does not think the segment will be ready for EVs by 2026.
The automaker is also waiting for potential changes to the European Union’s combustion engine ban set for 2035, when a review takes place in 2026. Lamborghini has also expressed interest in the potential for synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines in new vehicles.
""We think this is the right way to face the future,"" Winkelmann said. ""There are discussions around synthetic fuels and this is an opportunity for our kind of cars"".
The automaker’s first EVs won’t be a supercar. Instead, it’ll be a four-seat grand tourer previewed by the Lanzador concept in 2023. Winkelmann said earlier this year that electric supercars weren’t selling well, and might never truly entice consumers.

The feds have $7,500 to offer, while Colorado adds another $5,000 to the pot to bring costs down.
In a sea of new EVs, the 500e is odd. It has a 42-kilowatt-hour battery offering up to 149 miles of range on a single charge, with its front-mounted single motor providing propulsion. It’s also not cheap if you decide to purchase outright, with a starting price of $34,095 (including the $1,595 destination charge) before any incentives. The hatchback's small size and limited range make it perfect for urban driving, but also limits its audience.
Fiat has been struggling to sell the EV since its launch, most recently having to pause production at its Mirafiori, Italy, factory where it builds the 500e. The pause started at the end of last month, and the automaker appears to have extended the shutdown another two weeks until January 20, according to a new Reuters report.
The lease deal ends December 31, and it’s only available to Colorado residents. Lessees will have the option to purchase the EV for $17,388 once the lease expires.

Mercedes-AMG Shows Its Electric Performance SUV For The First Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/744219/mercedes-amg-performance-suv-prototype-testing/,"The speedy SUV will have over 1,000 horsepower.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Mercedes-AMG is building two standalone performance vehicles: A high-powered SUV and a four-door coupe. The duo will use the brand's new AMG.EA architecture, and for better or worse, they'll both be electric. Today, we get our first official glimpse of the SUV in action, undergoing cold-weather testing in Sweden. And it looks… interesting.
Previewed earlier this year in a silhouette sketch, this is the first time anyone has seen the Mercedes-AMG SUV prototype on the road. Under all that camouflage the SUV has a four-door coupe-like design with a sharp front end and sleek bodywork. It will be similar in size to the current GLS, but best of all, it won't look anything like the current crop of Mercedes EQ products.
Details on the powertrain are still scarce, but we expect this SUV to be plenty powerful, and hopefully, equally as efficient. Mercedes has confirmed that the SUV will use axial flux motors and a new high-performance battery pack offering a 40-percent boost in energy density. That will yield an output of over 1,000 horsepower.
The current Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV is currently the most powerful AMG EV in the lineup. It has a 90.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 617 horsepower and 701 pound-feet of torque, which sends it to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds. This new SUV should be significantly brawnier.
Mercedes-AMG also released images of the four-door coupe undergoing testing in the snow, which we saw earlier this year. The electric sedan will replace the current AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, and use the same disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors as the SUV with an ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight.""
Expect to see both models in the metal sometime early in 2025.

The Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Way More Expensive Than The Gas Version,https://www.motor1.com/news/744052/escalade-iq-price/,"The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ starts at $129,900 including destination. That's over $40,000 than the cheapest gas-powered Escalade.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Cadillac has released pricing for the Escalade IQ, the all-electric version of its extremely popular luxury people-mover. The 2025 Escalade IQ will start at $129,900 with the $2,290 destination fee included, which is over $40,000 more than the cheapest gas-powered model.
Despite the similar names, the electric IQ and the gas-powered Escalade are fairly different SUVs. While the standard Escalade shares its squared-off bones and V-8 engine with its GM counterparts from Chevy and GMC, the IQ uses the platform found on trucks like the Hummer EV and Silverado EV. It's a foot longer than the gas Escalade and comes with its own body design that's far more sculpted and swept back, to improve aerodynamics.
The Escalade IQ will launch in four trims: Luxury 1, Sport 1, Luxury 2, and Sport 2. No matter which you choose, you'll get a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain powered by an Ultium battery pack with over 200.0 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity. Cadillac says this setup is good for 750 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque, with an estimated range of 460 miles. Pricing with destination for each trim can be seen below.
Aside from styling details like exterior trim and door handles, Luxury 1 and Sport 1 are essentially the same, equipment-wise. Both get standard features like a panoramic glass roof, 24-inch wheels, LED lighting, and rain-sensing wipers. Inside you'll find acres of synthetic leather, heated and ventilated seats, five-zone climate control, and a massive 55.0-inch display for the gauge cluster and infotainment screen.
Step up to Luxury 2 or Sport 2, and you get a 36-speaker sound system by AKG, massaging front seats, and different LED lighting. Importantly, going for either of the two higher trims adds a trailering package as standard, which comes with things like better blind-spot detection, a trailer brake controller, and a suite of apps and camera views to make the trailering experience easier. Opting for Sport or Luxury 2 also allows you to add the Executive Second Row Seating Package, which installs 14-way adjustable seats to the second row, as well as a center console with flip-out tables.
The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is expected to arrive at dealerships by the end of the year.

Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

Lucid Could Use Two-Speed Transmissions In Future EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/743104/lucid-two-speed-electric-vehicle-patent/,The American automaker is interested in two-speed transmissions that allow electric motors to operate in ideal ranges at different speeds.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Although Lucid already makes the world's most efficient electric cars, it's keen to extend its lead. One area other automakers like Porsche have explored to boost their EVs' range is the use of two-speed transmissions. Lucid has yet to do so, but now it looks like it might apply the technology in its own unique way.
If you don't know how Lucid's drive unit works, you should read up on it. The system is ingenious and, as it turns out, flexible. The electric motor's speed is reduced from tens of thousands of RPM down to wheel speeds by two separate planetary gearsets on either end of the casing. This allows the motor and gearboxes to be coaxial, reducing the drive unit's size and mass. Planetary gearboxes can also be used as transmissions by braking separate parts of the mechanism, and that's what Lucid is doing here.
A patent applied for back in 2023 and recently granted to the automaker describes part of this system, although the precise design seems somewhat obscured. Several patents reference different aspects of what is likely a new drive unit configuration, so the exact nature of it all isn't entirely clear just by reading this one document.
What we can nail down, though, is that the system uses one or more planetary sets on either side of a coaxial drive unit to achieve its two speeds. A system of one-way clutches enables these two ratios. How much of a difference in efficiency can this make? Automakers and suppliers have claimed gains in the region of five percent, although it's going to depend on how and where you drive.
Lucid might be shooting higher than that with this unique design. In recent interviews, the automaker's chief executive, Peter Rawlinson, has claimed the company wants to achieve six miles per kilowatt-hour. For reference, the most efficient Lucid Air can currently achieve about five miles per kilowatt-hour. Do the math on a car with a 100kWh battery; it's a big difference not only in pure range, but also the rate at which charging gets you miles back in the battery. Any charging speed is effectively multiplied by the drivetrain's efficiency.
We know Lucid's SUV, the Gravity, is coming soon. Another mid-size car is coming after that. It's plausible that this new drivetrain tech could be applied to any vehicle in the automaker's lineup, though. An updated Air sedan could see a two-speed transmission get added to at least one axle, although that's pure speculation. Until the automaker pipes up, we won't know its plans for this tech.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Rally Actually Rocks: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/742491/2024-ford-mustang-mach-e-rally-review/,This isn't just another crossover with a badge—the Mach-E Rally is genuinely good on the dirt.,12/25/2024 8:49,"There are so many crossovers out there pretending to be off-roaders. Hell, you can get a toughened-up Nissan Rogue these days (and honestly, it's not half bad). But for the most part, adding grippier wheels and faux running boards to a crossover does not an off-roader make.
Ford at least put some effort into the new Mach-E Rally. It has a 1.0-inch lift, optimized springs, genuine underbody protection, and a pretty nifty body kit to boot. Tack on the Mach-E GT's powerful output and you've got yourself a genuinely fun little off-road EV.
With two electric motors and a 91.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the Mach-E Rally has 480 horsepower and a whopping 700 pound-feet of torque. Alongside the GT, it's the most powerful Mach-E money can buy—hell, it's one of the torquiest EVs on sale anywhere today.
Tick over to the Mach-E’s “Unbridled” powertrain mode to uncork all 700 lb-ft. A huge wave of electrons launch the rally-ready SUV to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds—just a tenth of a second slower than the standard GT—and on to a limited top speed of 128 mph. It's quick as heck. There's even a faux acceleration sound that's pretty convincing at speed (it sounds like a rumbly V-6).
Ford tweaked the suspension specifically for off-road use. But that also means the Mach-E Rally is plenty compliant on pavement, too. Standard MagneRide shocks, slightly softer dampers, and tweaks to the anti-roll bars and bushings give it a more pliable yet still compliant ride.
There's a titch more body roll when you flick this Mach-E hard into a turn compared to other trims in the model range, presumably from the added ride height. But it handles well otherwise. It has ample body control, excellent balance, and a light but responsive steering feel.
There is some tire noise from the chunkier Michelin CrossClimate2 all-seasons, especially at highway speeds. And that massive rally-style wing makes rearward visibility a thing of the past. But who cares, this thing was made for rallying.
Since I'm about 5,000 miles and an ocean away from Col de Turini, a dinky dirt road is the next-best option. Step one is to dig into the touchscreen (mildly annoying) and select the RallySport drive mode, made specifically for the Mach-E Rally. Activating this mode smooths out the throttle response—instead of an instant shove of torque, power arrives in a more linear way. This mode also softens the dampers and relaxes the traction control just enough to allow you to rip off some sweet dirt drifts. If you really want to get wacky, you can disengage traction control entirely.
Even on this tight dirt road with a few tiny corners, the Mach-E Rally is an absolute hoot. Prod the throttle and yank the steering wheel hard to send the back end into a tidy, refined drift. Get up to speed and the softened suspension skips over rocks and powers through ruts like a genuine rally car, while the chunkier rubber claws its way through the dirt.
There's a bit of cladding on the fenders and side sills to protect it from kicked-up rubble, and a film on the doors helps to save the paint. There's even genuine underbody protection in the form of two panels, front and rear.
The one downside is that the Mach-E Rally doesn't have a limited-slip differential. Instead, it uses brake-based torque vectoring, which is less predictable and harder on the rotors. For the 95 percent of owners who won't take this thing to an actual rally stage, it's no big issue. But for the slim majority who might actually aim this car down a logging road in earnest, you'll have to live without that one key feature.
Otherwise, Ford made a genuinely compelling Mach-E rally car. And it still has all the things that make the standard Mach-E such a great electric SUV.
The extended-range battery comes standard on the Rally model, which gives it 265 miles on a single charge. Plugging into a 150-kilowatt DC fast charger refills it in just over 35 minutes, and there's a one-pedal mode for ultra-efficient driving.
The interior feels premium and airy, with high-end materials almost everywhere you look (apart from a chintzy-feeling rotary shift controller). The Rally model adds gloss white accents on the steering wheel and dash, and a unique trapezoidal pattern shared with the exterior. And love it or hate it, you get the same 15.5 vertical touchscreen found on other Mach-Es with functions like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. It even has BlueCruise hands-free highway driving (a $2,100 option with a three-year subscription).
Not to mention the Mach-E Rally just looks cool as hell. The 19-inch rally-inspired white wheels fit the personality of the car perfectly, the custom grille with two integrated fog lights further hammers home the rally theme, and that massive rear wing looks awesome, which Ford says was inspired by the Focus RS. My test car had two slick racing stripes down the middle with that same trapezoidal pattern from the cabin, though unfortunately, an uninspired Glacier Gray paint job. Go for one of the good colors; Grabber Blue, Grabber Yellow, or Eruption Green.
With a starting price of $60,990 and an as-tested price of $65,485, it’s definitely not the cheapest performance crossover out there ($55,890 for the Mach-E GT AWD and the Rally trim is another $6,000 on top of that). But while I was expecting another warmed-over soft-roader, the Mustang Mach-E Rally was genuinely impressive and thoroughly charming.
See, electric SUVs can be fun.

"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,12/25/2024 8:49,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

"Fiat 500e Production Paused, Again",https://www.motor1.com/news/742532/fiat-500-electric-production-paused/,Two Maserati models will also be out of commission for a whole month.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Oh, here we go again. Stellantis has no other option but to pause production of the Fiat 500e. Demand for the electric city car continues to be poor, forcing another hiatus at the Mirafiori plant. The Italian factory suspended output several times this year and it's about to do it once more. After telling unions that operations would be suspended from December 18 until January 5, it’s now adding the December 2-17 interval to the stoppage.
Consequently, the Fiat 500e will not be assembled from Monday, December 2, until Sunday, January 5, 2025. It’s not just the diminutive hatchback impacted by the low demand as Maserati is facing an identical problem. Production of the GranTurismo and GrabCabrio will also be halted during this interval. Through the voice of Stellantis’ head honcho Carlos Tavares, the exotic brand recently blamed bad marketing for sluggish sales.
Fiat’s parent company says activities at its factory in Turin will be temporarily stopped due to a ""continuing uncertainty in sales of electric cars in several European markets.” EVs account for 97% of the production at the Mirafiori facility. Stellantis goes on to say it’s putting the brakes on Maserati production as well due to low demand for luxury cars outside Europe, such as the United States and China.
The wheels are in motion to resuscitate sales of the new Fiat 500 by selling a version with a combustion engine. The plan is to roll out a hybrid 500 in 2026 when production will commence at the same Italian site. Made in Poland, the previous-generation model is still sold in certain regions with gas power. Yes, we’re talking about a car that originally hit the market in 2007. Its Abarth hot hatch counterpart is still available, but Fiat’s performance division has already announced plans to go purely electric.

Volkswagen Is Planning A Major Design Overhaul With More Buttons,https://www.motor1.com/news/742405/vw-design-overhaul-more-buttons/,"It also wants to improve interior quality, leading with the next ID.3 and ID.4.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Facing plant closures and massive layoffs, it’s safe to say Volkswagen has lost its mojo. The years when the Golf used to dominate sales charts in Europe seem like distant memories. The so-so styling of its electric cars isn’t exactly driving people into showrooms, and the oversimplified interiors aren't helping either. All while prices increase, forcing customers to reconsider their options.
But a fix is on the way, or so VW pledges. In an interview with Auto Express, VW’s development boss Kai Grünitz promised significant changes are planned. The next ID.3 and ID.4 will usher in a ""completely new design language."" That’s great to hear since the bulbous EVs could really need a fresh look. He went on to say a revamped visual identity will mark a return to form by going “back to where we originally came from, from a design perspective, and return to what Volkswagen is known for.”
Stepping inside, the user interface will also be improved by bringing back more traditional controls. Expect future VWs to feature extra buttons to quickly access often-used functions instead of having to rely on submenus on the touchscreen. Aside from adding back conventional keys as previewed by the ID.2all concept, a boost in quality is on the way. That’s one of the major problems the Golf Mk8 is facing, especially when compared to its excellent predecessor.
But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard promises about nicer interiors. At the end of 2022, VW Group chairman Oliver Blume talked about a “quality offensive.” As you can imagine, these changes don’t happen overnight. We’ll have to wait for the next generation of cars to see whether the folks from Wolfsburg live up to their promises.
Talking specifically about the ID.3 and ID.4, Kai said VW will also bring “a lot of improvements in terms of battery costs and performance.” He went as far as to say the overhauled EVs “will be a huge improvement” for both the automaker (by driving down production costs) and its customers by getting better cars overall. The new electric vehicles are expected to arrive in 2026.
It’s too soon to say whether the ID.3 will keep its name. VW has already announced the ninth-generation Golf is going to be electric, with the Mk8 to continue with combustion engines until as late as 2035. At the beginning of the year, Kai strongly hinted the return of the electric Golf could kill the ID.3: “There is not enough space to have two or three different models fitting to the same customer. We've started to work on a fully electric Golf.”

Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",12/25/2024 8:49,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

It's Happening: Chrysler Confirms A Pacifica EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/741995/chrysler-pacifica-ev-coming-soon/,Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell revealed plans for the battery-powered minivan at the 2024 LA Auto Show.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Right now, Chrysler's only offering to the motoring world is the Pacifica minivan. Technically, the Voyager was resurrected for 2025, but that's really just a Pacifica with fewer options and a lower price tag. Now, we learn another Pacifica variant is coming, this time as a full-on EV.
That's what Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell told Green Car Reports at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show. Design details or a specific debut timeframe weren't mentioned. Chrysler did not immediately respond to comment when reached by Motor1 for confirmation and additional information.
In the report, Feuell alludes to the Halcyon concept as influencing the Pacifica EV. Debuting in February 2024, the Halcyon is actually a sleek, sizable sedan riding on the STLA Large platform. It followed the Chrysler Airflow concept, a sharp electric crossover from 2022 that had a production-ready vibe. The automaker's decision to essentially abandon plans for producion in 2023 came as a surprise, but Feuell reportedly wanted something more modern to take the company into the future.
Chrysler Halcyon Concept
Chrysler Airflow Concept
This whole situation is not without some irony. The Airflow concept utilized the same platform as the Pacifica, which will eventually have an electric version with Halcyon-influenced styling. Meanwhile, Chrysler is supposed to debut its first EV next year— a crossover likely using the STLA Large platform with Airflow influence. Interesting.
We have many questions at this point, including whether Chrysler is still on schedule for its first EV in 2025. Delays have affected other electric ambitions from brands within Stellantis, and we've heard precious little from Chrysler since the Halcyon's debut in February. The current Pacifica should get a significant update for 2026, which likely places a Pacifica EV debuting in late 2026 or 2027.
Of course, this all depends on Stellantis not killing Chrysler before then. The conglomerate's serious financial crisis prompted warnings from CEO Carlos Tavares that underperforming brands could be cut in as little as two or three years.

The Nissan N7 Is A Big Electric Sedan You Can’t Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/741084/2025-nissan-n7-electric-sedan/,Unless you're willing to move to China.,12/25/2024 8:49,"In a sea of electric crossovers and SUVs, a good ol' sedan is a nice change of pace. However, there’s still a problem. Nissan’s new EV will be made in China exclusively for the local market. The N7 was developed with local partner Dongfeng through their 50:50 joint venture. If it weren’t for the badge, I’d honestly be hard-pressed to identify this car as a Nissan.
If the N7 already looks familiar, Dongfeng Nissan previewed the production model in April with the Epoch concept. It’s a sleek sedan that ticks all the design trend boxes in 2024: split headlights, a rear light bar, an illuminated logo, two-tone wheels, and a swoopy roofline. The LED daytime running lights send a bit of a Hyundai vibe, but the boomerang-shaped lights below give the car a unique front fascia.
Some would be tempted to say this is Nissan’s first-ever electric sedan. However, that’s not the case. The Leaf-based Sylphy Zero Emission was launched in 2018 as the company’s first EV made for the Chinese market. Just how big is the N7? At 194 inches (4930 millimeters) long and 74.6 inches (1895 millimeters) wide, it’s roughly the same size as a Volkswagen ID.7. However, it sits closer to the road, at 58.5 inches (1487 millimeters) tall. It measures 114.7 inches (2915 millimeters) between the axles, so the wheelbase is a tad shorter than the VW’s.
Nissan isn’t willing to show the interior just yet, nor is it ready to divulge technical specifications beyond the car’s measurements. We do know it sits on a locally developed modular electric architecture and will be offered with a “Navigate on Autopilot” advanced driver-assist system. Inside, the touchscreen should run smoothly courtesy of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295P processor.
The N7 will go on sale in China during the first half of 2025. It’s one of several models included in Nissan’s “The Arc” midterm plan, which will allow the Dongfeng Nissan joint venture to accelerate the launch of hybrid and electric vehicles in China. This strategy calls for a total of 30 models globally by 2027, including seven vehicles for the United States.

Ford Is Already Cutting New EV Production,https://www.motor1.com/news/740842/ford-cuts-explorer-capri-ev-production/,The company blames the 'rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles.',12/25/2024 8:49,"Although the Explorer Electric was unveiled in March 2023, Ford didn’t start production until June this year. First shown in July, the Capri reboot hit the assembly line in September. Now, Ford's European business is already reducing output at the Cologne factory in Germany. Why? Because the two Volkswagen-related products are not selling all that well.
German newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger learned from a Ford spokesperson the “rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles” are putting the brakes on Explorer and Capri production. Employees will have no other way but to alternate between working one week and taking one week off until the Christmas vacation. It’s a huge blow to the Cologne operations considering Ford invested $2 billion to get the German plant ready for EV production.
It’s rare for an automaker to slow down a vehicle that has only been in production for a few months. Ford’s electric offensive in Europe came at the expense of the Fiesta, its popular supermini that was shockingly retired from the factory in July 2023. To make matters worse, the company doesn’t have many ICE cars left to fall back on since the Mondeo made in Valencia, Spain died in 2022 and the Focus will be retired in 2025 from the Saarlouis site in Germany.
Through the first nine months of the year, Ford’s market share in the European Union, the UK, and the European Free Trade Association/EFTA region (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) fell from 4.1% to only 3.3%. Numbers published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) show Ford sold only 326,975 passenger cars, down by 18% compared to the January-September 2023 interval.
Automotive News Europe reports additional production cuts at the Cologne factory are planned for early 2025. The company’s first carbon-neutral site has a maximum annual capacity of 250,000 EVs, but hitting that number seems like a pipe dream for now.
Another electric Ford, the F-150 Lightning, is also going through a rough patch. Production at the Dearborn plant in Michigan will be paused from November 15 until January 6, 2025, because of poor demand. The seven-week shutdown includes the usual week-long holiday break and is the second time Ford has idled production. It first happened in February for nine weeks due to quality issues that weren’t solved until April.

The Quickest Cars In The World Are EVs. Here's How They Stack Up In A Drag Race,https://www.motor1.com/news/740382/rimac-nevera-tesla-plaid-lucid-sapphire/,"These three street cars have 4,168 combined horsepower. But only one can be quickest.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Looking for the quickest production cars on the planet? You've found them. Every car in this new Dragtimes video is incredibly quick. At 1,020 horsepower, the Tesla Model S Plaid is actually the underdog here, because it's facing the 1,234-hp Lucid Air Sapphire. And both are playing second fiddle to the Rimac Nevera. At 1,914 hp, it's the most powerful production EV in the world.
And all three are lined up on a runway for half-mile drag racing. That's 4,168 combined horses, all in one place.
The video doesn't open with the grand finale. The super sedans race first, ripping to 60 mph in about 1.5 seconds and running quarter-mile times in the low-nine-second range, according to Dragy data. The winner at the half-mile mark is the more powerful Lucid,  crossing the line in 14.42 seconds at 186 mph. The Tesla also reached 186 mph but was a bit slower mid-track, reaching the finish line in 14.56 seconds
Race number two pits the Nevera against the Sapphire, and actually, it's closer than you might expect. Being on an unprepared surface, the 1,914-hp Rimac struggles getting power to the ground. That's reflected in a 0-60 mph time of 2.6 seconds, giving Lucid the early lead. That's soon vanquished, however, as the Nevera flashes past en route to a 13.84-second half-mile time. Its speed at the finish line is 203.9 mph. As for the Sapphire, it lost. But considering the disparity in power between the two cars, the margin isn't as big as you'd expect.
That, finally, brings us to the headlining act for this showdown, which plays out over two races. The first starts from a dig, and as before, the Rimac struggles with traction early on. Both sedans move ahead, but the Lucid Air Sapphire is an absolute monster. It leads the Nevera for nearly the entire half-mile run, only losing out at the very end.
The second race starts from a 40 mph roll. With no traction issues and a Hellcat's worth of extra horsepower over the Lucid, you can probably guess which car wins. But the battle for second place is a legit nail-biter. It shows how the sedans are set up differently for acceleration and speed.
No matter which

This Honda Was Its First EV—25 Years Before The Prologue: Video,https://www.motor1.com/features/740259/honda-ev-plus-close-up/,The Honda EV Plus was the first modern EV to hit American streets - in 1997. This video takes a close look at the last one in the US.,12/25/2024 8:49,"The Honda EV Plus might just be the most important EV you've never heard of. This electric car was the first on the American market to use something besides lead-acid car batteries for power. Instead, it used an innovative nickel-metal hydride battery and a Honda-developed brushless motor for an impressive 81 miles of range—in 1997, a decade before the Nissan Leaf was unveiled.
What's even more fascinating is this JDM-looking machine was actually just for Americans. Honda developed it specifically for California to comply with turn-of-the-century EV-mandate laws in the state. after half a decade of research and development, Honda built just 300 of these tiny electric hatchbacks and leased them as fleet and corporate vehicles. They roamed Californian roads for roughly half a decade, and then Honda ended the leases, took the cars back, and crushed 298 of them.
There are two remaining EV Pluses left on Earth, both owned by Honda. I got the rare chance to see one of these two at Honda's headquarters in Torrence, California, and what struck me was just how normal the EV Plus was. Air conditioning, power brakes, electric windows, a heater—all there. It may seem like common-sense that an electric car has all these features in a post-Tesla era, but these were all things that, up until this car, were generally excluded from penalty-box EVs that had to prioritize weight savings and range to squeeze every last drop of mileage out of highly inefficient lead-acid batteries.
While the EV Plus ultimately was relegated to a historical footnote after it became clear that lithium-ion batteries, not nickel-metal hydride, would become the standard for EV power, it's still a fascinating time capsule to the early days of electrification, and I'm excited I got to check it out up close.

The Electric Mercedes CLA Broke A Porsche Taycan Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/740107/electric-mercedes-cla-breaks-record/,CEO Ola Källenius says the new CLA is the 'most intelligent car' the company has ever made.,12/25/2024 8:49,"The new CLA isn’t even out yet, but Mercedes is happy to report that its smallest sedan has already set a record. The first fully electric version managed to cover 2,309 miles in a 24-hour interval, besting a record established by Porsche in 2019. The Taycan did 2,128 miles at the same Nardo test track in Italy—the CLA EV beat it by 181 miles.
On the 7.8-mile Nardo Ring banked oval, the zero-emission CLA averaged 95 miles per hour and had to be recharged 40 times, with each stop taking about 10 minutes. The electric compact sedan didn’t move for about 6 hours and 40 minutes, or nearly 28% of the 24 hours. Rather than making fewer, longer stops, Mercedes capitalized on the car’s 800V electric architecture and DC charging, enabling an initial charge boost.
During the record-breaking run, which actually took place back in April, the near-production prototype’s battery dropped to 10% before the CLA made those 40 pit stops to recharge it back to 55% or a bit more. The car only covered approximately 60 miles between charges. Mercedes remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications, but we do know that it used a rear-wheel-drive variant with a single motor and a two-speed transmission. A beefier dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model will be offered.
Although the brand is focusing on the electric CLA, there will be versions with a combustion engine. The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe rival will be offered with a newly developed 2.0-liter gasoline engine made in China by Horse Powertrain. If that doesn't ring a bell, it’s a joint venture between Geely and Renault. We’ll remind you that Chinese investor Li Shufu, founder and chairman of Geely, has a 9.69% share in Mercedes. Side note–China's BAIC Group has another 9.98% of the company’s voting rights.
The overhauled CLA will go on sale next year, but the initial variants will be electric. The mild-hybrid models are expected to hit the market about six months later. The sedan will be joined by another CLA Shooting Brake, which should once again be a traditional wagon despite its fancy title. The Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture will also underpin the next-gen GLA and GLB crossovers.
The off-road-oriented “Little “G” announced last year is likely to utilize the same MMA platform. We’re not expecting another A-Class sedan or a B-Class minivan.

California Forced Automakers To Build EVs In The '90s. They Were Doomed From The Start,https://www.motor1.com/features/738827/trendsetting-yet-forgotten-japanese-evs/,"Decades before the Prologue, BZ4X, or even the Leaf, Japan built a batch of special electric cars just for America.",12/25/2024 8:49,"When we think of iconic Japanese cars, the influential models from the motherland spring to mind—the 1JZ A70 Supra, the R34 Skyline, the 2000GT. But after Japanese marques established a foothold in the States, some of their most interesting projects were built just for us. Take, for example, the earliest commercially viable electric cars produced by the Japanese Big Three. While forgotten today, this trio laid the groundwork for our modern era. These early EVs existed solely because of, and for, Americans.
In 1990, the California Air Resources Board passed its first zero-emissions vehicle (or “ZEV”) mandates. They applied to every large automaker selling cars in the state, and they were remarkably aggressive. The rules stated that by 1998, 2% of a car company’s total sales in California had to be zero-emission. By 2003, a staggering 10% of a carmaker’s vehicles sold in the state would need to be ZEVs. While last year, over a quarter of new cars sold in California were zero-emission, in 1990, 10% was unimaginable.
In 1990, the best-selling EV in American history was this: the Vanguard-Sebring CitiCar/Commuter Vehicles Comuta-Car, first introduced in 1974 in the deepest throes of the fuel crisis. It boasted 40 miles of range, a top speed of 40 miles per hour (headwind-limited), and anywhere from 2.5 to 6 horsepower. Power was supplied via a 48-volt array of lead-acid golf cart batteries. It cost $2,998 at its launch. By the time it finally died in the early Eighties, roughly 4,400 had been sold.
After Commuter Vehicles discontinued building its doorstop on wheels in 1982, basically no commercially successful attempts at an EV hit the market for the next decade. This put automakers in an intense bind. They had to develop zero-emissions vehicles essentially from scratch, and they had to do it fast or risk losing the massive and invaluable California car market entirely.
In 1990, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all sold enough cars in California to meet the terms of the mandate. All three companies began work on EVs so as not to lose this valuable market.
By the time the 1998 deadline rolled around, manufacturers and the California state government realized that building tens of thousands of commercially feasible EVs in just eight years would be entirely impossible. The regulations were softened to require just a few hundred cars to be produced (the exact number would depend on exactly how many cars the manufacturer had sold in the state in previous years). Still, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all needed to develop vehicles. The three companies came up with wildly innovative cars, all with a different spin on early EV technology.
Toyota was later to the EV rush than some of its contemporaries, not unlike today, with its research program starting late in 1992. The company hit the ground quickly, though, and developed a handful of lease-only Japanese market EV prototypes by 1993, including a lead-acid battery-powered Townace van and a Crown Majesta fleet sedan. Serious progress wouldn’t come until 1995, however, when the RAV4 EV initiative began.
Some early RAV4 EVs sported similar lead-acid battery technology that the Comuta-car—and every EV dating back to the dawn of the electric car—had used. Manufacturers, including Toyota, rapidly realized that lead-acid batteries simply would not cut it for mass-market cars. Lead-acid batteries degrade relatively rapidly when repeatedly run from full to zero charge, and they have a terrible energy density at just 35 watt-hours per kilogram.
For an idea of how poor this performance is, the 118.0-kilowatt-hour Lucid Air Grand Touring battery, if it were composed of lead-acid batteries, would weigh 7,431 pounds by itself. (It would also probably need its own travel trailer—lead-acid batteries are generally not compact.) As a result of this terrible energy density, electric cars in the 90s were facing what’s known to engineers as the tyranny of the rocket equation: to get more payload (or range), you have to add more fuel, which means more weight. That additional fuel weight necessitates more fuel. Eventually, you’re adding extra fuel just to launch the extra fuel.
To get more range out of EVs without sacrificing every modern convenience, a new power solution was required. In 1995, Toyota partnered with Panasonic to use their new nickel-metal hydride (or NiMH) batteries. These batteries, which were a relatively recent development, possessed twice the energy density of lead-acid batteries at roughly 70 watt-hours per kilogram, were lower maintenance, and required fewer toxic materials to build. Toyota began testing by putting a set in a limited-production, three-door RAV4 and entering it in the First Scandinavian Electric Car Rally, a 351-mile race from Göteborg, Sweden to Oslo, Norway. The RAV4 won.
After building roughly 100 three-door versions for Japan and Europe, the company fixed its sights on the California market in time for the 1998 mandate. The company built five-door, left-hand-drive RAV4 models with nickel-metal hydride batteries starting in 1997. These larger models had more storage space, as the batteries would fit entirely under the floor. They also featured all the creature comforts that American buyers expected—airbags, ABS, heated seats, air-conditioning, heating—and a slightly more powerful motor.
By modern standards, it was still a tame EV, with a top speed of just 78 miles an hour and an EPA-rated range of 95 miles, but it worked.  These cars were first offered solely to public utilities and fleet buyers as leases—typical for the early EV era—in small quantities. Toyota produced 1,484 in total, making it the most widely produced of any EV of this era.
Unlike its Nissan and Honda contemporaries, however, Toyota offered the public the chance to buy the Toyota RAV4 EV in 2002. Toyota reported 328 sales—not shabby for an MSRP of $42,000, or roughly $75,000 in today’s dollars—and there are still RAV4 EVs on the road today. The NiMH battery technology was easily adapted to the Prius, where it was used in the first three generations of cars. It also was found underpinning one of its competitors.
Honda’s initial strategy mirrored Toyota’s. Take a global-market gas vehicle, slap some lead-acid batteries and an electric motor into it, and go for a spin. The company’s first serious EV project began in 1990, and a team of roughly 100 engineers turned a Honda CR-X into an EV with off-the-shelf parts. The car made its maiden test run in mid-1991, but it was a letdown to Honda executives. Junichi Araki, project lead, was especially displeased; he reportedly said “You call this a car? What the heck did you just make?” The team re-oriented itself with the goal of building “the finest EV in the world”, and started from scratch.
Testing continued through the mid-90s in California and Japan with a variety of platforms, including a modified Wagovan and a fully rebodied Civic called the “CUV-4”. The CUV-4 was a more complete vehicle than the chopped-and-hacked CRX that preceded it, but it still used lead-acid batteries, and as a result, achieved a dismal 30 miles of maximum range in the heat of Southern California. Honda ultimately came to the same conclusion as Toyota: new technology was needed. Nickel-metal hydride batteries were sourced, and the lightly modified Civic platform was ditched in favor of a heavily modified Honda Logo design, the subcompact successor to the JDM Honda City.
Like the Toyota RAV4 EV, Honda kept focus on ensuring the new EV—christened the EV Plus—would retain all of the functionality of a traditional petroleum-powered machine. Air conditioning, heating, a stereo, power locks, and a full suite of safety features were standard. Honda also went the extra mile for the drivetrain, internally developing its own DC brushless motor. This was unusual for the era, as EVs were still so niche that off-the-shelf components were the only way to make them remotely economical. The decision did give the Honda EV Plus a notable boost over its competition: while it only had 66 horsepower, it made 203 pound-feet of torque. That was good enough for a sub-five-second 0-30 time, and gave it acceleration that felt much more like a modern neck-snapping EV than the Comuta-Cars that preceded it.
Manufacturing of the EV Plus began at the Takanezawa plant—Honda’s specialty vehicle factory where the NSX, Insight, and S2000 all hailed from—in early 1997. By late 1997, the EV Plus was in the hands of California fleet buyers (as leases). This timing meant the EV Plus was technically the first mass-produced, non-lead-acid-battery EV ever to be in buyers’ hands, as it beat the RAV4 EV to market by a handful of months.
The car was moderately successful, and a modified version was even entered in the 1999 Pikes Peak hillclimb, setting a new record for the electric car class. Despite these successes, Honda pulled the plug on the EV Plus program virtually the second it met its CARB requirements in 1999, with somewhere around 330 cars produced in total and 300 on Californian roads. Although the EV Plus had an advertised MSRP of around $53,000 (over $100,00 in 2024 dollars), none were ever actually offered for sale.
By the early 2000s, California had given up on its aggressive EV mandates after realizing companies simply couldn’t manufacture them in vast numbers—and at the prices—that would be needed to hit a whopping 10% of new car sales. When CARB abandoned EVs, so did Honda, and the EV Plus leases were ended and the cars returned to Honda. Only two cars are known to exist today, both in Honda museums—the rest were all destroyed.
There was one more Japanese EV of the era, however, even less well-publicized than either the EV Plus or the RAV4 EV, and it proved to be the most prescient.
Nissan had the longest history of experimenting with electrification of any of the major Japanese OEMs, with its first production EV—the 1947 Tama E4S—developed in response to widespread oil and gas shortages in the wake of World War II. The E4S, first developed by the Tachikawa Aircraft Company (later the Tama Electric Car Company, then merged into Prince Motors, which would one day become Nissan) entered only limited manufacture as an urban taxi, but was the first of a handful of all-electric cars the company manufactured through the early 50s as fuel shortages continued.
1947 TAMA E4S
Nissan EV-4 Concept Truck
March EV Concept
Tama eventually stopped producing EVs as postwar Japan’s economy and supply chain recovered, but Nissan as a whole kept experimenting with EV technology in the coming decades. In 1973, the company debuted an all-electric cabover truck concept called the EV-4 that, while it never made production, boasted 180 miles of range, regenerative braking, and made it as far as crash testing. The company continued toying with the tech, building limited runs of an electrified Laurel sedan, an induction-motor powered March convertible, an Avenir cargo wagon, as well as other one-off models and concept cars.
The real breakthrough, however, came in 1996 with the Prairie Joy EV. The Prairie Joy EV was a simple conversion of a gas model (the Nissan Prairie minivan, sold briefly in America as the Axxess) like many of Nissan’s other attempts at electrification. However, this vehicle bore one significant difference: it was powered by lithium-ion batteries. Only thirty were built for Japanese fleet usage, but the initial results were strong: one of them did six years of service at the world’s northernmost permanent arctic settlement in Svalbard, Norway, proving the novel and unique lithium battery tech—which up until that point had only been used for small consumer electronics like phones and laptops—would last even in incredibly hostile conditions. Lithium also represented a massive leap in potential performance over NiMH batteries, as although they were expensive and required rare materials, the energy density could potentially reach three times that of NiMH.

With proven tech in hand, Nissan moved on to meeting the CARB requirements. The base vehicle would be the R’nessa minivan, a gas-powered car from the Japanese market. This new EV, known as the Altra, preserved modern functionality like keyless entry, heat and air conditioning, and power windows, and boasting a DC permanent magnet motor under the hood. The Altra EV also produced an impressive 83 horsepower, the most of any Japanese EV of its era.
Altra EV Battery Pack (Press photo, provided via Dean Case)
For power, Sony produced car-sized battery packs specially for Nissan’s EV project, assembling 96 individual cells into a 345v, 32.4-kWh unit. The pack wasn’t light for its output, at over 800 pounds, but the Altra EV boasted the longest range of any EV on the market at the time of its introduction, at an EPA-rated 90 miles (the GM EV1, when it was released with a NiMH pack in 1999, did manage to best this with 105 miles of range—but it was built specifically to be an EV). Additionally, the lithium-ion pack was projected to last ten years of driving before needing replacement, years longer than a lead-acid battery could last (and seven years longer than Honda projected the NiMH EV Plus battery would survive).
The lithium packs were wildly expensive: insider sources in the era estimated each battery cost Nissan $50,000-70,000 in 1997, more than the MSRP of $50,999. Like the Honda EV Plus, however, buying an Altra EV was a purely hypothetical exercise. None were ever sold to private customers; they were only used by Nissan employees and corporate lease customers. Around 200 were produced in total until the Altra was canned in 2002. Like the Honda EV Plus, when the remaining leases ended, the cars were rounded up and largely destroyed. As I researched this story, I could only confirm the existence of two Altras left on this Earth.
Obviously, repealing those CARB laws paused the development of EVs, as it was no longer required and the economies of scale simply didn’t allow their existence. The largest roadblocks in this era stemmed from a lack of battery development. NiMH, despite being a vast improvement over ancient lead-acid technology, suffered poor performance in extreme temperatures, high weight, and high pack costs.
Additionally, the specific battery design used by Toyota—which stuck with EVs the longest after the end of the CARB mandate—had its patent purchased by Texaco, which sued aggressively to stop further development. NiMH as an EV battery was dead in its tracks, although it still got mainstream usage in Honda’s Insight and Toyota’s Prius hybrids for years to come.
Still, lessons were learned. Motor tech advanced rapidly during this era. The dominant 400V standard for vehicle architecture was developed and standardized. J1772 charging—the standard for Level 2 for most companies until the past year—was developed from lessons learned from this era’s cars. Most importantly, lithium development continued, and currently underpins every major EV currently on the market. Nissan continued work on electric cars through the 2000s, and in 2009, the Nissan Leaf debuted as a purchasable mass-produced EV. It easily earned and retained the all-time electric vehicle sales crown until 2020, when Tesla finally surpassed it.
These forgotten cars laid the groundwork for the current era of electrification. Plus, they’re just cool—It can be easy to forget that EVs, now so ubiquitous, were once alien feats of electrical and automotive engineering. These cars offer a glimpse into an era of ingenuity that built the world we live in today.

It Sure Looks Like GM Is Copying Lucid's Homework,https://www.motor1.com/news/739460/gm-lucid-drive-unit-patent/,The Detroit automaker has a design for a new drive unit that incorporates one of Lucid's key mechanical concepts.,12/25/2024 8:49,"Lucid Motors builds the most efficient electric vehicles in the world, and the rest of the auto industry wants a piece of that efficiency. Some, like Aston Martin, see fit to simply purchase the automaker's tech. Others want to develop it for themselves. One of those companies appears to be General Motors, which recently applied for a patent on a compact electric drive unit that uses one of Lucid's key architectural features: the differential-in-rotor design.
For those unfamiliar, Lucid pioneered a unique structural approach to building compact and efficient electric drive units. In most cases, an electric motor consists of an outside stator and an inside rotor, the latter of which spins. Many electric vehicles have solid rotors, but the inside of this structure doesn't actually produce much torque. Lucid miniaturized its drive unit by making the rotor donut-shaped and putting the differential inside. Since it doesn't experience wheel torque directly, this diff can be much smaller, lighter, and more efficient. This tiny differential drives two coaxial planetary gearsets, which drive the wheels. The 49:30 mark in this video from Lucid explains this very smart innovation better than I can via text:
General Motors' patent application takes this core differential concept and applies it to a slightly different system. Interestingly, the automaker is cagey in the document about explicitly saying it's putting a small differential inside of the rotor. In fact, the three-dimensional drawings provided with the patent omit both the electric motor and differential completely. The two-dimensional illustrations provided with the patent make it clear that's what's going on, though.
The only real hint in the document text that the differential sits inside the rotor happens near the end of the patent, where it's stated that it sits ""upstream"" from the rest of the geartrain. Other than that, no other mention of the differential or rotor in the text describes their nested nature.
In the diagram, 301 is the rotor, 501 is the stator, and 600 is the differential.
To be clear, there are several differences between Lucid's drive unit and the one described in GM's patent. The first big difference is that GM's unit is not coaxial. The rotor, intermediate reduction gears, and axle outputs are all on different axes. GM's unit is likewise a locking differential. This means it could be used in a performance or off-road setting where locking the diff would be advantageous. Lucid's electric drive units do not have a mechanical locking feature, although the company's dual-motor drive units offer complex torque vectoring.
The crux of the patent is that this new design would be compact and extremely efficient, which is naturally the same concept Lucid is chasing. The document claims that ""In certain embodiments, the drive unit architecture described herein provides for up to 95% efficiency."" That's very impressive, if its true.
Until such a drive unit is released—this is just a patent, after all—we won't know if GM actually plans to do anything with this design. It's an appealing unit on paper, if not quite so theoretically compact as Lucid's, and chasing efficiency is everything for automakers building EVs.

Polestar Says Biden's China Tech Ban Will Kill Its Business,https://www.motor1.com/news/739301/polestar-china-tech-ban-kill-sales/,"A new rule could ban cars with certain Chinese technology from American roads, even ones built in the US.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Last month, the US Commerce Department proposed a new rule prohibiting the sale and import of connected cars from China and Russia into the United States. If it passes, Polestars says the rule could prevent it from selling the vehicles it builds in South Carolina in America.
Polestar, in a submitted comment to the department, said that the proposed rule as drafted ""would effectively prohibit Polestar from selling its cars in the United States."" The automaker highlighted its concerns with the rule's broad definitions, proposing the agency narrow the scope of the components and systems that would be included in the ban.
Ford echoed similar concerns in its comment about the wording, saying, ""That certain language in the proposed rule could be interpreted in an overly broad and unnecessarily expansive manner."" It could prevent automakers that build cars in China from selling them here—like the Lincoln Nautilus, which the Blue Oval builds in the People's Republic.
Nissan, Hyundai Motor Group, Volkswagen Group of America, Volvo, and Tesla also submitted comments. All proposed the agency better define the scope of the rules and refine the language to improve clarity.
Many also took issue with the proposed timeline. As written, the rule's software prohibitions would take effect for the 2027 model year, while the hardware restrictions would kick in for 2030. That's too soon, according to automakers. Usually, they design new products three to five years before production starts.
HMG said the limited timeline would prevent companies from complying with the requirements. Honda said the industry would need time to conduct proper testing and validation to limit ""the potential for creating other safety vulnerabilities."" VW asked the agency to delay implementing the hardware ban until 2031 to give it time to comply.
The newly proposed rule is just the latest in a series of legislative and policy moves intended to protect US national security as connected cars that collect troves of information hit American roads.

Very Original: Mopar EV-Swapped Plymouth GTX,https://www.motor1.com/news/739152/mopar-plymouth-gtx-electromod/,"The GTX Electromod showcases a potential EV conversion kit, so you too can remove the one thing that defines a classic muscle car.",12/25/2024 8:49,"Among the many gasoline and electric vehicles on display at SEMA this year will be a deliciously blue 1967 Plymouth GTX. Don't get excited about the wild V-8 engine under the hood of this modified muscle car, however. In its place is a single electric motor driving the rear wheels.
It's called the Plymouth GTX Electromod Concept, and it comes from Mopar, the decades-old parts division of Chrysler that is now the parts group for all of Stellantis. Back in the 1960s, Mopar dished out all kinds of performance upgrades for pretty much every V-8 in the Chrysler family. That includes the GTX, which debuted in 1967 as a humble Belvedere two-door hardtop muscled up with two engine options: a 375-horsepower 440 cubic inch (7.2) V-8, or the legendary 426 Hemi.
Flash forward to 2024, and Mopar is testing the waters with a conceptual electric conversion kit for classic cars. Called the e-Crate, it's not unlike the various Hellcat setups currently available for custom builds. At the heart is a 400-volt, 250-kilowatt electric drive module that installs neatly under the hood using custom mounts. Power comes from four battery packs, three of which are mounted in the trunk. The fourth is positioned up front behind the grille for better weight distribution, which is important considering each pack weighs 230 pounds. The system is rated for 73 kilowatt-hours and gives the GTX an estimated range of 250 miles.
But range and efficiency were never defining factors for a muscle car. It's all about power, and on that front, this GTX Electromod makes ""approximately 335 horsepower and torque,"" according to Mopar. That's less than the car's original 440, never mind the Hemi. There is no transmission; it goes to the rear wheels through a 3:1 gear reducer. So at least there's very little (if any) driveline loss. Performance stats aren't mentioned.
The rest of the car features typical restomod upgrades. It has a lowered suspension with 18-inch wheels and Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners. A custom hood is made from carbon fiber, and at the back, the wheel arches are wider. Bumpers front and rear are trimmed for a cleaner fit, and you won't find a lick of chrome anywhere. The blue interior has some personality, with bronze and stainless steel trim on the dash and door panels. There are new seats, a new center console, and digital gauges behind a retro-themed steering wheel. The Mopar team also added a cupholder, because all muscle cars need a cupholder.
This certainly isn't the first time we've seen a major automaker EV-swap a classic muscle car. And with the future still rolling (albeit slower) towards electric power, we doubt this will be the last.

We Rode Shotgun In Cadillac's Rolls-Royce Rival,https://www.motor1.com/features/736625/cadillac-celestiq-pre-production-riding-shotgun/,"We get an early ride in the $350,000 Cadillac Celestiq EV. Here's what it was like.",12/25/2024 8:49,"The Cadillac Celestiq starts at $340,000. It’s a handbuilt ultra-luxury sedan with its sights set on Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and the first of its kind in the General Motors lineup. While nobody in the press has had the opportunity to drive one yet, I recently got the chance to ride shotgun in the Celestiq to see what all the fuss was about.
The Celestiq is the brand’s most audacious car in recent memory. Not only does it stand alone in the automaker’s lineup price-wise, but it’s only the second high-end electric luxury car after the Rolls-Royce Spectre. The Cadillac is also completely bespoke and the only EV in GM’s current lineup to get a unique battery module design, which enables a thinner floor.
That long, thin battery is possible because the Celestiq is a huge car. Its scale and proportions aren’t immediately obvious in photos, but standing alongside it, I’m in awe of its size. I’m a few inches shy of six feet, and the 23-inch wheels are nearly up to my waist. At the same time, the roof of the car sits extremely low—well below my shoulders.
Pressing a button on the car’s B-pillar swings open the passenger door, and it latches shut with a soft close. I wasn’t driven long enough to get a great judgment on how comfortable the seats were, but they certainly weren't uncomfortable. But the most striking thing about sitting reclined in the Celestiq was how roomy and quiet it was.
The interior is unlike any other car I’ve experienced in terms of its size and shape. It’s extremely wide and long inside, yet the low roof and sleek window openings make it quite cozy. The flat floor also gives a concept car vibe to the whole experience. My Celestiq had about as basic an interior as any prospective owner might spec—black-on-black with some doubtlessly real walnut trim—but it still felt special. You could even see all the way back into the carefully upholstered trunk, adding to that sensation of spaciousness.
The burnt orange exterior was one of the better colors I’ve seen on this car, which was still a development mule. Behind the wheel was a GM software integration engineer. I asked him what didn’t work on this particular vehicle, and he said it was pretty much ready to go. On my side of the center tunnel was some electronic diagnostics equipment, but besides that, the vehicle seemed complete.
Browsing through menus as fast as I could, there weren’t any features I tried that didn’t function, including the variable-tint roof. With a single press, all the panels either go dark, remain clear, or can be adjusted individually to one of four levels. There was also an automatic setting.
In terms of the ride quality, it takes the smooth, serene qualities of the Lyriq to another level. The Celestiq didn’t really hit bumps; instead, it felt like it simply rose over them. Every time I spotted an imperfection on the tarmac, the Celestiq handled it better than I expected. The combination of air springs and GM’s latest magnetic ride control dampers in a vehicle with such a long wheelbase was incredible.
But the cherry on top was all the minute details. Switching on the heated seats also made the armrests balmy—not a new technology, but still great to have. All four passengers get a vent between the headrest and the seat, which blows hot or cold air on your neck. Mine was just barely blowing out some hot, dry air when I got in—almost imperceptibly—but it was very pleasant.
Until we drive a carefully tailored example, though, we won’t know what Cadillac has in store for buyers of its most expensive car. From my initial experience, the Celestiq checked a lot of boxes, even from the passenger’s seat. But stepping into the ultra-luxury space is difficult, even with many past concept cars predicting such a move.
The Celestiq is a fantastic canvas, but seeing if buyers are truly interested in customizing this cavernous Cadillac will be the real test.

Hyundai Gave The Kona A Weird Off-Road Makeover,https://www.motor1.com/news/738706/hyundai-kona-off-road-version/,It's named after the Earth's largest active volcano and looks like a 1990s base model.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Seemingly out of nowhere, there's a limited-run special edition of the electric Kona in Japan. Hyundai calls it the ""Mauna Loa"" after the biggest active volcano in the world. Painted in Mirage Green, the small crossover has been turned into a pseudo-offroader with Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires.
The chunky rubber measures 205/65 R16 and is combined with matte black wheels supplied by Weds. For better off-road chops, Hyundai installs smaller wheels compared to the regular model's 17-inch set with 215/60 R17 tires. We're not entirely sure whether that was the intention but the new wheels seem to mimic bedlock wheels used by proper go-anywhere vehicles.
Addressing the elephant in the room, the bumpers and side skirts make the Mauna Loa look like a base model from the 1990s. While those cars had unpainted bumpers to keep the price low, the Kona's are sprayed with scratch-resistant paint. That should make the body panels more durable when you’re off the beaten path in your electric Kona. Hyundai calls it a ""unique uneven finish"" with a textured look that has a ""subdued shine.""
Rounding off the upgrades on the outside are mudguards on all four wheels, black weatherstripping, dark badges, and standard roof bars for extra practicality. Stepping inside, Hyundai installs easy-to-clean floor mats and a cargo mat made from rubber as well. Much like the body, the interior is also predominantly green but with neon yellow accents for a contrasting effect.
Although the Kona Mauna Loa caters to outdoorsy people, Hyundai insisted on covering the seats in leather upholstery. We'd reckon cloth would've made more sense since it's easier to clean and more durable in time. Elsewhere, customers can get a few more accessories, including a folding chair and storage pockets that can be attached to the back of the front seats. Two different-sized cargo boxes are also available.
Hyundai is making only 30 units of the Kona Mauna Loa and is charging 4.95 million yen. At current exchange rates, that works out to about $32,500, making it about $2,800 more expensive than the electric Kona Voyage upon which it's based. It has the bigger 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for 336 miles.

The Kia Niro Tri-Fuel Is An Unusual Hybrid With Huge Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/738233/kia-niro-tri-fuel/,"It can cover 1,000 miles before refueling.",12/25/2024 8:50,"If you have a severe case of range anxiety, then a fully electric vehicle probably isn't the right choice. A hybrid makes more sense, especially if you frequently do long trips and don't want to worry about running out of juice. After Subaru launched a Crosstrek hybrid that can do 621 miles before refueling, Kia promises to smash the 1,000-mile barrier with its own electrified compact crossover.
The Niro Tri-Fuel isn't your run-of-the-mill hybrid crossover despite looking instantly familiar. That's because it also runs on liquified petroleum gas thanks to an LPG tank mounted under the cargo floor where you'd normally find the spare wheel. The LPG tank can store 10.5 gallons while the gas tank carries 11.1 gallons.
With two full tanks, the Niro Tri-Fuel can cover about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers)—a range EVs can only dream of. Even most diesels will struggle to reach that figure unless you're a fan of hypermiling. It gets better since the CO2 emissions are reduced by 6% compared to the regular hybrid. In Italy where this version is being launched, Kia says this is the first full-hybrid that can also run on LPG.
There's a button mounted next to the start/stop button the driver pushes to make the 1.6-liter engine run on LPG and check the amount of fuel left. The naturally aspirated four-cylinder unit produces 90 hp and works with an electric motor rated at 43 hp that draws its energy from a 1.32-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 126 hp and 195 lb-ft.
The conversion to LPG is performed by gas equipment company BRC part of the Westport Fuel Systems Italia but the car still comes with the full seven-year / 93,205-mile (150,000-km) warranty. Kia has done the math and believes an owner can save as much as €5,000 ($5,410) on refueling costs.
However, customers must pay a €2,000 (nearly $2,200) premium compared to the regular model. Pricing kicks off at €34,450 ($37,300) for the base model and rises to €39,200 ($42,400) for the flagship trim level.

Stellantis Could Make Fewer Gas Cars to Avoid Emissions Fines,https://www.motor1.com/news/738251/stellantis-cut-gas-car-production/,Production cuts might start next month.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Last month, Stellantis admitted it has too many unsold cars in North America. To get rid of excess inventory, it plans to assemble fewer cars in the coming months. Over in Europe, production could be cut as well, but for a different reason. The automotive conglomerate is concerned making too many ICEs will increase the risk of paying fines for exceeding fleet emissions targets.
Freshly appointed Chief Operating Officer of Stellantis' operations in Europe, Jean-Philippe Imparato, said the company is ready to reduce the output of gasoline and diesel cars. The COO told Automotive News Europe the production cuts could commence as early as next month. Why so soon? Because the EU's fleet emissions target will become considerably stricter from January 1, 2025.
The current fleet average target of 115.1 g/km (WLTP) will go down by approximately 19% in 2025 to 93.6 g/km. As previously reported, only Tesla and Geely were below next year's level in the first six months of 2024. It's worth noting that each automaker has its target, resulting from the average mass of its fleet. Consequently, companies that sell more SUVs have higher targets than those with smaller vehicles.
What happens when automakers fail to meet the targets? They pay fines–€95 per excess gram per car. As you can imagine, that quickly adds up when you're an automotive juggernaut such as Stellantis. Recently, Renault boss Luca de Meo said automakers active in Europe are at risk of paying €15 billion in fines, although The Financial Times quotes Barclays Bank saying it'll likely be around the €10+ billion mark.
Strong demand for EVs could allow Stellantis to build more gas cars. However, the numbers aren’t looking good so far this year. In the EU+EFTA+UK region, purely electric cars accounted for only 14.7% through September, down by 15.2% in the first nine months of 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
Stellantis will channel its car production efforts toward EVs rather than ICEs, even though the profit margins are likely still higher for gas/diesel cars. The world's fourth-largest automaker must've done the math and figured it's better to sell fewer ICEs than risk paying fines.
Car manufacturers will continue to struggle to meet fleet emissions targets, especially since the EU will lower the limit even more from 2030. Beginning with the next decade, the threshold will go down from next year's 93.6 g/km to 49.5 g/km. From 2035, automakers in Europe must reach 0 g/km, effectively putting an end to new cars powered by combustion engines. The EU will leave the door open for ICEs running on synthetic fuel or hydrogen. However, we can't imagine the refueling infrastructure will be ready only a decade from now.

Even BMW's Gas Cars Will Look Like EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/737818/bmw-gas-car-neue-klasse-ev-design/,The 'Neue Klasse' design language isn't just for electrification.,12/25/2024 8:50,"BMW's Neue Klasse concepts offered a glimpse into the future of the brand's upcoming design language. The Neue Klasse sedan debuted in 2023, and the Neue Klasse X crossover showed up earlier this year. But while many of us assumed those two concepts would preview the next era of BMW's electric vehicles, head of design Adrian van Hooydonk says that won't be the case.
In an interview with Top Gear at this year's Paris Motor Show, van Hooydonk said that every upcoming BMW will use cues from the Neue Klasse concepts—combustion cars included. Some cars will be available in both gas and electric flavors, with slightly different design elements (and proportions) to set them apart.
""The big push with EVs, these technologies, and this design language, will transfer over the entire product portfolio including our combustion vehicles,"" said van Hooydonk. ""For the customer, it won't be difficult—they will all get new modern BMWs and they can choose the drivetrain.""
That’s good news if you’re a fan of BMW’s Neue Klasse design language. Even more promising is that van Hooydonk thinks the production models will look “even better” than the concepts.
""You know how close the i3 and i8 were to their concept cars? That's what's going to happen here. If anything I like the production cars better because they're a bit more compact,"" he said.
BMW will have at least five Neue Klasse models on the road by 2029. That includes a new 3 Series—and an M3—an SUV or two, and even a sporty, high-riding coupe that we caught the company testing just a few months ago. The first of the Neue Klasse models could debut as early as next year, with the majority of which arriving in 2026 and beyond.

Porsche Taycan Sales Have Fallen Off A Cliff,https://www.motor1.com/news/737086/porsche-taycan-global-sales/,"Meanwhile, buyers are scooping up 718s before Porsche pulls the plug next year.",12/25/2024 8:50,"Porsche announced third-quarter and year-to-date sales so far in 2024, and things aren't looking good for the Taycan. The company's flagship EV is down a whopping 50 percent globally—just 14,042 have been sold from January through September. It's a contributing factor in Porsche posting an overall global sales drop of 7 percent.
The decline isn't solely related to electric power, however. The Panamera plunged 20 percent, logging 21,506 sales. The Macan, one of the company's top-selling vehicles, also recorded a 20-percent drop with 55,000 units sold. Porsche says the struggles are largely due to refreshed models arriving at dealerships, though it's worth noting the company stopped selling the gas-powered Macan in Europe, contributing to the dip in sales.
""The market environment remains challenging worldwide,"" said Detlev von Platen, sales and marketing executive board member at Porsche. ""However, with the youngest model range in the company's history and a sales structure that remains very balanced in the sales regions, we are in a robust position. Our strategy of value-oriented sales has proven its worth and will continue to form the basis of our actions in the future.""
Looking at regional numbers, things are particularly bad in China, where Porsche is down 29 percent. Sales are also down in North America, though it isn't nearly as dire at 5 percent. The company blames ""the ongoing tense economic situation"" in China and ""limited production availability"" for North America as the reasons.
Curiously, there's no mention of softening demand for EVs that's affecting virtually every automaker right now. With the company rolling out the new electric Macan and EV replacements for the 718 just around the corner—and with crosstown rivals Mercedes and BMW also struggling big time in China amid their own EV push—we suspect there are some nervous executives right now in Stuttgart.
It's not entirely doom and gloom for Porsche. The Cayenne is still the company's best-selling vehicle by a wide margin; sales are up 21 percent with 77,686 sold so far this year. We're happy to report 911 sales are also up 2 percent, at 39,744 deliveries. Ironically, the 718 Boxster and Cayman logged 18,048 sales, a year-over-year increase of 10 percent. These models will be discontinued next year.
""2024 is a particularly challenging year for us with limited product availability in some cases,"" said von Platen. ""However, we are deliberately focusing on a quality-oriented ramp-up in our new model series so that we can continue to offer our customers an unmistakable brand and product experience in the future.""

This Is An Alpine SUV Because Nothing Is Sacred Anymore,https://www.motor1.com/news/736958/alpine-a390-concept-debut/,"Et tu, Alpine?",12/25/2024 8:50,"Ah, just what we needed. Yet another SUV. I've always thought of Alpine as being the French equivalent of Lotus since they've focused on lightweight sports cars. Much like the peeps from Norfolk now have an electric SUV with the Eletre, the boys and girls based in Dieppe are introducing this–the A390_β. It's only a concept at this stage but a production version will follow next year.
Just like Ferrari is refusing to call the Purosangue an SUV, Alpine doesn't use the acronym. Instead, it's a ""sport fastback."" The sloping roofline gives the impression of an SUV that had an affair with a coupe. Because this is only a concept, the Renault-owned marque can get away with not giving the A390_β a conventional B-pillar. However, that won't be the case with the subsequent road-going model. In addition, the suicide doors won't make it to production either.
Although the concept does look more exciting than your typical SUV, logic tells us the actual vehicle people will be able to buy won’t match this level of pizzazz. There is hope, though. Alpine does promise the final car will retain around 85% of the exterior design but we'll believe it when we'll see it.
The futuristic interior is said to take after Formula 1 cars but obviously with a lot more seats. The A390 is touted as a five-seater version of the future electric A110 sports car. It's the one Alpine initially planned to develop with Lotus before the two parted ways in mid-2023.
Technical specifications are limited at this point but we do know the production model will feature three electric motors. One will sit at the front and the other two at the back, enabling all-wheel drive. It won’t be a permanent AWD setup, which suggests the front-mounted motor can be decoupled for a more tail-happy experience. Active torque vectoring is promised for a more engaging drive.
The A390 will be the second EV from Alpine, following the A290 hot hatchback. The latter is essentially a high-performance version of the reborn Renault 5. Although Alpine is coming to the United States in a couple of years, you won’t see these electric vehicles in North America. Instead, bigger SUVs are expected to get a US visa. There are also plans for an A310 coupe, a bigger four-seat sports car to take on the Porsche 911 but with an electric setup.
By the end of the decade, Alpine intends to have no fewer than seven EVs in its growing lineup. A supercar was recently confirmed and it'll either be entirely electric or will feature a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine.

This Alpine Supercar Has A Hydrogen V-6 Engine,https://insideevs.com/news/737308/alpine-supercar-hydrogen/,The Alpenglow Hy6 concept uses a twin-turbo 3.5-liter engine that makes serious horsepower.,10/14/2024 9:40,"Much like Toyota, Alpine thinks the combustion engine can be saved by making it run on hydrogen. While the Japanese automaker has been experimenting with GR Yaris and GR Corolla hot hatches with three-cylinder engines, Renault's performance division started with a four-cylinder unit. Now, it’s displaying a supercar concept with an even bigger V-6.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is an evolution of the Alpenglow Hy4 we saw a few months ago. The previous car was a running prototype of the 2022 Alpenglow, a static concept. Gone is the turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine with 340 horsepower since it's made way for a 3.5-liter V-6 with a pair of turbos. It belts out 730 hp and 568 lb-ft (770 Nm) delivered to the rear axle.
Renault's performance arm says it engineered the six-cylinder engine to run on hydrogen and linked it to a sequential transmission. The V-6 revs to 9,000 rpm and feeds on hydrogen stored in three tanks. Two are mounted in the side pods while the third one sits behind the cockpit. All three tanks are placed in ventilated compartments, and for safety reasons, don't share anything with the cabin.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is motivated by a completely new V-6 that took two years to develop. It uses an aluminum block with a dry sump and produces 211 hp per liter. The mid-mounted combustion engine is nestled in an LMP3 carbon chassis and enables the supercar to exceed 205 mph (330 km/h) with zero emissions. There is an Inconel exhaust system built into the taillights but its role is to release water vapor.
Alpine has confirmed plans to put a supercar in production but it’s unclear whether it’ll have a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine or a fully electric drivetrain. In the meantime, the French brand is gearing up to make its debut in the United States in a couple of years.
Alpine is displaying the Alpenglow Hy6 at the 2024 Paris Motor Show together with the A290 electric hot hatch as a performance version of the new Renault 5. In addition, the A390 concept is also there ahead of next year when the production model will become the company's first SUV. In addition, the limited-run A110 R Ultime special edition is also in the City of Lights this week as the brand's most expensive car ever.

"Lamborghini's EV Will Be A Big Seller, Says CEO",https://www.motor1.com/news/736579/lamborghini-ev-sales-expectations-ceo-interview/,Lamborghini's first EV won't be a sports car. But CEO Stephan Winkelmann expects it to sell as well as the Temerario.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Lamborghini is planning to release its first electric vehicle in 2028. Previewed by the Lanzador concept shown at Pebble Beach in 2023, it'll be a funky SUV-shaped 2+2 grand tourer, rather than a sports car. CEO Stephan Winkelmann predicts the EV will sell as well as the company's mainstream supercar, despite the public's diminishing interest in battery-powered cars.
Speaking with Motor1 at the launch of the Urus SE at the Nardò Technical Center in Italy, Winkelmann laid out the expected volumes of Lamborghini's lineup following the launch of its EV.
""The Revuelto is in the smallest segment, the volumes will always be the smallest,"" he told Motor1. ""And then we see Temerario and the [electric] GT car more or less on the same level. And the Urus will always be the biggest seller.""
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept at Monterey Car Week
The Temerario, released earlier this year, is Lamborghini's new entry-level supercar, replacing the hugely successful Huracán. The Italian manufacturer sold 3962 Huracáns last year, representing about 40 percent of all sales. It's probably a safe bet to assume Temerario sales will follow suit.
Winkelmann's claim on Lamborghini's EV volume is a bold prediction, then, considering the public's shifting attitude away from electric cars, even at the ultra-luxury level. But Lamborghini isn't concerned about today's demand.
""You need to think about that Lamborghini needs five years [of development], then a product cycle of at least eight years,"" Winkelmann says. ""So you always have to look into what is going to happen in the future. Because if you measure yourself on the mood of the day, you will never do anything.""
Winkelmann isn't the only one betting on Lamborghini's EV success. In a separate interview with Motor1, chief technical officer Rouven Mohr says it's only a matter of when, not if, sentiments will change. And Lamborghini won't rely on simulated gear shifts and fake engine sounds to sell cars, but rather something more.
""From our perspective, we need to go a step further,"" Mohr says. ""Only trying to imitate a combustion engine is probably the right answer for now. But we have to convince the customers that the electric driving experience is something more than you cannot have in the combustion world. Only then can you convince emotional buyers to stay electric.""

Skoda Desperately Tried To Make An Electric SUV Cool (And It Kinda Works),https://www.motor1.com/news/736710/skoda-enyaq-electric-rally-car-concept/,"Can we get an Ioniq 5 N? No, we have one at home. The Ioniq 5 N at home:",12/25/2024 8:50,"We love Skoda, don't we folks? The century-old Czech automaker always has some interesting forbidden fruit that we can only admire from across the pond. This year, leveraging its history in motorsport, Skoda built a pretty badass rally car based on one of its otherwise unassuming electric SUVs. This is the Skoda Enyaq RS Race concept.
Designed and built by Skoda Motorsport, the race division took a normal Enyaq EV and made it lower, wider, and lighter. Using biocomposite body panels incorporating flax fibers, and lightweight polycarbonate windows, the Enyaq RS Race is 661 pounds lighter than the standard Enyaq SUV. That puts it somewhere around 4,300 pounds in total.
The concept sits 2.8 inches lower than the standard Enyaq, and is 2.8 inches wider at the front and 4.6 inches wider at the rear. It ditches the production dynamic chassis control suspension for a race-ready sports suspension with individual adjustments for the spring stiffness, compression, and rebound.
Visually, the Enyaq RS Race gets an aggressive aero kit with various vents and wings. It has a new lip spoiler and a larger grille opening for better cooling up front, a sizable spoiler in the rear for added downforce, and even a functioning ​​NACA duct that channels air into the interior. Even the custom 20-inch wheels were designed to improve aerodynamics.
Two electric motors and an 82.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack power the concept, giving it 335 horsepower. Thanks to its generous weight loss, the Enyaq RS Concept will hit 62 miles per hour in less than five seconds, but it has the same 112-mph top speed as its production counterpart.
Just like a real rally car, Skoda Motorsport actually stripped the Enyaq’s interior. It now has a roll cage, a handbrake lever, an emergency fire extinguisher switch, safety foam panels, and instead of the traditional rack-and-pinion steering, this concept has linear steering with adjustable steering weight—as well as a new race-ready steering wheel. Don’t worry, Skoda kept the 13.0-inch touchscreen.
Will you ever be able to buy one of these? Unlikely. But it’s an interesting exercise in what’s possible for Skoda Motorsport moving forward. Johannes Neft, a Skoda Auto Board Member for Technical Development, says that the company is ""trialing [the biocomposite parts] in motorsport,"" and that they may use the material in ""future implementation.""
Either way, it’s awesome.

Lamborghini: Now's Not The Time For An Electric Supercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/736449/lamborghini-says-no-to-ev-supercar/,"Lamborghini's entire lineup is now hybridized. But releasing an EV sports car would still be the wrong move, says CTO Rouven Mohr.",12/25/2024 8:50,"About five years ago, Lamborghini decided to hybridize its entire lineup, forgoing the move to pure electrification. At the time, introducing pure EVs—not hybrids—seemed like the only path forward, with legislation and public pressure coming down on manufacturers. But that pressure has since reversed course, with electric car sales faltering and governments walking back aggressive EV mandates.
With demand for extravagant, high-displacement ICE cars greater than ever, it's clear Lamborghini's gamble has paid off. Chief technical officer Rouven Mohr says even now, an all-electric supercar from the brand wouldn't succeed.
""At the moment, now, the time would not be right [for an EV], at least not in a super sports car,"" Mohr told Motor1 at the Nardò Technical Center during the launch of the Urus SE. ""You have seen a lot of [electric] cars on the market that were not really successful.""
Lamborghini Terzo Millennio Concept
With its lineup fully hybridized, Lamborghini has put itself in the perfect position for success. All three of its models—the V-12-powered Revuelto, the twin-turbo Temerario, and the Urus SUV—now feature some kind of electric assistance, placing the brand in the ideal spot as competitors lag behind.
""I'm super happy with our current lineup, because with a hybridized lineup, we can live for the next decade,"" Mohr told Motor1. ""But I also believe Lamborghini needs to have the transition [to electric power], because it's only a question of time when the mindset will change.""
Lamborghini understands that time is fast approaching, which is why it plans to launch its first all-electric car in 2028. Previewed last year at Monterey with the Lanzador concept, the EV won't be a full-on supercar, but rather an SUV-shaped 2+2 grand tourer. Making it stand out amongst a sea of mostly similar-feeling EVs will be the company's biggest challenge, says Mohr.
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept
""It's about the clearness of the product, definition, staying on your brand DNA,"" he told Motor1. ""It's clear that a full electric car from Lamborghini has to have this kind of excitement factor. It's not only about maximum power, maximum acceleration. These are commodities.""
Mohr went on to say the first electric Lamborghini should have the same ""kind of roughness, a kind of excitement"" as the brand's gas-powered cars.
""You can be sure when we bring the first electric Lamborghini, we will be very careful in managing the brand's attributes,"" Mohr says. ""We are not thinking to bring another standard electric car, one megawatt of power. It's not like this. You need a differentiation.""
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept
The first (and arguably only) car that comes to mind when you think about exciting EVs is the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, thanks in part to its simulated paddle-shifted transmission. While Mohr appreciates the innovation, he doesn't think it would mesh well with the Lamborghini brand.
""I have full respect that they are addressing this point,"" Mohr says. ""For me, it's the right way to speak about emotional connection in an electric car. It's not only about acceleration, and they were the first ones that addressed it in this kind of way.
""If you asked me if [the simulated gears] are fitting to the Lamborghini brand, not so much,"" Mohr says. ""From our perspective, we need to go a step further. Only trying to imitate a combustion engine is probably the right answer for now. But we have to convince the customers that the electric driving experience is something more than you cannot have in the combustion world. Only then can you convince emotional buyers to stay electric.""
It's not clear exactly what that differentiator will be for Lamborghini. With just four years to go until the EV's launch, we won't have to wait very long to find out.

"Watch Koenigsegg, Hennessey, And Rimac CEOs Drive Each Other's Cars",https://www.motor1.com/news/736235/koenigsegg-hennessey-rimac-ceos-drive-competitors/,Mate Rimac said the Koenigsegg Jesko Attack needs 'a little less traction control.',12/25/2024 8:50,"Koenigsegg, Rimac, and Hennessey are big names in the hypercar arena. The companies make cars that push the boundaries of engineering and physics, and it’s not often we see their CEOs behind the wheel of their competitors, but Top Gear magazine assembled the three bosses and three of their cars at Sonoma Raceway to see what each thought of the other’s cars.
The three vehicles—Hennessy Venom F5 Revolution, Rimac Nevera, and Koenigsegg Jesko Attack—are pinnacles of performance, with the weakest one still making 1,600 horsepower, about 200 less than the other two.
John Hennessey was the first to go, hopping in the Koenigsegg. He called it a “little intimidating” when the coach started to dial back the traction control, saying, “A car like this should be outrageous.”
Mate Rimac then hopped into the Venom F5 for a spin, calling it a “monster engine in a go-kart. It’s crazy.” Christian von Koenigsegg then drove the Rimac, and he walked away impressed. “It’s very nice, very predictable, very easy to drive. Fun. Powerful,” he said with a smile before taking the Hennessey for a spin.
The video ends with Rimac driving Koenigsegg around the track in the Nevera as the two discuss physics. Part two should be more revealing, as the three debrief from the track session and hopefully get more candid about their competitors.

The Mercedes-AMG C63 Should've Been An EV,https://www.motor1.com/features/736240/mercedes-c63-amg-ev-opinion/,"Huge on tech and thrust, but low on charisma, the C63 can’t match its raucous predecessors. A C63 EV could’ve at least tried.",12/25/2024 8:50,"I’m loath to pile on the 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63, because it seems Mercedes already can’t sell the things. But here we are. This latest UberMerc isn’t a bad car by any objective measure, but if we search our feelings as Vader once instructed, we know it to be true: The new C63 is not a great car either.
That’s a shame because every C63 that came before was great. Never a match for the BMW M3’s lap times or the Audi RS4’s visual presence, the C63 traded on attitude. AMG picked a shade of growling Stathamesque charisma and poured it on by the bucketload.
When a C63 rolled by, it left an impression. ""Now there’s a car for a man with a scar on his face,"" you’d think. While I remember almost nothing about the last generations of M3 and Audi RS, I’ll never shake the memory of a twin-turbo C63 drifting wide up a Tennessee hairpin before swinging past the next apex. Even after it disappeared, you could hear that AMG mill wailing up the hillside for a country mile.
That’s what the C63 badge means. Why would Mercedes change the recipe?
Welcome to Kinardi Line, mouthpiece of the free world’s most curious auto writer. Home to questionable takes, quiet revelations, and shitbox worship.
We’ll never get a straight answer. But surely the decision was driven by the EU’s efficiency demands, rather than an authentic tie to the Mercedes F1 program, some cogent business case, or as it was in the days when former CEO Tobias Moers ran AMG, genuine knuckle-dragger enthusiasm.
Determined not to give us the V-8, Mercedes delivered the C63 with a compact inline-four turbo mated to some motors and batteries. By all accounts, it’s a technical masterpiece. Our writer Chris Rosales did a lovely tech breakdown of the powertrain here, and it’s funny that reading about the C63’s technology can impart a sense of awe, but the driving experience doesn’t.
This hybrid C63 will simply stomp on almost anything it locks horns with, including the older generations, but it’s woefully heavy and dull to drive in context of the car’s own history. So rather than beat this C63’s lack of emotional appeal like the dead horse it is, let’s make a different case.
Since Mercedes either can't or won't give us another V-8 brawler, the new C63 should’ve been an EV.
First, a practical argument: Mercedes moved metaphorical mountains to cram both a snorty turbo four and a plug-in hybrid system into the current C-Class.
Fallout from those packaging decisions means you just can’t fit much of anything inside this mid-size sedan. My son’s stroller, for example, won’t fit in the C63’s trunk. That’s unacceptable.
That dearth of space comes courtesy of the hybrid system’s 196-pound, 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which sits above the rear axle. It’s a small battery by modern standards, but one that deducts a huge amount of vertical trunk space. Trunk volume drops less than three cubic feet, from 12.6 to 9.8 cubes, but most of that space is lost by the trunk floor raising to accommodate the battery.
It means you can’t squeeze a folded-up stroller inside the trunk, which in turn means you have to wedge that stroller and its soggy, dirty wheels behind the driver’s seat and whoops there’s wet clay and grass over your gorgeous leather interior. To stick with a turbo-four plug-in hybrid, Mercedes sacrificed practicality on the altar of performance. But did they have to?
The Bavarians offer a counterpoint. Take the BMW i4, which sat in my driveway just a week earlier than the Benz. In M50 guise, the i4 hits 60 mph in a scant 3.3 seconds. That nearly matches the Mercedes’s frankly batshit 2.9-second time, but by the quarter-mile mark, the cars are neck and neck. The Bimmer’s a half-second behind but with the same trap speed.
While the straight-line performance of the two cars is close-but-not-equal, it’s a dead heat on the skidpad (right around 1.00 g). But, the i4 is massively more spacious on the inside, offering an airier cabin for drivers and passengers, plus seven more cubic feet of cargo volume (thanks to a fastback design), while the i4 has smaller measurements in every exterior dimension.
Cargo space isn’t the sexiest thing to hang an argument on, but we expect practicality even from our super sedans. If the C63 aims to deliver so much performance with so little emotion— weighed down by an EV’s curb weight and far more mechanical complexity—it begs the question, what if the C63 were an EV instead?
Mercedes’s EV lineup could use the excitement. Its current EV spread consists of some of the most dour and uninspired sedans in the segment. The EQE is a prime example. It’s designed both inside and outside to look sleek and inoffensive, a coated aspirin gel on wheels. If only its detached driving dynamics could dull the pain of its forgettable design.
A C63 EV could’ve jolted Mercedes’s electric lineup to life. Instead of adhering to the same low-drag mold that half of the market’s EV sedans seemingly slip from, imagine walking from the grocery store doors and seeing a C63, but this one happens to be an EV. Imagine that car’s Lucid-conquering performance, the presence of its brutish visual charm, but without having to explain what the hell is a Lucid Air?! at the neighborhood pickleball tournament.
In an era when every single Mercedes EV beyond the G-Class looks anonymous, the C63’s design still evokes the best of Mercedes-AMG’s ideals. It’s quiet but confident, elegant but menacing, and compelling in all the ways you expect the most-badass C-Class to be. The BMW i4 proves that a C-Class-shaped midsize sedan could accommodate batteries and increase livability for its passengers, as well as nailing the performance prerequisites.
Would a synthetic V-8 rumbling through the speakers sound better than the C63s anodyne soundtrack? Maybe. Or maybe not. But at least you could keep your C63’s interior from getting smeared by muddy stroller tires and, well, it couldn’t sound worse than an EQE.",Kyle Kinard
Renault Made A Hydrogen Wagon With A Rechargeable Battery,https://www.motor1.com/news/736142/renault-embleme-hydrogen-wagon-concept/,The rear-wheel-drive Emblème is a hybrid but not the usual type.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Renault wants to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2040 and all over the world just 10 years later. To get there, it's doubling down on battery-powered electric vehicles while insisting there's still a future for hydrogen cars. Dubbed as a demo car, the Emblème is actually both. Much like the new Honda CR-V e:FCEV, it combines a hydrogen fuel cell with a rechargeable battery pack.
The French marque calls it a shooting brake although some would argue it has too many doors. Body style aside, the Emblème is an aero-driven concept with a drag coefficient of only 0.25. It looks substantially different than the regular production models and we're hoping some of its design cues will rub off on road-going vehicles. The Emblème is large for a concept described as a compact car, at 189 inches (4.8 meters) long but only 59.9 inches (1.52 meters) tall, giving it a sleek profile.
Renault claims the Emblème can cover up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) ""as rapidly as an ICE vehicle."" That quote assumes two stops to juice up the 2.8-kilogram hydrogen tank, provided you'll find refueling stations considering there were roughly 1,000 globally at the end of last year. Each stop takes less than five minutes and a full tank lasts for 217 miles (350 kilometers). In town, the low-slung wagon behaves like a battery-powered EV courtesy of a 40-kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) pack.
Doing the math, a full battery charge should last for 187 miles (300 kilometers) considering that by making two stops for hydrogen, a driver can cover 434 miles (700 kilometers). The Emblème is rear-wheel drive by featuring a 215-horsepower motor mounted at the back. This wound-rotor electric motor doesn't use any rare earths.
Although it has a complex powertrain, the Emblème is not as heavy as most traditional hybrids or EVs. Renault touts a curb weight of 3,858 pounds (1,750 kilograms) after the engineers ""hunted down every superfluous kilogram."" All these efforts have been made to ensure the striking wagon is as much eco-friendly as possible. Emissions ""from the cradle to the grave"" were slashed by 90% compared to similarly sized car.
The concept car will be publicly displayed at the 2024 Paris Motor Show between October 14-20 when we're hoping to see the interior as well.

The Mercedes-AMG One PHEV Broke Its Own Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/735878/amg-one-new-nurburgring-record/,"With a lap time of 6:29.09, the AMG One beat its previous record by several seconds.",12/25/2024 8:50,"As it stands, it seems there's just one (get it?) car that can beat the Mercedes-AMG One's lap record at the Nürburgring. Yes, another AMG One. The old record established on October 28, 2022, by Mercedes‑AMG brand ambassador Maro Engel is no longer valid. That's only because he managed to improve it by several seconds.
On September 23, 2024, the DTM driver crossed the finish line in 6 minutes and 29.09 seconds. That's quite an improvement over the previous record of 6 minutes 35.18 seconds. For the sake of clarity, we're talking about the longer 12.92-mile (20.83-kilometer) configuration of the Green Hell. The AMG One is now the first street-legal production car to dip below the 6:30 mark.
Mercedes doesn't list the lap time around the shorter 12.8-mile (20.6-kilometer) layout but the hot lap from 2022 was done in 6 minutes and 30.7 seconds. As to why the three-pointed star decided to give it another whirl, it knew there was room for improvement. In the previous attempt, the track conditions were not ideal as some sections of the challenging circuit were damp.
AMG obliterated its own record during Maro Engel's third timed lap on a dry Nordschleife with 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) measured on the asphalt and 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) in the air. These were ideal conditions to beat the already impressive performance from nearly two years ago. The AMG One completed the lap at 6:56 PM.
We can't think of too many cars that could put the AMG One's lap record in jeopardy. The Aston Martin Valkyrie is one of them and maybe the upcoming McLaren W1. We're also adding the LaFerrari successor as a potential threat. We're ruling out the Red Bull RB17 because it’s a track-only machine. The same goes for the Lotus Evija X despite its 6:24 lap.
Maybe the influx of electric hypercars could rise to the challenge, but with the Nürburgring being so long, we wouldn't hold our breath. Perhaps Rimac can prove us wrong with the new Nevera R. With the Mission X, Porsche said it would conquer the 'Ring but a production version has not been announced yet.
It's hard to imagine a car that will ever beat the overall record established by the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo in 2018 when racing driver Timo Bernhard lapped the 'Ring in a mind-boggling 5 minutes and 19.5 seconds. An honorable mention goes to the electric Volkswagen ID.R driven by Romain Dumas to a 6:05 lap in 2019.

Here's An Early Look At The Electric Jeep Compass,https://www.motor1.com/news/736343/next-gen-jeep-compass-teaser/,The crossover will also be offered with hybrid and traditional combustion engines.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Despite being eight years old, the Jeep Compass is still going strong. With 84,474 units delivered in the United States through September 2024, demand is up by 18% compared to the first nine months of last year. A next-generation model is coming, but you'll have to wait. Released today, the first teaser signals the crossover's world premiere in Europe next September.
The adjacent design sketch comes along with news about the Compass going fully electric by switching to the STLA Medium platform. Don't worry–there will still be versions with combustion engines, including traditional ICE and hybrid setups. Jeep calls it the company's ""most globally available model,"" so it wants to make sure there will be a flavor of the crossover for all tastes.
The new Compass will initially hit the assembly line at Stellantis' Melfi in Italy next year before production expands to North America and other regions in 2026. In the US, the next-generation crossover will be positioned above an all-new Renegade and below the Recon as well as a mysterious ""new mainstream utility vehicle."" All three are coming by 2027, according to a product roadmap released back in June.
Meanwhile, the teaser hints at evolutionary styling with quite possibly a different take on the quarter glass. The new Compass appears to be slightly bigger judging by the distance between the C and D rear pillars. Several Stellantis products are already on the STLA Medium platform, namely the Peugeot 3008 and 5008 as well as the Opel Grandland and forthcoming next-gen Citroën C5 Aircross.
The E-3008 is the first Stellantis product on this platform, offering up to 435 miles of range on a single charge. Peugeot's electric crossover comes in front- and all-wheel-drive configurations with single- and dual-motor setups, respectively. It's offered with 73- and 98-kWh battery packs that can take 160-kW DC charging.
Expect Jeep's version to have a lot in common with its European cousins.

The Honda Prologue Surprised Me: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/735639/2024-honda-prologue-review/,The Prologue is a prime example of when badge engineering goes very right.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Rebadging is just part of the business. When two disparate companies want to share technologies or save costs, they team up to build similar vehicles with different badges, and market each one to their respective audiences. And apart from a few outliers (remember the Aston Martin Cygnet?), modern rebadging usually proves successful for both brands.
The problem with badge engineering though, is that sometimes the two products are too similar. They share virtually everything: Powertrains, technology, dynamics, etc. The only differences are the way they look and the badges on their backsides. With the Prologue, I was worried Honda’s new EV would feel too much like a Chevy—and in many ways, it does. But in this case, that's actually a good thing.
GM's Ultium platform is excellent. Underneath the Prologue's stylish sheet metal, it's basically a Chevrolet Blazer EV with a few tweaks. It has an 85.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack and two electric motors on this all-wheel-drive Elite trim, for a total output of 288 horsepower and 333 pound-feet of torque, and 273 miles of range. The single-motor, front-drive variant gets 296 miles of range.
As with most electric crossovers in this class, the Prologue is unremarkable in a straight line. Acceleration is quick and immediate, and mid-range power is decent, but it tapers off when you get up to highway speeds. Tick over to Sport mode if you want the throttle to feel a bit snappier.
Handling isn't really this Honda's forte, either. Senior Editor Chris Perkins described the steering as “gloopy,” and I agree. The steering ratio feels quick at first but doesn't add feedback as the steering angle increases. It's a strangely dull car to steer. In Sport mode, the steering effort feels just… heavier.
One thing Honda did improve over the Blazer is ride quality. With specific springs and dampers, the Prologue is phenomenally comfortable. It glides over bumps with ease and quickly smooths out broken pavement. Even with its hefty 5,273-pound curb weight and too-big 21-inch wheels on this Elite model, the Prologue rides better than some lighter ICE alternatives.
The cabin is absolutely serene. Excellent sound dampening keeps wind and tire noise at bay, which means sitting in the Prologue—even at highway speeds—is whisper quiet. Leather seats come standard on the mid-range Touring and above—and they are super comfy. And 10-way power adjustability with lumbar support is standard across the board. I had no issue quickly getting settled in the driver's seat.
The second row feels massive. There's a ton of legroom and ample headroom, more than enough for my six-foot-tall self to sit comfortably within for long periods. The Prologue has 39.4 inches of legroom and 36.7 inches of headroom on this Elite trim (the base Prologue has 38.1 inches of headroom), which aren't the best figures in the class, but competitive. The 23.8 cubic feet behind the second row are plenty capacious too, and that expands to 54.6 cubic feet with the second row folded flat.
The Prologue's 11.3-inch touchscreen and 11.0-inch digital instrument cluster run an Android-based infotainment system that's identical to what's in most modern Chevy models. That's not a bad thing. The crisp graphics, clean interface, and smartphone-quick touch responsiveness are a marked improvement over the otherwise outdated system found in Honda's ICE cars. And it still has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which works well.
There is one interesting ‘quirk’ to this system though: There’s no physical headlight switch. There’s a barely noticeable headlight toggle on the upper lefthand corner of the touchscreen, or you can do what I did and dig into five layers of screens before reaching the headlight interface. For what it’s worth, the headlights work perfectly fine on auto.
Every Prologue is equipped with Honda’s robust Sensing safety suite, which includes a forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and more. Upgrading to the OnStar Data package unlocks traffic sign recognition, and only on this Elite model do you get a rear pedestrian alert and a 360-degree overhead camera.
Starting at $48,795 for a base EX model with front-wheel drive, the Prologue isn’t the cheapest option in the segment by a long shot. That honor goes to the Ford Mustang Mach-E at $42,985 (and it has standard rear-wheel drive). For the Prologue Elite, prepare to dish out at least $59,295 before options. The $455 Sonic Gray Pearl brings the as-tested price to $59,750.
That’s a pretty penny to pay for a badge-engineered Honda. Thankfully, GM’s Ultium platform makes the Prologue an excellent proposition thanks to its serene ride, sumptuous cabin, and superb powertrain. And for my money, it looks better than the Blazer.

AMG Boss Is Confident V-8 Buyers Will Switch To Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/735838/amg-confident-v8-buyers-switch-ev/,"The CEO says people have bought cars with eight cylinders not just for the engine, but also the technology.",12/25/2024 8:50,"After learning that AMG buyers will embrace four-cylinder hybrids like smartphones, the man in charge of Mercedes' performance division follows up with an equally controversial statement. Speaking with Britain's Autocar magazine, AMG CEO Michael Schiebe was highly confident that buyers will have no problems switching from a big ol' V-8 engine to electric.
""Customers who came to the brand because of the V-8 did not come because they just wanted to have a big engine. They came because they loved the technology that we put into the car. So when it comes to electric driving, I'm pretty sure they will jump into that new technology because it will be the latest and greatest that you can get.""
The gist of this statement is that AMG wants us to believe Affalterbach's clientele consists of people who prioritize technology. If the latest developments don't have a combustion engine, customers will apparently transition to EVs. Sooner or later, the ""one man, one engine philosophy"" will come to an end, and it looks as though Schiebe believes people won't hesitate to embrace EVs as long as it has the newest tech.
But the V-8 engine isn't dying anytime soon. AMG has promised it still has new eight-cylinder models in the works. A recent spy video indicates the CLE63 could be the next in line to get the V-8 treatment. Reports state that the top-tier CLE was supposed to have a downsized electrified powertrain but weak demand for the C63 has prompted AMG to change the engine late in the development stage.
Although exact sales figures for the C63 are not available, massive discounts in Germany indicate it's not exactly popular. The C63 is not the only AMG to lose its V-8 since the GLC63 has also dropped the twin-turbo 4.0-liter unit. In addition, Mercedes has already announced the next E63 won't have eight cylinders.
Referring to the plug-in hybrid 2.0-liter setup in a previous interview, Schiebe admitted some AMG customers ""take time to really be excited for the technology."" He went on to say that ""it's important to be open-minded when it comes to technology."" Looking further back, Schiebe defended the company's decision to put a four-banger in the C63 by saying its plug-in hybrid setup is ""very, very progressive.""
In AMG's defense, it is putting money where its mouth is. Not only has it launched several high-performance PHEVs, but it's also developing a bespoke electric car platform. The AMG.EA architecture has been several years in the making and Autocar understands a purely electric supercar is in the works. It'll apparently take after last year's Vision One-Eleven concept and should serve as a spiritual successor to the quad-motor 2013 SLS AMG Electric Drive.
AMG has already ruled out doing another F1-powered hypercar to follow up on the One because of increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Lower in the vast Mercedes lineup, there are still plenty of six- and eight-cylinder models, and even a massive V-12 in the Maybach S-Class.
Generally speaking, there's still time to buy a car with the right amount of cylinders but there are fewer and fewer options.

Caterham's Electric Sports Car Will Get Its Power From An Unlikely Source,https://www.motor1.com/news/735830/yamaha-power-caterham-sports-car/,The rear-wheel-drive electric coupe will fight the next Porsche Cayman.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Remember the Caterham Project V? The electric concept car debuted last year at the Goodwood Festival of Speed with an impressively low curb weight of 2,623 pounds. But it was more than just a one-and-done exercise; The niche British brand has real plans to launch a production model. And now we know who will power the electric coupe: Yamaha
The concept is now evolving into a prototype engineered by Japanese firm Tokyo R&D. It will be powered by a Yamaha electric powertrain, and should be completed by the middle of next year, with series production expected to commence at some point in 2026. Caterham doesn't go into details about Yamaha's electric motor, but the original Project V concept was rear-wheel drive with 268 horsepower on tap.
The show car from Goodwood had a 2+1 layout but an optional 2+2 configuration was mentioned. Caterham touted a 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and a top speed of 143 mph. The coupe's 55.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery had enough juice for 249 miles in the optimistic WLTP cycle. The concept supported DC charging at 150 kilowatts for a 20% to 80% charge in around 15 minutes.
Because concepts are typically diamonds in the rough, Caterham borrowed bits and pieces from other cars to speed up the Project V's development without compromising quality. Examples include Maserati seats and the Audi TT's door aperture. Some readily available parts will be installed in the road-going model to cut costs.
Even though it never built its own car, Yamaha is no stranger to the automotive industry. It teased us with a Miata rival in the mid-2010s that never went into production. Going further back, it helped Toyota develop the 2000GT in the 1960s before engineering and manufacturing Ford's V-6 SHO and V-8 SHO.
Perhaps the most well-known effort in the car world was Yamaha’s involvement in the Lexus LFA and its naturally aspirated V-10. The list goes on with a V-8 for Volvo as well as four-cylinder engines for the Toyota Celica, MR2, and the Lotus Elise. There was also the pint-sized Motiv concept and the aborted 1992 OX99-11 supercar that was supposed to go into production a couple of years later with a roaring V-12.
Yamaha hasn't completely abandoned ICE technology. Recent efforts have included a golf cart and a buggy modified to run on a hydrogen-burning combustion engine.

Alpine Is Working On A New Supercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/735741/alpine-new-electric-supercar-confirmed/,It’s probably going to be electric.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Even though we don't get the Alpine brand in America, we can still fawn over the no-nonsense A110 sports car from abroad. The Porsche Cayman competitor makes 252 horsepower and weighs a scant 2,429 pounds—and it sounds like an absolute blast to drive. But Alpine is working on something even more powerful, the problem is, it probably won't have the same lightweight qualities as its little brother.
According to Autocar, Alpine is opening a new research and development facility at its Viry-Chatillon Formula 1 engine production site dubbed ""Hypertech Alpine."" The R&D base will be home to all things electric for the Alpine brand moving forward, including a new performance car currently referred to as the ""Future Alpine Supercar."" Clever.
""Creating this Hypertech Alpine center is key to Alpine's development strategy and, more broadly, to the group's innovation strategy,"" said Alpine CEO Philippe Krief. ""It is a turning point in the history of the Viry-Châtillon site, which will ensure the continuity of a savoir-faire and the inclusion of its rare skills in the group's ambitious future while strengthening Alpine's position as an 'innovation garage.'""
The yet-to-be-named vehicle will be built alongside an electric A110 and reportedly use Alpine's new future solid-state battery packs designed for ""extreme operating conditions for supercar-type applications."" It will also adopt ultra-efficient electric motors jointly developed with Ampere—Renault's new EV and software sub-brand.
Visually, the new supercar should look similar to the Alpenglow Hy4 hypercar concept the company debuted back in May. Alpine design chief Antony Villain told Autocar that the concept was developed with a production car ""in mind"".
It should be noted, though, that Alpine hasn’t outright confirmed that its next performance vehicle will be electric. All signs simply point to battery power. With a new A110 EV on the way and the brand’s breakthroughs in battery and electric motor technology, Alpine will likely want to showcase that technology in an all-electric supercar.
But who knows, maybe one of those leftover Formula 1 engines finds its way underhood. It’s not like they’ll need them after 2025 anyway.

No One Is Buying The New Fiat 500,https://www.motor1.com/news/735737/fiat-500-production-stopped/,Stellantis has halted production of the tiny city car until November 1 over poor demand.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Things aren't looking great for Stellantis. Sales for the company's Dodge and Jeep brands in America are cratering, and its overseas brands aren't doing much better. Adding to the bad news, Stellantis announced today it will extend its suspension of production for the all-electric Fiat 500 until November 1 over low demand.
The company originally stopped production of the 500 on September 12, planning to idle the car's Mirafiori, Italy plant for four weeks. Now, that stoppage has been extended by another three weeks.
The decision, Reuters reports, comes alongside a statement given to trade unions claiming the electric car market in Europe is ""in deep trouble.""
Despite the production halt, the Fiat 500 is far from dead. Stellantis plans to invest over $110 million into the car in the next two years, funding the development of a gas-powered hybrid version that'll arrive next year, reversing course on a purely electric lineup to account for waning demand.
For some context, Stellantis sold just 470 Fiat 500s in America in the first half of 2024. In 2012—its best year of sales—the company moved 46,999 examples of the last-gen 500. Even in 2020, after the car had been discontinued for North America, Stellantis still managed to sell 674 units.
The lack of demand makes sense, at least for the US. The 500e gets just 149 miles of range and starts at $34,095. It doesn't take a degree in mathematics to realize those numbers don't make sense for American car buyers. For the same price, you can buy an electric Hyundai Kona with way more space and 120 miles of extra range. The Fiat just isn't competitive.
Adding a gas-powered trim is a step in the right direction, but it might be too little, too late for Stellantis, judging by all the other bad news coming from the brand lately. Hopefully the company finds its way out of the hole it's dug for itself.

Volvo Still Wants Europe To Ban Sales Of New Gas Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/735667/volvo-wants-new-gas-car-ban/,The CEO argues that going purely electric is the best way to cut emissions.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Volvo was among the first legacy automakers to announce the gradual demise of its combustion engines. As early as the beginning of 2021, it promised to go purely electric by the end of the decade. That's not happening anymore, but the Swedes insist Europe should still ban sales of new cars with gas engines by 2035.
Bloomberg got a hold of a declaration signed by Volvo and 49 other companies urging the European Union not to change the target. According to CEO Jim Rowan, the most efficient measure the automotive industry can take to reduce emissions on the continent is to ban sales of new ICE cars: ""Electrification is the single biggest action our industry can take to cut its carbon footprint.""
Volvo is not the only automaker on that shared declaration as Rivian also wants the EU to stick to its plan of abolishing gas and diesel cars by the middle of the next decade. Bloomberg points out other automakers refused to sign the declaration but other big names outside of the car manufacturing business did, including Uber and Ikea. Tesla isn't mentioned in the report, even though just like Rivian, it only sells EVs.
It's important to mention there's an asterisk next to that ban. The European Commission wants automakers to stop selling cars that generate harmful emissions, so ICE engines are not banned per se. In theory, that leaves the door open for new vehicles powered by combustion engines running on synthetic fuel or even hydrogen. Germany demanded this exemption, and the EC has pledged to elaborate a legal route for cars with combustion engines that run on carbon-neutral fuels to stick around after 2034.
In the meantime, Volvo has killed one important type of combustion engine and has promised to never bring it back. In late March, the last diesel car rolled off the assembly line. By 2030, plug-in hybrids with gasoline engines and purely electric vehicles are projected to account for 90-100% of total sales.
Six years from now, the Geely-owned brand believes only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models"" are still going to be around. PHEVs and EVs already represented 48% of shipments in the second quarter of the year, with Volvo estimating 50-60% for 2025.
At the beginning of the year, Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said the 2035 ban could be delayed. Earlier this month, Italy's Minister of the Environment and Energy Security declared ""the ban must be changed"" as the ""ideological vision"" has failed. Gilberto Pichetto Fratin added the proposed ban is ""absurd"" and that Europe ""needs a pragmatic vision."" His sentiments are echoed by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she believes the ban is ""self-destructive.""
Whatever happens in Europe, it will have global ramifications since the biggest players in the automotive industry develop and build cars on the continent. If a certain brand won't be allowed to sell its gas car from 2035, that company might not achieve the necessary economies of scale and could kill that ICE model globally.

VW ID. Buzz Gets A Spartan Base Model In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/735650/vw-id-buzz-base-model/,The electric minivan has steelies and unpainted bumpers.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Although America is only now getting the ID.Buzz, Volkswagen has been selling its retro electric minivan in Europe for several years. In a bid to make the zero-emission family hauler more attainable, there's a new Freestyle flavor serving as the entry-level trim. As you can see from images we took from the German configurator, you'll have to make some serious concessions.
The spartan-spec ID.Buzz has 18-inch steel wheels with 235/60 R18 front and 255/55 R18 rear tires. That reminds me of another electric vehicle from the VW Group built on the same MEB platform with even larger steelies. A few months ago, I was surprised to see the Audi Q4 E-Tron has a 19-inch set with glorious hubcaps. If want alloys, VW has a couple of 19-inch sets that cost around €2,500 ($2,800) more.
This Candy White color is the only one offered at no extra cost, but an optional metallic Moon Silver can be had for an additional €1,035 ($1,150). Regardless of choice, the ID.Buzz Freestyle comes with unpainted bumpers that look straight out of the 1980s. Speaking of things no longer in fashion, VW throws in those side decals for free.
The interior is predictably dreary as well with basic-looking cloth seats that look like leftovers from a base Golf Mk4. You still get that giant tablet with a 12.9-inch display and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Other goodies included as standard vary from height-adjustable front seats to dual-zone automatic climate control.
While America only gets the stretched configuration, Europeans can buy the ID. Buzz with a standard wheelbase. That's what we have here, hosting a 59-kWh battery pack between the two axles. The juice is used by a rear electric motor that produces 170 horsepower, roughly half of what you get in the sporty GTX trim level.
With 229 pound-feet of instant torque, the poor man's ID. Buzz in Europe takes 10.7 seconds to reach 62 mph and won’t go any faster than 90 mph. It's not exactly quick but that’s to be expected given a curb weight of nearly 5,300 pounds and only a single-motor setup. Once you're out of energy, it takes 24 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% using DC.
At €49,997, the Freestyle undercuts the previous base trim level (Pure) by a little over €4,000. If we do the conversion, it works out to a base price of $55,663. That makes it nearly $6,000 cheaper than the much nicer base ID.Buzz available in the US. However, it's not a fair comparison seeing as how Germans pay 19% value-added tax (VAT).
The launch of a sub-€50,000 ID. Buzz in Germany closely follows the introduction of a sub-€30,000 ID.3, the not-for-America compact electric hatchback. VW seems to be making more efforts to sell EVs in a cooling European market by launching additional attainable versions. It's probably worried about meeting fleet emissions targets, which will get even stricter in 2025, putting automakers at risk of paying massive fines if they exceed a certain threshold.

Lotus Tells Us Why the Theory 1 Concept Is So Important,https://www.motor1.com/features/735602/lotus-theory1-concept-supercar-up-close-look/,"'You can't ignore [the past], because one of the most important things we have is our heritage.'",12/25/2024 8:50,"Most concept cars promise to run on unicorn farts, pump out 9,000 horsepower, deliver nano-second 0-60 mph times, and even cook your dinner if you ask nicely. We’ve often thought, ""What a nice concept, it’ll never happen."" They’re show-stoppers meant to highlight something that could possibly, maybe appear one day on a family sedan. And while they’re a neat distraction from the mundanities of the 9-5, they ultimately mean very little.
The Lotus Theory 1 is not that. This concept car is an actual sign of things to come. It has toys on board that actually work, and features that could appear on future cars. When it comes to Lotus, the future is sprinkled with a dash of the past.
Ben Payne, Lotus Group Design Vice President, was in London to talk us through the company’s new baby. Payne is all too aware of how the past needs to be respected.
""You can't ignore [the past], because one of the most important things we have is our heritage. Ignore that at your peril. It's extremely important we don't just do something that looks beautiful. It needs to have some genuine story behind it—how we can explain why it does certain things, or why it looks that way,"" Payne said.
Of course, the Theory 1 is a tech-fest, but it still nods to one of Lotus’s best-known icons: the Esprit.
""It isn't a pastiche, no. For us in the creative team it was more about taking the spirit of the Esprit and imagining what that looked like 50 years ago,"" he said.
There are nods to the Esprit all over the Theory 1—from the sheer wedginess of it, to lines along its flanks, and more. Looking back to inform the future, it seems, is a luxury Payne and his team seem to enjoy rather than endure. The Lotus back catalog is full of hits, why not use some of them as inspiration? Though here, if a customer, fan, or… whoever spots that some of the old stuff is present in the mix that’s seen as an objective win. Seeing an Emeya alongside, though, shows that it’s very much an evolution of the current design direction. The present isn’t to be ignored either.
It’s fair to say that delving into the firm’s past is, perhaps, wise. The firm’s EV offerings, the Eletre SUV and Emeya sedan, have received mixed reactions. Lotus purists, the devotees of lightness, affordability, and simplicity, have been vocal online about their heft, tech, and anything else they can pick holes in. The 'simplify and add lightness' quote of old is bandied around with nauseating frequency, but the Lotus that the faithful are used to didn’t come with huge batteries, 900 hp, or (in most cases) rear seats.
Today’s Lotus, or at least the Lotus that built Theory 1, is taking a different approach:
""The subject of weight, of course, is something everyone comes back to most. You have to understand that if that's what people think about your brand, your brand is what other people say—not what you say. So it's a core part of it—we have to deliver an efficiency in terms of a balance of weight, performance, and practicality, and that's really the equation with EV[s].""
Payne explains that the lightness craved by many online can happen, but at a cost of either power, or range—finding the balance of what’s right for the brand, its direction, and customers is key. Getting it right requires, according to Payne, a new take on simplifying and adding lightness.
""Start from nothing, add the minimum. Just start from nothing, and only add what you need to see where you get to,"" Payne said.
EVs, of course, come in all shapes and sizes, but for Lotus to offer one with 1,000 metric horsepower, a target weight under 3,500 pounds, and 250 miles of range, you need to start with some chunky kit—a large battery (in this case 70.0-kilowatt-hours), motors capable of delivering serious grunt, a structure that’ll keep occupants safe (and warm), and the level of tech you’d expect from a supercar.
The Theory 1 isn’t a family car, it’s not dripping in plushness, and it’s not the sort of thing you can put a dog in the back of—largely because the back is full of pushrod suspension bits, EV running gears, and the sort of engineering solutions that will make your inner engineer contort with glee. It’s a supercar through and through.
Its seats are shaped into its carbon tub—one in the middle for the driver, and two set back on either side for their mates. The pedals and steering wheel move toward the driver silently when it’s time to go. Rather than sit on bare carbon, padding is strategically positioned, but it’s not ‘just’ padding. It’s active. The Theory 1 comes with haptic fabric.
Developed by a company called MotorSkins, the fabric can react to various inputs and change its shape depending on what you need. For example, if you change the car’s drive mode the seat will reconfigure its bolsters. If Theory 1’s myriad safety systems (it comes with plenty of that—even the same active LiDAR as the Eletre and Emeya) detect a car in your blind spot, it can theoretically give you a tap on the shoulder.
Lotus can even build buttons into the car that appear at first as flat fabric, but spring to life when needed—when you want to take a call, for example. It works with layers of fabric and air channels, which keeps it light, keeping extra tech to the minimum that Payne was talking about.
Similarly, the headrests aren’t big slabs of foam, but another technology that’s yet to be seen on a road car: 3D printed plastic. You might recognize the form of it if you’re into sneakers—the company that made it, Carbon, has been working with Adidas for years. Its 3D printed soles are springy, comfy, and look awesome. Why not use that tech as a light, aesthetically pleasing headrest? There’s even room for a set of KEF speakers in each seat so everyone can listen to their own concert as you glide along.
Smart toys are bolstered with smart materials—its glass is recycled, as is the carbon fiber that makes up its tub, and there’s a good dose of cellulose composites in its bodywork, too. The Lotus of old was a pioneer in the material space, and it looks like the Lotus of the future is carrying on with tradition.
While there have been some interested parties, Lotus isn’t going to build the Theory 1. You’ll see elements of it in future cars. It didn’t appear out of thin air, in fact, it’s been hiding out of sight for a while.
""The entire process took about two years,"" said Payne, ""some of our workstreams started without a car in mind. We were looking at material explorations, next-gen lighting modules, and that kind of stuff."" From there, a concept bloomed.
With a mix of old Lotus and new, the faithful should—hopefully—be happy with where things are pointing. Payne notes that as time goes on, and new cars are launched, things may become a little more familiar than the current EV lineup:
""We listen to the feedback, to what people say. We can't ignore the customer—ever. We're an agile enough company to listen to what people say,"" explained Payne, ""As we start making smaller vehicles, they will, from their physicality, become more as people may remember the core of the brand. And I think this is very much a brand statement the future is very much going to embrace.""",Alex Goy
Chevy: We're Not Dumb Enough To Rush The Corvette Onto The EV Bandwagon,https://www.motor1.com/news/735611/chevrolet-not-making-electric-corvette-just-because/,Chief Engineer Tony Roma said there has to be a need—and a want.,12/25/2024 8:50,"The E-Ray is Chevrolet's first electrified Corvette. Soon, a Corvette Zora will debut with what we’re confident will be a high-powered hybrid powertrain. But the question remains: Will the Corvette ever go fully electric? As far as Chevy is concerned, not unless the company sees a real need.
In an interview with CBS News, Corvette's new Chief Engineer, Tony Roma, said an electric Corvette would only make sense if it improved the Corvette's performance, or if customers demanded it. And as of right now, neither of those things appear to be true.
""We talk about this a lot. I talk about this with enthusiasts, my friends, other engineers,"" said Roma. ""We’re not going to apply electrification just for the sake of it. We don’t put technology on for technology’s sake, so it kind of has to earn its way in. It has to make the car better in some way that our customers are gonna respond to.""
CEO Mary Barra seconded that statement. She told CBS News: ""We’ll be guided by the consumer, but the plans we have will get us there.""
Even with EV enthusiasm waning, Chevrolet still wants its lineup to be fully electric by 2035. That would almost certainly include a battery-powered Corvette—but that’s still over 10 years off. But while a Corvette EV isn’t on the table yet, the high-powered Zora hybrid should be here as early as next year.
Spy photos and videos show the new hybrid Corvette Zora testing on the Nurburgring. The prototypes in question were spotted with yellow high-voltage stickers (mandatory on the ‘Ring for battery-powered vehicles) and design elements similar to the E-Ray. If we’re lucky, it could have more than 1,200 horsepower.

Toyota Drops Meaningless Name For Plug-In Hybrids,https://www.motor1.com/news/735224/toyota-drops-prime-name/,"The ""Prime"" nameplate is dead. From now on, Toyota will just call them plug-in hybrids. As it should be.",12/25/2024 8:50,"""Prime"" is dead. Toyota announced on Thursday that its naming scheme for plug-in hybrid trims of the RAV4 and Prius has been dropped. Instead, the cars will be called the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. As it should be.
The Prime name first appeared in 2017 with the introduction of the Prius Prime, based on the then-new fourth-generation Prius. The first RAV4 Prime appeared in 2019, making headlines with its combined 302 horsepower and claimed 5.5-second 0-60 time.
""The switch to the RAV4 Plug-in name is intended to help consumers more easily identify the powertrain choices among RAV4 models,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""In addition to the model naming change, the Toyota logo on the front and rear of the vehicle will no longer have a blue “halo” within.""
The Prime name might've sounded cool, but it made things tough for normal shoppers who just wanted to know what they were getting. This switch will make it far easier for people to understand the differences in powertrain offerings without having to load up Google on their phones.
Aside from the badging switch-up, the RAV4 Plug-In continues into 2025 with no changes. That means standard all-wheel drive, an estimated 42 miles of all-electric range, and a combined 38 mpg when in hybrid mode.
The 2025 Prius Plug-in Hybrid continues similarly, with the same 220 hp as last year's Prime model, 44 miles of electric driving range, and up to 52 mpg combined, depending on wheel size.

Nissan's Nismo Won't Go Fully Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/734968/nissan-nismo-fully-electric/,Chaotic EV growth has forced Nissan's performance brand to adjust.,12/25/2024 8:50,"If you've been worried that Nissan's high-performance Nismo division will be going fully electric, we have some good news. In a recent interview, Pierre Loing, Nissan's global product boss, said, ""Nismo has no specific target to go electric only.""
Loing told Top Gear magazine that EV growth has been chaotic, and ""our role as a manufacturer is to adjust."" The company is focusing on its E-Power powertrain, which uses the gasoline engine as a battery generator. Nissan launched the Qashqai E-Power in 2022, the first model to feature the new setup and any Nismo plans depend on the specific model. Over half of the Qashqai's sold in Europe have E-Power.
Nissan knows a car like the GT-R can command a far higher price for a Nismo offering than a model like the Ariya. Loing admits the Ariya isn't a cheap EV, so the price ceiling can't reach ""a super high level,"" which ultimately depends on the model. A Nismo package has to fit the product, and any expansion will need strong sales to justify its existence.
Automakers across the board are reconsidering their electric vehicle plans in the face of inconsistent growth. Many are tempering their ambitious roadmaps, pushing back EV launches while focusing on growing their hybrid lineups. It indicates how quickly consumer trends can change and how nimble automakers have had to adjust.
Loing said that if you'd asked him about the company's EV plans a few years ago, he would have ""given a different answer."" Hopefully, the next few years won't force the automaker to set a new timeline to fully electrify the Nismo line.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Gets Even Driftier,https://www.motor1.com/news/734891/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n/,A configurable Drift Mode and a handful of other upgrades join the lineup for 2025.,12/25/2024 8:50,"It’s been a little over a year since Hyundai took the wraps off the Ioniq 5 N. The high-performance electric crossover is entering the 2025 model year at home in South Korea with a surprisingly large number of changes. There aren't any styling tweaks since most of the work revolved around making the software better to deliver a more engaging drive.
The N Drift Optimizer that helps the Ioniq 5 N go sideways can now be configured by choosing from one of the 10 available levels of assistance. Dial it all the way up to level 10 (Pro mode) and the hot EV becomes tail-happy by minimizing the intervention of the stability control system so that drivers can ""drift more freely."" In addition, the system can now better detect suitable drift conditions, which Hyundai presumes will be only on a race track.
There's also something called Downshift Memory. Intended for track use, the function ""allows the vehicle to store commands without shifting and shift when the vehicle reaches the allowable engine revs (rpm) for downshifting."" We’ll remind you the old Kona N had a downshift memory logic system that prevented downshifting at high rpms.
Elsewhere, the artificial engine sound is automatically turned on when the launch control function is triggered. This N Active Sound+ simulates the noise of a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine as found in the Elantra N.
The 2025 Ioniq 5 N for Korea gets automatic high beams with glare-free functionality. There's also a Walk-Away Lock system that automatically locks the doors when the driver walks a certain distance away from the car. The model year change brings Vehicle to Load (V2L) so that you can use the battery's stored energy to power external devices.
Rounding off the list of novelties are the second-row safety windows and haptic warning for the steering wheel. The latter begins to vibrate to warn the driver whenever the assist systems detect a hazard.
In Korea, the 2025 Ioniq 5 N costs the equivalent of $57,600 after factoring in incentives. Meanwhile, Hyundai is putting the finishing touches on its sedan equivalent, the Ioniq 6 N.

Volvo's EVs Won't Look Like An 'Apple Mouse',https://www.motor1.com/news/734747/volvo-against-blob-car-designs/,It won't compromise style and comfort for the sake of ultra-efficient shapes.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Some automakers have been criticized for going overboard with aerodynamic efficiency, making their electric vehicles look like blobs. We're looking at you, Mercedes. The more slippery the shape is, the greater the distance the EV can cover. But Volvo thinks there's a limit to the amount of attention given to drag coefficiency when engineering a new model.
Speaking with the Australian magazine Drive, Volvo's Senior Manager of Exterior Design Florian Mockenhaupt said future Volvos will benefit from improved aerodynamics but cautioned that focusing primarily on aero efficiency ultimately hurts styling as well as practicality:
""It's not actually so much the aesthetics, but making a car that looks like an Apple mouse comes with a lot of other compromises. We know that our customers worship comfort, for example, very much.""
Mockenhaupt says Volvo will pursue to make its cars sleeker while keeping the design language cohesive across the lineup. Next-gen models will logically look more modern but won't be a total departure from current cars since he believes people shopping in the luxury segment prefer consistency. He argues it's a different story among mainstream automakers as some brands have cars that look entirely different while sitting next to each other in the showroom.
Mockenhaupt pledges Volvo will avoid embracing the ""same sausage, different length"" strategy some of the German competitors are still doing in 2024. There is one model in the company's lineup that's not quite like the others, primarily because it's not actually a Volvo. Yes, the EM90, a rebadged minivan that started in life as the Zeekr 009. However, its impact on Volvo's overall image is limited since the posh family hauler is only sold in China.
As reported by Automotive News, Volvo CEO Jim Rowan and Chief Commercial Officer Bjorn Annwall told dealers in the US that 10 next-gen cars or updated models will be launched within the next 24 months. Two of them will be the EX60 crossover and ES90 sedan, both of which will be EVs, plus a plug-in hybrid with a long range. These will join the recently launched EX90 and a second facelift for the XC90.
For global markets, Volvo intends to launch a next-gen car and a facelifted model annually for the next eight years. Despite initially saying it would go electric-only by 2030, the Geely-owned company is now hoping that plug-in hybrids and EVs will account for 90-100% of sales by the end of the decade.

The Electronics Company Sharp Wants To Sell Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/734364/sharp-wants-sell-cars-by-2030/,This electric minivan has solar panels and a 65-inch display.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Just when you thought the automotive industry couldn't possibly get more crowded, another player wants to enter the game. To make it happen, TV maker Sharp intends to work with Foxconn, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer. It's better known as one of the companies that produces the iPhone. Their first joint effort is this. Say hello to the cute LDK+.
It's an EV with an adorably boxy shape and some neat features inside and out. The people-mover started in life as Foxconn's Model C crossover before being transformed for minivan duty. Sharp made the most of that massive roof by fitting solar panels to juice up the battery or power your home. There's a separate ""storage battery” to further take advantage of bidirectional charging by serving as an energy supply in case of emergencies such as a power outage caused by a natural phenomenon.
The cavernous interior is big enough to accommodate a massive 65-inch screen and rear seats that swivel. Sharp says the LDK+ uses artificial intelligence that gathers information from home appliances to adjust the AC and screen brightness. That massive display mounted at the back is not just for play as it can be used for a mobile office.
Technical specifications remain shrouded in mystery at this point. However, we do know the 2021 concept has since evolved into a production model that's already on sale in Taiwan as the Foxtron Model C. If you're unfamiliar with the name, Foxtron is a joint venture between Luxgen's parent company Yulon and Foxconn.
The road-going SUV has 231 horsepower, 250 pound-feet of torque, and 314 miles of range, albeit in the overly optimistic New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) cycle. The EV is 184.8 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 64 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 115 inches. That said, Sharp's electric minivan has different proportions. As for weight, the Foxtron Model C tips the scales at around 4,300 pounds.
Automotive News spoke with a Sharp official about the company’s ambitions to enter the automotive realm. Kazuma Naito, software development manager at Sharp’s Next Innovation branch, said the objective is to start selling cars by 2030. He admitted that the timeframe is currently a ""loose goal.""
With Foxconn owning a 66% controlling stake in Sharp, it's no surprise the two will collaborate again to bring EVs to the market by the decade's end. In the first phase, Sharp wants to sell electric cars at home in Japan, built domestically or somewhere else by Foxconn, potentially in China.
Sharp won't be the only tech giant from the Land of the Rising Sun to enter the car business in recent years. Sony has teamed up with Honda to launch an automotive joint venture called Sony Honda Mobility to bring the Afeela electric sedan to the market in 2025. An SUV is set to follow in 2027, with a cheaper compact model believed to debut in 2028 at the earliest.
Speaking of tech companies making cars, the long-rumored Apple Car was canceled back in February. That's despite an investment of more than $10 billion (yes, with a ""b"") over a decade, according to a recent report from The New York Times.

"The 2025 Rivian R1S Is Better, but So Is Its Competition",https://www.motor1.com/reviews/733727/2025-rivian-r1s-first-drive/,"The R1S is still a great SUV, but tougher competition has exposed more of its weak points.",12/25/2024 8:50,"Rivian’s R1S is essentially all-new for 2025, but you’d be forgiven for not knowing that by looking at it. It’s got new batteries, new motors, new software, and even new wiring, but the sheet metal is virtually untouched—it’s still the same friendly two-box design from 2022.
What has changed is the R1S’s competition. When it was new, the R1S was basically the only way to get an electrified (standard) three-row SUV; Now, it competes directly against an ever-growing segment of vehicles from EV upstarts and legacy manufacturers, and it makes the R1S a tougher sell. For 2025, the R1S now costs $75,900, which means a base model is priced roughly the same as a top-of-the-line Kia EV9 GT-Line, one of its biggest competitors.
Buyers of the base model get the same power as before: boatloads. The standard dual-motor drivetrain pumps out a whopping 533 horsepower and 615 pound-feet of torque, vastly more than the 379-horsepower EV9. It only gets faster from there. Upgrade to the Performance package ($5,000, equipped on my test vehicle) and the same pair of motors produce 665 hp and 829 lb-ft.
Rivian also offers a tri-motor with 850 hp and a quad-motor version with 1,025 hp, but the quad-motor R1Ss won’t hit the streets until next year. Those are promised to pull ten-second quarter miles and hit 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. For my purposes, 665 horsepower was plenty.
For supplying juice to those in-house-designed motors, Rivian offers three battery sizes: A 92.0-kilowatt-hour Standard, a 109.0-kilowatt-hour Large, and a 141.0-kilowatt-hour Max. The battery chemistries and actual capacities are different from the previous R1S, but that’s primarily to help Rivian turn a profit, not to radically change the driving experience of the car.
As far as things buyers will notice, the range varies from a quite-good 258 miles to an outstanding 410 miles, depending on the battery and vehicle specification chosen. My test vehicle was a Dual Max, which offers the full 410 miles of range; This handily bests the Tesla Model X’s 335 miles and the EV9’s 304 miles. Replenishing times are also excellent, with Large and Max packs offering a 220-kilowatt maximum charging rate on DC fast-chargers, translating to 140 miles of range in just 20 minutes.
Buyers should note that price climbs quickly with larger, faster batteries, though. The R1S Dual Max starts at $89,900, but as-tested, the R1S I drove cost $100,950—more than a much-faster Model X Plaid and rapidly approaching the sticker on a Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV ($105,550).
This is where comparison shopping the R1S starts to show weaknesses. For buyers who value off-road ability, the R1S is unrivaled by any EV short of the Hummer—36 inches of wade depth, 15 inches of ground clearance, 35.8 degrees of approach angle. But on the road, it isn’t quite a premium ride. Despite updated and improved suspension, the R1S rides like an old-school SUV than a modern-day luxury EV. In ""normal,"" it feels a bit too stiff on less-maintained b-roads. In “soft”, it rides like its rebound rate doesn’t quite match its compression rate. And potholes at speed lead to more cabin vibration than its road-focused electric competition.
The 2025 model is updated to a hydraulic anti-roll system, which works excellently, as body lean in cornering is well-managed. The steering is sharp, and the Dual Max stayed well-planted on full-throttle pulls. Still, because of the suspension tuning, if I were choosing a vehicle for a long road trip I’d be more likely to eye an EV9 or an EQS for overall ride comfort.
Inside the cabin, I appreciated the new software written for the 15.6-inch infotainment screen and 12.3-inch driver gauge cluster. Response times are excellent, and graphics for changing drive modes and entering menus are crisply animated. The electric-dimming roof-spanning skylight equipped on my Dual Max was gorgeous and worked well, when dimmed, at keeping most of the heat out of the interior despite 100+ F temps outside. The synthetic leather upholstery feels nice enough, the new in-house premium audio system blasts tunes with clarity, and the woodgrain trim is a thoughtful touch. It’s pleasant when parked.
Actually driving and interacting with the R1S’s cabin, however, is a different story. Rivian has persisted with its virtually button-free philosophy for 2025, and the R1S suffers greatly for it. This anti-tactile ethos applies to things such as mirror and steering column adjustments, climate control, and even the aim of the air vents, which are controlled by dragging icons on the 15.6-inch center screen. Even tech-centric Lucid doesn’t relegate climate control aim to its touchscreen.
While minimalism has its place, the R1S’s single-minded insistence on a screen-centric cabin is frustrating. It’s also at odds with its off-road audience: I shouldn’t need to remove my gloves after a long day skiing to re-aim my heat towards my hands. The NFC card “key” also gave me troubles, even on my short test drive, as the vehicle didn’t recognize I’d left it in the center console sometimes when I’d hop out to take photos.
The R1S also still lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functionality, although 2025 models offer a $149/year Connect+ subscription, which offers Apple Music and Spotify integration (as well as thousands of other streaming apps).
This puts the R1S in a strange spot. In 2025 models, Rivian dropped 40 pounds from the wiring, improved its motor and battery engineering, drastically cut the number of computers required on-board, and added hardware that can support semi-autonomous functionality to rival Autopilot and Super Cruise. (The complete semi-autonomous software  still isn’t available, although Rivian has added an automatic lane-change feature via an OTA update this summer.)
Buyers won’t notice most of these changes, though, and whatever cost savings the company found haven’t been passed on. With the $55,000 EV9 on the market and the launch dates for the Cadillac Vistiq, Lucid Gravity, and Hyundai’s to-be-named three-row EV all looming, the R1S has a much tougher case to make now than it did two years ago.

Lotus Teases Its New Electric Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/733737/lotus-electric-sports-teaser-video/,The so-called Theory 1 debuts later this week.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Lotus is going electric, as evidenced by the Emeya SUV and the Eletre sedan. The Emira, meanwhile, is the brand's last gas-powered vehicle and will only survive another few years. But that doesn't mean we won't get sports cars under Lotus's new electrification strategy. The first one (at least a concept of which) debuts on September 17.
Lotus shared two videos on social media previewing the next-gen sports car. Lotus calls it the Theory 1 and tosses out words like ""analog"" and ""natural"" to describe it, meant to harken back to the automaker's glory days.
From what we can see in the teaser, the vehicle has slim taillight bars on either side of a ""LOTUS"" wordmark. There's a Kammback-style rear end and an aggressive spoiler perched on top of it. It certainly doesn't look like an Emeya or Eletre from these angles.
The name Theory 1 suggests this is just a concept, but one that could preview an eventual production supercar or sports car. A new Lotus coupe was due in 2027—which the company codenamed the Type 135—but it may be pushed back due to battery technology issues. That EV would take on the upcoming Porsche Boxster / Cayman EV.
Rumors suggested this electric sports car would have 469 horsepower in base form and up to 872 horsepower with the dual-motor model, while starting at under $100,000. It would replace the Elise and Emira in the lineup, and use the Lotus LEVA (Lightweight Electric Vehicle Architecture) platform.
We'll have to wait and see if this electric Lotus actually comes to fruition.

Stellantis Invests $406M In U.S. Plants To Build BEVs Alongside ICE Models,https://www.motor1.com/news/733390/stellantis-investment-factories-bev/,"The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will be its first US factory to build a fully electric vehicle, the Ram 1500 REV.",12/25/2024 8:50,"On Wednesday, Stellantis announced it is investing $406 million into three Michigan factories. The money will go toward preparing the facilities to produce battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and their associated components, and the automaker plans to build BEVs alongside their combustion-powered counterparts as it navigates a changing automotive industry and faces questions about its future in the United States.
The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant is getting the bulk of the investment—$235.5 million—which will allow the facility to produce the electric Ram 1500 Rev and the range-extended 1500 Ramcharger. It’ll be the company’s first US plant to build a fully electric vehicle. (The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona will be built in Brampton, Ontario, just outside Toronto.) The company has installed a new conveyor system, new automation processes for BEVs, and retooling to allow it to build gas- and battery-powered pickups on the same line.
Nearly $100 million will go to preparing the Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce the electric Jeep Wagoneer. Stellantis will have the ability to assemble the electric vehicle on the same line as the combustion-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models, which should allow it to tweak production to better build the types of vehicles customers want.
Flexibility is something that Dodge CEO Matt McAlear talked about last month regarding the new Charger Daytona, which rides in the STLA Large platform that Stellantis is investing in. The Dodge will spawn BEV and combustion-powered models.
The smallest investment, $73 million, will go to improve the automaker’s Dundee Engine Plant. The money will help retool the factory to build battery trays for the STLA Frame platform later this year and front and rear beams for the STLA Large architecture in 2026. Stellantis will build those components alongside two new combustion engines, including a new 1.6-liter inline-four that the company could use for future hybrid-electric vehicles.
The future is unclear, especially for automakers. People must make vital decisions years before a product goes on sale. Stellantis has 14 brands under its control after the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles merged in 2021, and the company’s plan to give every one of them a decade to prove their worth remains in place even as sales decline and the lineup thins in the US. But it takes time to chart a new course, and we will see new products from Stellantis soon.

Remember The $250K Lightyear EV? The First One Is For Sale,https://www.motor1.com/news/733262/lightyear-0-ev-for-sale/,And it may sell for considerably less than the production car would've.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Step back in time a few years to the roaring teens—2019 to be exact. Electric cars were on the cusp of mainstream popularity and among them was the Lightyear 1, a sleek prototype sedan from the Finland-based upstart Lightyear. Along with standard charging capabilities, it could draw power from the sun thanks to a plethora of solar panels. Then came 2020 and well, you know what the world's been like ever since.
The Lightyear 1 prototype became the Lightyear 0 production car with a $250,000 sticker price, then production suddenly ended in 2023 shortly before Lightyear's operating company, Atlas Technologies, filed for bankruptcy. However, the original car still exists and you can imagine our surprise when it showed up on Troostwijk Auctions in the Netherlands just a few days ago. As of our post on September 10, the bidding stands at 13,500 euros, which equates to approximately $14,900. The auction closes at the end of September so there's still plenty of time for the price to climb higher.
What will the winning bidder get? The car is listed as chassis number 1, apparently fully functional with a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph) and a WLTP range of 388 miles from a 60.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack. If that sounds familiar, it's the same figures Lightyear promoted when production of the Lightyear 0 was announced. That goes for the estimated 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles) of solar-charged driving captured through the panels. In theory, provided you live in a nice, sunny location, one could do an average daily commute without needing a plug-in charger for months.
A quick visit to Lightyear's website (yes it still exists) shows the company is now working on solar charging technologies for automobiles. The Lightyear 0 and the proposed Lightyear 2—a considerably less expensive vehicle envisioned to take on the Tesla Model 3—are long gone. As far as we can tell, the car up for auction here could be the only example of its kind in the world.

VW Recalls ID.4 For Electronic Door Latches That Can Pop Open 'Unexpectedly',https://www.motor1.com/news/733370/vw-recalls-120k-cars-for-doors-could-open/,"Every ID.4 built for the United States and Canada is now recalled, totaling 119,408 vehicles.",12/25/2024 8:50,"Volkswagen is recalling all ID.4 EVs produced in the US. A problem with the electric door-opening mechanism could cause the doors to open spontaneously, which is most decidedly a safety risk at pretty much any speed. Fortunately, VW isn't aware of any accidents or injuries resulting from this problem. But there are 135 warranty claims connected to the issue.
The ID.4's door handles look traditional, but they're electrically operated. Pulling the handle activates the electric mechanism that pops the door open, and that's where the problem lies. According to the recall, some models may have issues with water working into the handles and reaching the circuit board inside. As you might expect, this can lead to glitches that include unlatching the doors. If this happens, drivers should hear an audible click similar to a door locking or unlocking.
VW has a fix in the works. Dealers will inspect ID.4 door handles and replace defective parts if necessary. In addition, new software will be uploaded to ""update the door handle parameters."" However, the automaker is still fleshing out the new parts and software code, so VW hasn't provided a timeframe for when the fix will be available. In the meantime, VW advises owners to ""contact an authorized Volkswagen dealer without delay to have the vehicle inspected"" if they experience a problem.
Dealer notification of the recall has already taken place. Specific owner notification will start on November 1, but if you own one of the 98,806 ID.4s US-built here in the country or the 20,602 in Canada, you're included in the recall.
If this all sounds familiar, VW issued an identical recall last year for 35,325 vehicles. Those were built at the company's factory in Zwickau, Germany. The latest recall now includes ID.4s built in the US as well.

Who Is Buying the Volvo C40?,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732893/2024-volvo-c40-recharge-review/,The electric coupe-SUV feels like it was made for the most niche Volvo buyer.,12/25/2024 8:50,"The Volvo C40 looks good. It's nice to drive. It's quiet, comfortable, and has just enough technology to keep people entertained. And at $59,995 as-tested for this single-motor, extended-range Ultimate model, it's not that pricey given the current luxury EV market.
But for as nice as it all is, I can't figure out who this car is for. The C40 is a Volvo SUV coupe—already a niche within a niche—sporting average range, an average charging rate, and less cargo space than its XC40 Recharge counterpart. It probably doesn't have hoards of people banging down Volvo's doors, and after a week behind the wheel, I'm not convinced even the nerdiest Volvo buyers will find much reason to take the C40 home.
If there's anything that might convince buyers, it's the way the C40 looks. In typical Volvo fashion, this SUV has clean lines, soft angles, and a few necessary—but not over-the-top—sporty cues. The slicked-back roof blends neatly into a trunk lid with a sporty spoiler on top. The taillights run up either side of the rear glass for a nice, cohesive shape. The front end, meanwhile, keeps most of the same elements that make the compact XC40 such a looker.
The interior follows suit: Sporty simplicity. You might be surprised to see cloth seats in a nearly $60,000 luxury vehicle, but they work here. The front and rear chairs have a great shape and feel, making them easy to sit in for hours on end. The rest of the cabin uses clean, simple lines and high-end materials—and a portrait-oriented 8.0-inch touchscreen graces the center of the dash.
Volvo uses the built-in Google system with maps, a voice assistant, Google Play Store access, and finally, Apple CarPlay. You still can't use your phone-based Android Auto, which is annoying, but the C40 runs Google Maps and other functions pretty seamlessly. My only complaint is that the touch response doesn't isn't up to par with modern smartphones, and the Android Automotive system hasn't changed much since its debut in 2019.
This single-motor, extended-range model has a 78.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack (usable capacity) sending power to a single, rear-mounted electric motor. With 248 horsepower and 310 pound-feet worth of instant torque, it takes this single-motor model a modest 6.9 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour, while the dual-motor version gets there in a brisk 4.5 seconds.
Most buyers will find the single-motor model quick enough. It has no issue pulling out in front of traffic and getting up to speed, or passing on the highway. Around town, the instant electrons make it feel zippy, and the aggressive one-pedal driving function means you can maneuver without even touching the brakes.
The C40 has decent moves in the corners, too. The updated 2024 model gains rear-wheel drive, which makes it more fun to flick around than some of the front-drive-based alternatives. The steering is quick, the suspension is responsive, and the single-motor model (while still a heavy vehicle at 4,453 pounds) feels lighter on its tires than some other EVs.
Ultimately though, the single-motor C40 leans into comfort, rather than sportiness. The cabin is coffin-quiet; No pesky gas-engine sounds infiltrating the interior. The only thing you might hear is some wind noise and tire roar at high speeds. According to my ears, the C40 is one of the quietest EVs out there.
But because of that sloped roof, the C40 isn’t as roomy as the XC40. It loses 2.4 inches of rear headroom and 8.5 cubic feet of cargo space compared to its traditional counterpart. It’s not totally uncomfortable, but with my six-foot frame, my head was nearly scraping the headliner.
The single-motor C40 has the better range of the two trims, driving up to 297 miles on a single charge according to the EPA. The dual-motor model gets just 257 miles of range by comparison. That puts the single-motor C40 smack dab in the middle of the pack; It has better range than the Genesis GV60 (294 miles) and Audi Q4 Sportback (265 miles), but falls short of the Ford Mustang Mach-E (320 miles) and Tesla Model Y (310 miles).
In terms of charging, the C40 sucks up electrons at a rate of 200 kilowatts on a DC fast charger. Volvo says that will get you from 10% to 80% in 28 minutes. The Mach-E will do the same in 32 minutes at 150 kilowatts and the Audi does 5% to 80% in 36 minutes at the same rate. The Kia EV6 and Genesis GV60 are the fastest chargers of the group, going from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes at 240 kilowatts.
So who is the Volvo C40 for, exactly? I still haven’t figured it out. The Model Y goes further, the EV6 and GV60 charge faster, and for way less money, you can get a Mach-E with 320 miles of range. If you want something that looks exceptionally pretty, then Volvo’s got you covered. Otherwise, the C40 is a tough sell.

Not Even the Mighty RS7 Can Keep Up With The Ioniq 5 N In A Drag Race,https://www.motor1.com/news/732569/ioniq-5-n-audi-rs7-drag-race/,"Audi's mighty Quattro all-wheel drive impresses against the EV performance car, but in a straight line, it's the Hyundai that wins.",12/25/2024 8:50,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is the performance car of the moment. It's the first purely electric car the Motor1 staff truly loves, thanks mostly to its ability to act like an internal combustion-powered vehicle. But it can still do the straight-line acceleration thing incredibly well.
The Carwow YouTube channel brought together an Ioniq 5 N and an Audi RS7 Performance to see which would be quicker in a series of drag races. The RS7 is among the mightiest cruise missile saloons on sale right now, packing 621 horsepower in Performance trim, getting torque to all four wheels via the company's iconic Quattro all-wheel drive.
The Hyundai is no slouch either, making a maximum of 641 horsepower when the boost function is activated. Thanks to its two electric motors, it also gets torque to all four corners. The most interesting factoid, though: Both cars weigh nearly the same, meaning this is a true head-to-head matchup.
In the first of three half-mile standing start drag races, the Audi gets a great start and holds its lead against the Hyundai until the finish. The second race has a far more even start between the two cars, resulting in an extremely close victory for the Ioniq 5. The last race is much of the same, with the EV taking the win by half a car length.
The Carwow team tries a couple of roll-races between the two cars as well. For the first one, the Ioniq 5 is placed into its fake gear-shift mode, which emulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Audi easily walks away with the win. For the next race, the Hyundai was switched to normal EV power delivery, and this time, it took the win (but just barely).
The only test where the Audi was able to secure a real victory was in the braking test. In a side-by-side test from 100 mph, the Audi comes to a stop several car lengths shorter than the Hyundai. While both cars weigh the same, the RS7's bigger brakes and stickier tires likely played a big role in its victory.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Has One Major Flaw,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732714/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-video-review/,It is one of the most impressive modern performance cars ever built. But it’s backed into an impossible corner.,12/25/2024 8:50,"Great cars don't come from a committee. Or practicality. Or from any ordinary common sense, really. Great cars come from single-minded devotion, a bit of neurodivergent hyperfixation, and a team given a long enough leash to define its mandate.
One of those great cars is the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.
Even though it's built on the bones of a commuter electric SUV, the Ioniq 5 N is one of the best-handling, most well-rounded, and most interesting vehicles on sale today. It's a true driver's car that prioritizes fun and feel over lap times.
The I5N exists within a fascinating context. The fear was that EVs would be too heavy and bloated to make good performance cars, but even at 4,861 pounds, the Ioniq weighs the same as the brand new and (controversially) hybridized Mercedes C63S E Performance, and hundreds of pounds less than the latest BMW M5. Compared to the Mercedes, at least, the Hyundai is miles better to drive.
But it still has one big flaw: You can’t take it on an aimless, meandering drive due to its severely compromised real-world range. That's a pretty big flaw. That problem could get fixed soon with a shiny new NACS connector, but I doubt it will ever be that simple.
In our latest video for the Motor1 YouTube channel, we explore the Ioniq 5 N in-depth, hosted by yours truly. Sit back and enjoy one of the most fascinating cars on sale today— sideways in a cloud of tire smoke.

BMW Built An Excellent 4 Series Sedan. It's Also An EV,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732414/2024-bmw-i4-ev-review/,"By leaving EV gimmicks behind, the 2024 i4 eDrive35 Gran Coupe does dignified electric conveyance with aplomb.",12/25/2024 8:50,"So much of the conversation about EVs isn't about EVs. We owe much of this to Elon and identity politics, of course, but even with the political shellac stripped back, we rarely talk about EVs in the context of ""normal"" automobiles.
The automakers are partly to blame.
In a desperate bid to separate their EV lineup from ""traditional"" vehicles, most automakers divert from established norms. For example, Mercedes won’t simply sell you an EV that looks, feels, and drives like an E-Class. Instead, it builds the awful EQE.
It’s a Mercedes sculpted by painfully generic ""aero"" body lines, wrapped around a dysfunctional interior. The EQE is an astonishingly fast vehicle that’s less joyful to ride than your dentist’s chair.
This is nearly an industry-wide phenomenon. Automakers think that because EVs use a fundamentally different means of propulsion that customers expect a fundamentally different driving experience.
What if, however, a company took its most-beloved model and did something different, preserving or even enhancing its road manners?
Take BMW. What if it built a normal 3 Series sedan that happened to have some batteries in the floor? How would it drive? How would it function?
Excellently, in fact.
BMW calls this mid-size EV sedan the *deep breath* 2024 BMW i4 eDrive35 Gran Coupe. Effectively, it’s a classic 3 Series sedan with a liftback, saddled by some clunky nomenclature.
That’s where the bad news ends. Once you hurdle the awkward naming conventions, you’ll find BMW has adhered to its older, better conventions.
Like every single 3 Series, the i4 GC looks great, drives pleasantly, and folds into daily life like it was borne into your own garage. During a week with the i4 Gran Coupe, I ran errands, suffered traffic, chased one sunset down a mountain backroad, and generally just lived with the car. The i4 didn’t misstep even once.
This is a great sedan, period. And even a great-looking one.
Despite riding on an EV “skateboard,” with batteries lining its belly, the i4 GC sticks with BMW’s classic sedan proportions. That means a long, low hood, with tight angles where they should be and swooping sections covering everything else. I still don’t love the gigantic buck-tooth grille, but painted in a dazzling silver called Dravit Grey Metallic ($1,500), the i4’s side profile and rear-three-quarter angles look spectacular (note the vehicle pictured here is the i4 edrive40 trim, slightly different to our hero car, but equally spectacular). None of this car’s proportions hint at electric propulsion.
Especially the smartly appointed interior, which offers ample headroom, a large and usable trunk (aided by that hatchback glass), and just enough luxury and technology to show its driver where that lease payment is going every month.
Instead of visual gimmicks, BMW’s design department simply penned a nice-looking sedan from every angle, inside and out, and threw it to the engineering department to do the rest.
Beneath that finely tailored exterior, an 81.5-kilowatt lithium-ion battery pack powers a single rear motor producing 282 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, all sent to the rear wheels.
This slug of power and the i4’s low-drag body amount to a combined 110 MPGe over a projected range of 252 miles. Over the course of my week in the i4, I used maybe a “half tank” of electrons. Never did I suffer range anxiety, though super commuters may get squeamish.
These are not industry-leading numbers for range or efficiency, but they were sufficient for my family’s needs. A simple nightly recharge would cover 95 percent of driving scenarios, and I suspect fit neatly into the lives of many suburban families shopping for a BMW sedan.
If you don’t have the ability to charge this BMW in your garage overnight (a convenience that’s probably not considered enough), you’re better served by a gas-powered Bimmer.
BMW claims 5.8 seconds to 60 miles per hour, but from a few hard pulls up to interstate speeds, I’d say that figure’s pessimistic by a huge chunk. My old M3 hit 60 in about 5.5 seconds and this i4 would leave it for dead. From a dig, or on a highway pull, i4 will rip right up to its 118 mph top speed in moments.
Rather than beat you over the head with its EV-ness during those hard accelerations, BMW plays just a scooch of simulated powertrain noise over the i4 GC’s interior speakers. It’s one of the few pure EV gimmicks you’ll find here and the car can be spec’d without it. The sound is so subtle I preferred to keep it on, if only to pair some audio feedback with the snap of EV acceleration.
This BMW’s EV powertrain offers a traditional two-pedal driving routine, along with one-pedal driving as well. The latter option felt crisp and well-calibrated, with a snappy transition to braking when the go-fast pedal is released. The one-pedal system feels especially crisp but never distracting with the i4’s drive mode selector set to “Sport.”
I prefer the pedal sensitivity, steering weight, and suspension response of Sport. While I wish the Sport damping curve felt a bit more lax, you can imagine the amount of spring rate BMW had to throw at a vehicle this heavy to make it feel responsive, and the damping required to rein in this EV’s rebounding body.
Still, Sport offers the most-responsive calibration of each major chassis and powertrain system, livening the i4 GC from relaxed conveyance into a true Sport Sedan.
With a base price of $52,200, this eDrive35 trim offers the best value among the i4 range. It’s plenty quick for daily driving and backroad hustling, quick enough that I wouldn’t be tempted by more-expensive trims.
The M Sport package ($3100) feels like a must-have, owing to the adaptive suspension and gorgeous wheels, but I could leave everything else off the build sheet (though the Harman Kardon sound system would tempt me at $875, as would San Remo green paint ($650) and heated seats ($500)).
That places the i4 eDrive 35 squarely in competitive territory, pitted against ICE sedans, hybrids, and EVs alike. But none of them offer the goldilocks mix of this BMW.
Its gas-powered competitors are slower, less composed, and often have less badge equity. Hybrid cars doubly so. Other EVs will outpace this BMW for around $55,000, but none look as handsome and drive as nicely.
Lease deals on these cars keep getting sweeter. As a second vehicle to sit beside the gas-powered truck or SUV that already lives in your garage, it’s a deeply competitive offering from BMW.
In that way, this new BMW is a lot like the old BMWs we love so much. It blends form with function, backs up its good looks with amenities, and pairs quick reflexes to superb road manners.
The i4 eDrive 35 Gran Coupe is a great BMW sedan. It’s also an EV.

2024 Kia EV9: The Good And The Bad,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/731077/2024-kia-ev9-pros-cons-review/,"Kia’s first electric three-row is a solid performer, but it’s not without flaws.",12/25/2024 8:50,"The 2024 Kia EV9 is one of the only mainstream three-row EVs you can get, and it gets the basics right. This SUV is efficient, charges quickly thanks to a high-voltage architecture, and is extremely comfortable even full of people. Just on that basis, it’s a good buy.
There are a lot of little things that could be polished, however. The ride could use work, the charging is fast but not without hiccups (unrelated to charging infrastructure), and the interior—while packed full of amenities—lacks a premium touch in terms of look and feel.
Ultimately, it’s not enough to dissuade a respective buyer from going all-in, but if it were my $78,430 to spend, I might wait for the facelift in a few years.
Let’s get the bad stuff out of the way first, because the foibles were enough to dampen what was otherwise a very pleasant experience.
I drove nearly 1,000 miles in the EV9, and three out of the four times I charged it, the car didn’t want to shift into drive or reverse afterward, which was frustrating. At first, I thought it was because the battery had overheated, although talking with Kia, I realized that was not the case. More likely, it was a user error on my part, which, in my opinion, seems more like a design failure than my own incompetence (although don’t put that past me.)
If I sat in the car while it was charging with the AC on, a red battery icon showed up on the dash after I unplugged the vehicle. It looked exactly the same as if the 12-volt battery in a normal car had a fault. There was no message in the infotainment telling me what to do—I just couldn't shift into drive or reverse. After cycling the car’s power several times (thankfully, the EV9 still has a physical on/off switch, unlike many other EVs), eventually it came back to life. Each time I was stuck in the charging stall for around five minutes, unsure of what to do.
Speaking to a Kia representative, it seemed like using the vehicle’s systems (AC, infotainment, etc.), while the car is charging puts it into ""accessory mode,"" which makes it unable to shift into drive or reverse. An extra tap on the brake pedal would’ve allegedly taken me out of this mode, but that was definitely something I tried. Maybe I didn’t have the process going in the right order, but needless to say, if you’re charging your EV9 it might just be best to turn the car off and get out to avoid any frustration.
The other foibles were pretty minor by comparison. The main functions of the center display are accessible via a series of capacitive buttons on the dash that require a hard press to activate, compressing the hard plastic they’re embedded in. It feels and sounds bad. The menus also have a small but nevertheless annoying amount of lag, and they’re not organized well.
At high speeds, the ride is poor. Despite having fully independent suspension, the EV9 judders over broken pavement on the highway like a pickup truck. Smaller wheels and tires, at least smaller than the 20-inch alloys on this tester, would do it favors. To be clear, though, this ride characteristic is a feature of many electric vehicles, especially crossovers and SUVs. It’s not unique to the EV9.
The good things were momentous in comparison, especially if you frequently carry a lot of people around.
The seats in the EV9 are a step above almost anything I’ve driven, including the six-figure Mercedes-Benz EQS, the Cadillac Escalade, and even the Kia Carnival—a very plush minivan with similar features but not nearly the same level of comfort. Either of the two highest EV9 trims can be specced with eight-way adjustable second-row captain chairs, which are heated and ventilated (a second-row bench is standard). The driver and passenger get the same treatment, with the addition of a massage feature for the driver.
Using the seats' heating/cooling function instead of the regular HVAC will save you a fair amount of range, as the car’s energy consumption menu clearly shows. Range fluctuations of 5 to 10 miles are possible on hot days if you use the car’s heat pump. That said, the EV9 is efficient even if you’re not micromanaging it.
I averaged over three miles per kWh over the hundreds of miles I drove, which puts its realistic range easily above its EPA estimate of 280 miles. Indeed, it’s even better than the smaller two-row Cadillac Lyriq I drove earlier this year, though that car was driven during an especially chilly and rainy New England winter.
In other words, the EV9 can go the distance, at least with the larger battery. According to the EPA, the standard battery on the EV9 will take you just 230 miles. Opting for rear-wheel drive versus all-wheel drive will likewise net you more range, although that’s a luxury some buyers will doubtlessly think twice about giving up.
AWD also unlocks the EV9’s full performance. The base RWD car gets just 215 horsepower, which is not a lot for an SUV that weighs in at just over 5,000 pounds. AWD EV9s are heavier at around 5,700 lbs, but they get a dual motor setup good for 379 hp, which is more than enough for a family SUV.
The competition, especially from America, will pick up in short order, though. On the higher end, Lucid will soon start production of its three-row Gravity SUV. It will be more expensive than the EV9, but it will charge faster and go much further. Likely over 400 miles. The Cadillac Vistiq will also arrive next year as a 2026 model-year vehicle. Its range will be very similar to the Kia’s, and using the Lyriq’s and Optiq’s excellent interior as a reference, it could be even more pleasant inside.
Even with some imminent competition on the horizon, though, the EV9 is a solid option for people who want to go electric but need room for seven or more people. Sure, there are a lot of little things that could use some work, but the overall package is impressive. Despite being the first electric three-row out there, it will doubtlessly be a strong competitor in the growing segment.

It's Official: Nissan Is Working on a New Silvia Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/732599/new-nissan-silvia-development-starts/,"Work has started on a third sports car, but a production version has still yet to be approved.",12/25/2024 8:50,"It’s been over a decade since Nissan introduced the retro-flavored IDx concept, hinting at a third sports car alongside the 370Z and GT-R. The former 370Z was replaced by the new Z, and the GT-R is dead—at least for the time being. The IDx, meanwhile, would've been too costly to produce and there wasn't enough demand. Nissan was also concerned it would've cannibalized sales of the 370Z.
However, Nissan has been dropping hints lately about launching a third performance model. The company has gone on record several times about resurrecting the beloved Silvia nameplate. But now it's official: The Silvia is coming back.
In a new interview with Australia's Drive magazine, a high-ranked official confirmed the sports car is officially in the works. Nissan Vice-President Global Product Strategy Ivan Espinosa shared the good news: ""We've been doing some very early upstream exercises of what the architecture could look like.""
An ""upstream exercise"" is a business process that basically refers to initial planning and the early stages of development. Espinosa aims for Nissan to have the sports car ready before the end of the decade with an electrified powertrain. That may be bad news for purists but a gas-only setup wouldn't work globally, especially in Europe where there are stringent emissions regulations that keep getting stricter.
Nissan wants the reborn Silvia to comply with regulations in as many countries as possible so it can ramp up production to achieve economies of scale. Even though sports cars are a niche market and developing one from scratch is a costly endeavor, Nissan won't join forces with another automaker to make it happen. Rather than going down the Z4/Supra, GR86/BRZ, or Miata/124 Spider route, the new Silvia will be an all-Nissan effort.
Espinosa is confident the company can ride solo in the engineering process but admits the project necessitates ""a serious level of investment,"" which is a ""difficult"" commitment to make. A new Silvia would be developed from the ground up, and his wish is for Nissan to skip a collaboration with another brand.
""I'm trying, as I said and I keep saying it in my brain, three sports cars in my lineup, a GT-R, a Z, and something else. And this something else in my brain is called the Silvia. Now, will we do it? I'm trying. I'm not sure we're going do it, just to be 100% clear, but It's something that I would like to do if we, if we can. I'm trying to make it work, I'm trying to make it happen. It's not an easy case. it's not easy because the sports cars market is shrinking.""
The fact of the matter is sports cars don't sell all that well. Nissan took its sweet time replacing the 370Z with a Z, and that's not even an all-new vehicle. It's understandable why the company is reluctant to pour a lot of money in what would ultimately be a niche product when it already has one (Z) and is working on another (GT-R). The mighty Godzilla going on a multi-year hiatus goes to show why Nissan is not rushing to replace the R35 anytime soon.
Launching a third sports car adds another level of complexity during challenging times for Nissan given the need to electrify its lineup. We can only hope that it makes the cut considering the Silvia's cult following and the scarcity of affordable sports cars. Honda's reborn Prelude gives us hope this segment of the market can survive in an SUV-hungry world.

Legendary Rally Car Maker Prodrive Builds An Electric Cargo Van Now,https://www.motor1.com/news/732582/evolv-electric-cargo-van-prodrive/,"It’s called the Elm Mobility Evolv, and it can go up to 100 miles on a charge.",12/25/2024 8:50,"Prodrive makes cool stuff. The Oxfordshire, England-based engineering firm gave us the stunning P25 Subaru 22B restomod, several Le Mans-spec race cars, a handful of Dakar trophy trucks, and of course, Colin McRae's legendary Subaru rally cars. Now Prodrive is teaming up with Astheimer Design for an adorable utility van.
The joint project is called Elm Mobility, and the first product out of that partnership is the pint-sized Evolv electric van. Designed for use as a ""last-mile"" delivery vehicle, the Evolv van is a mere 128.0 inches long, 57.0 inches wide, and weighs just 1,874 pounds.
The van's main cargo area can hold freight up to 5.2 feet tall and weighing more than 660 pounds. A secondary cargo area (accessible via rear ""barn doors"") offers another 3.9 feet and 440 pounds worth of capability. It even has a turning radius of 25.6 feet—just shy of a London taxi cab's 25.0-foot turning radius.
The driver sits in a single-seat cabin with a huge wraparound windshield for maximum visibility (it even has two windshield wipers). But don't worry, Elm says the Evolv meets N1 (small van) safety crash standards in Europe. It also promises to be one of the most capable and efficient vehicles in the L7e category.
The proposed battery is a 20.0-kilowatt-hour pack with about 100 miles of range—just enough for short-distance deliveries. Plugging into a level 2 charger would refill the van from 20-80 percent in less than two hours. The listed top speed is just 50 miles per hour, but Elm says that other battery configurations are ""under consideration.""
The Elm Evolv van is just a concept for now, but production is planned for 2028. The company is currently working with an investor in the US to bring a small fleet of electric vans Stateside, but the majority of them will remain in Europe. Elm wants to build 10,000 units annually by 2030, with pricing estimated to be somewhere in the $30,000 mark (£25,000).

BMW Will Launch A Hydrogen Car In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/732646/2028-bmw-hydrogen-car-confirmed/,It's teaming up with Toyota to make it happen.,12/25/2024 8:50,"A new player is about to enter the hydrogen game as BMW has confirmed plans to roll out a fuel cell electric vehicle in 2028. To bring the project to fruition, it's expanding its existing collaboration with Toyota, one of the few other automakers that still believes hydrogen has a future. While the Japanese brand has been selling the Mirai for a decade, this will be BMW's first hydrogen car people will actually be able to buy.
Since the vehicle won't be launching for another four years, BMW refrains from going into details. However, it does say the hydrogen model will be a version of an existing product. Munich’s latest hydrogen project is based on the X5. That being said, logic tells us a hydrogen SUV would not be a production version of the iX5 pictured here. This generation of the luxobarge is already in the second half of its life cycle. By 2028, it will have been replaced by the next-gen vehicle.
Whichever shape it'll take, BMW pledges to sell an original product that'll stay true to the brand instead of being a reskinned Toyota. Naturally, the latter is working on its own cars that will utilize the hydrogen fuel cell tech it's developing with its Bavarian partner. In the meantime, it's worth noting the fuel cells that go into the iX5 Hydrogen are supplied by Toyota.
The zero-emission SUV is part of a test fleet of fewer than 100 units built in Spartanburg and modified at a pilot plant in Munich. It's where the 396-horsepower iX5 gets its pair of 700-bar hydrogen tanks made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The two hold six kilograms of hydrogen for a WLTP range of 313 miles. It takes three to four minutes to refuel the vehicle, so about the same as a gas or diesel X5.
Provided BMW's first hydrogen car will be based on the next-generation X5, it'll be underpinned by the same CLAR platform as the gas/diesel/plug-in hybrid versions. There are reports that BMW might also launch a conventional EV with batteries on the same architecture as the rest of the X5 flavors. The next X5 is supposedly going into production in the latter half of 2026 and should include BEV versions from day one.
Arriving next year, Neue Klasse will be BMW’s first dedicated electric architecture and is being developed with a hydrogen fuel cell setup in mind. However, reports indicate that CLAR will be used instead, at least for the initial hydrogen efforts.
This might come as a surprise, but BMW has been actively involved in the development of hydrogen cars since 1979. It all started with the 520h featuring a combustion engine modified to run on hydrogen, a formula that was repeated later with the V-12-powered E38 and E65 sedans during the 2000s. That said, work on hydrogen ICEs was abandoned many years ago as the engineers preferred to focus on fuel cells after realizing they're more efficient.
Speaking with GoAuto earlier this year, Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group, said:
""Basically, with the X5 Hydrogen FCEV we get around 500 km [310 miles] from a fill. If I put a combustion engine in the same car with the same tank, I wouldn't even get 300 km [186 miles]. That is the difference between a product we can sell, and a product we cannot sell. At the 500-km [310-mile] mark, and with a refueling time of three to four minutes, I think people will consider making the move to hydrogen – so, it is relevant.""
There is a major problem we'd like to highlight. Yes, the refueling infrastructure. It’s basically nonexistent in many parts of the world, so we won’t be surprised if the vehicle will only be sold in select regions where owners can juice up their hydrogen cars. 2028 is four years away and the network might improve by then. BMW and Toyota do say they’re ""seeking regional or local projects to further drive the development of hydrogen infrastructure through collaborative initiatives.""

"Volvo Admits Defeat, Won't Go Fully Electric by 2030",https://www.motor1.com/news/732504/volvo-backtracks-ev-goal-2030/,New target: plug-in hybrids and EVs should account for 90-100% of sales.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Volvo was one of the first automakers to promise an electric-only lineup. If you recall, the original announcement was made in March 2021. At the end of May 2024, Volvo's CEO said an EV-only portfolio is still ""very achievable."" At that point, Jim Rowan was ""confident"" Volvo could end sales of vehicles with combustion engines in just five years.
However, during the most recent quarterly investor webcast held in late July, the automaker's CEO admitted that it'll ""take time to bridge different parts of the world for full electrification."" In other words, the initial goal to become a pure EV brand by 2030 might not be achieved. Fast forward to early September, Volvo is now officially readjusting its lofty electric goals.
The new target is for plug-in hybrids and electric cars to account for 90-100% of annual sales by the end of the decade. Volvo concedes cars without charging ports are likely to stick around longer than initially estimated, but only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models.""
The Swedish marque believes several factors have contributed to the slower-than-projected adoption of EVs. The development of the charging infrastructure is progressing at a slower pace. In addition, some countries have either reduced or completely eliminated incentives for EVs. Volvo also blames newly applied tariffs on electric cars in certain markets.
Volvo hopes cars with a charging cord (PHEVs+EVs) will account for 50-60% of deliveries by 2025, up from 48% during the second quarter of this year. From April through June, fully electric cars accounted for 26% of total shipments. The company's plan is to continue investments in mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid models as part of its ""strategic adjustments"" to better reflect what people want.
In the long run, Volvo still wants to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Volvo is the latest in a long string of automakers to backtrack from its original electric goals. In recent months, we've seen the likes of Porsche, Mercedes, Bentley, and Ford of Europe push back their aggressive electric agendas.

"Lotus Isn't Doing Well, Guys",https://www.motor1.com/news/731781/lotus-financial-results-first-half-2024/,"Despite a big increase in deliveries, Lotus Tech suffered a net loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in the second quarter of 2024.",12/25/2024 8:51,"Lotus's foray into electric cars has had a rocky start. While financial results for the first half of 2024 show a big increase in deliveries over last year, the company has cut its deliveries forecast by over 50 percent. Meanwhile, its losses are only going up.
Lotus Technology, the publicly traded company spun out of Lotus Group responsible for building and selling cars, was previously expecting to deliver around 26,000 cars this year.
""After assessment of the evolving market conditions, and uncertainties posed by new tariff policies in US and EU, the company has revised its delivery target for 2024 to 12,000 units,"" Lotus Tech said in a statement published Wednesday.
The company has sold 4,873 cars globally so far this year, an increase of 239% versus 2023. The spike can be attributed to the start of deliveries for Lotus's two new electric cars, the Electre SUV and the Emeya sedan. The brand has sold 2,389 sedans and SUVs so far in 2024, over just 871 units in 2023.
2024 Lotus Eletre
2024 Lotus Emeya
Deliveries of the gas-powered Lotus Emira sports car have also exploded in the first half of this year. Lotus has sold 2,484 units in 2024 so far, up from just 568 cars in the year prior. This is likely due to the company's ability to start deliveries in the US after years of emissions-related hold-ups.
Despite a huge jump in revenue to accompany the sales—$225 million for the quarter versus just $111 million last year—Lotus's net loss has only widened. It posted a $202 million loss for the quarter, up from $193 million last year. The company says the increase comes from selling and marketing expenses related to its expansion, according to Automotive News.
Not all hope is lost, thankfully. Lotus launched a plan called ""Win26,"" described as a strategy to ""further optimize its internal processes and structures, implementing overall cost measures, and recalibrating its product plans to cater to globally diversified markets,"" with a goal to achieve positive operating cash flow and EBITDA in 2026.
With demand for EVs waning, only time will tell if the brand can turn things around.

Honda's EV Plans Have 'Not Changed',https://www.motor1.com/news/731394/honda-ev-plans-not-changed-interview/,Honda Global Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama says EVs aren't going anywhere.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Honda was relatively late to the game on electrification. Only now are we seeing the Prologue and Acura ZDX on the road—both of which use GM's Ultium platform. But even as EV enthusiasm wanes, a new bespoke platform for Acura's next electric SUV and an entire range of 0 Series products means Honda has no plans of slowing its EV roll.
""Many people are talking about the slowdown of EV sales,"" Honda Global Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama told journalists during a roundtable event in Monterey. ""Our focus is clear based on our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.""
2024 Honda Saloon EV Concept
""We have not changed our belief that battery EVs are the most effective solution in the area of small mobility, such as motorcycles or automobiles,"" he continued. ""We are still in the early days of the EV era… We remain confident that the EV shift will continue to proceed steadily… So we will keep our long-term view and we expect that this ecosystem will change step by step.""
For Honda, EVs are still part of the plan. This comes at a time when other automakers have started to roll back EV investments. Ford and General Motors are diverting more funds to plug-in hybrids, while companies like Audi and Mercedes-Benz are pushing their timelines back by years.
But that’s not to say Honda is going all-in on EVs—at least not yet. Kazuhiro Takizawa, the CEO of American Honda, noted that the company will take a ""balanced"" approach to electrification and that ICE and hybrid vehicles will still be part of Honda’s upcoming plans.
2024 Honda Saloon EV Concept
""We will continue to invest in the strength of our hybrid and ICE vehicles,"" Takizawa said, ""giving us a balanced and flexible approach to electrification.… We are taking a unique, flexible approach at our EV hub in Ohio where we will begin the first phase of EV production late next year. This will enable us to better produce all of our gas and electric vehicles on the same production line.""
Honda’s new 0 Series platform introduced at CES earlier this year will underpin future Honda SUVs and even a sports car. Acura will adopt the platform for its performance EV SUV—based on the concept debuted in Monterey—and an ""NSX-Type"" sports car, which Aoyama confirmed in the same interview. This new EV platform, Honda says, will be ""light.""
""We are trying to build a strong EV brand, not an EV business to achieve our goal of zero environmental impact,"" Aoyama notes. ""That is our biggest mission facing us today.""

"Dodge CEO: The Charger Daytona EV Is A 'Better, Faster' Muscle Car",https://www.motor1.com/news/731380/dodge-ceo-charger-daytona-ev/,The brand's new boss wants to continue pushing SRT as its halo product.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Stroll through your local Dodge dealer, and you'll likely notice a few remaining Chargers and Challengers left on the lot. Production might have ended for the duo last December, but the glut of remaining stock isn't an accident. The automaker worked with its dealers to ensure they still had product available as it prepared to launch the next-generation Charger.
The brand plans to have fewer than 2,000 Charger and Challengers on lots when the 2024 Charger Daytona EV begins to arrive later this year, according to Dodge brand's new CEO, Matt McAlear, who spoke with Motor1 earlier this month, but it'll continue to have a limited lineup for the foreseeable future.
Dodge will begin building the coupe versions of the new electric Charger Daytona R/T and Scat Pack models sometime this summer, a decision he said was made long before he took over as boss on June 1. A few years ago, automakers went all-in on their electric vehicle plans, laying out ambitious timelines to convert their lineups to battery power, including Stellantis.
""We're putting our best foot forward,"" McAlear told us. ""As excited as I am that this is an EV, we're not going to market this as the new EV."" He said Dodge didn't set out to make a car with the best drag coefficient or the best range. ""We went out to design the best muscle car.""
The Charger Daytona Scat Pack with the standard Stage 2 package will launch with 670 peak horsepower, 627 pound-feet of torque, all-wheel drive, and a $75,185 starting price. The quickest version will reach 60 miles per hour in 3.3 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds. Dodge has already teased that there will be an even more powerful Banshee variant, but are hardcore SRT fans really ready to convert from gas to electrons?
""Some are. Some aren't,"" McAlear admitted, adding that customers don't become EV converts overnight.
However, he said he's encouraged by the fact that Dodge has ""the youngest demographic in the mainstream industry, and they have the highest propensity to adopt electric,"" which may be true, but the brand has spent two decades cultivating a following that's only been fed increasingly high-powered V-8 Hemi engines. This steady V-8 diet has set certain expectations for Dodge's customers, one that kilowatts and electric motors might not be able to satisfy.
The STLA Large platform underpinning the new Charger is profitable with the electric powertrains and flexible enough to meet consumer demand. While Dodge is launching the electric two-door first, followed by four-door Daytona production early next year, it will also have a combustion-powered version called the Charger Sixpack.
It will sit below the all-electric cars while riding on the same platform. It'll have some styling differences and feature the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter Hurricane straight-six already offered in Jeep and Ram, making 420 or 550 hp in SO and HO variants. The Sixpack will be the cheaper entry point into the new Charger lineup, but combustion-loving Dodge buyers will have to wait to buy one.
Production will begin in the second half of 2025, leaving the Charger Daytona to fend for itself as a premium offering in Dodge's thinning lineup until next year. The Charger Daytona R/T is cheaper, at $61,950 to start, nearly $30,000 more than the outgoing, V-6-powered Chargers and Challengers.
The 2024 Hornet starts at $32,995, and the Durango is $42,265, which gives McAlear plenty of room for the ""mainstream performance"" products he feels a future Dodge lineup has to support. He also wants to continue to push SRT as the brand's halo. Bringing products to market without an SRT or ultra-performance element ""does not constitute where we want to continue to grow as America's performance brand,"" he said.
""It needs to be the right nameplates that are done in the Dodge manner that stand out in the sea of sameness,"" McAlear said, unable to provide any hints about upcoming products. This is a big task when horsepower is cheap with battery-electric powertrains.
Dodge hopes features like its Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust can help differentiate the electric Charger from other BEVs, but we'll have to wait to see how consumers react once it's on sale. There has been vocal online criticism of Dodge's shift to electric powertrains, and overall consumer sentiment toward EVs is beginning to wane, especially in America.
The Charger Daytona EV is a ""new, better, faster"" muscle car, according to McAlear, but Dodge will have to work to convince its fans to follow it into a new era. It could alienate the fanbase it worked so hard to grow, and the debates about Dodge's direction will continue until the new Charger hits the road and customers can experience it for themselves.
""If there wasn't debate, if there wasn't consternation, I think I'd be more worried,"" McAlear said.

The Electric Porsche Panamera Won't Kill The Gas Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/731426/porsche-electric-panamera-confirmed/,The two will peacefully coexist for many years.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Porsche is playing its cards right with the Cayenne by keeping the gas versions on sale even after the next-generation electric model arrives later this decade. The ICE car will be offered well into the 2030s. Porsche will follow a similar strategy for the Panamera.
Launched earlier this year, the third-generation Panamera has a long shelf life ahead of it. Speaking with Autocar, Porsche's research and development boss confirmed plans for an all-electric Panamera. Michael Steiner told the British magazine the model's duality will echo that of the SUV: ""The new Cayenne is fully electric, but for its whole lifespan we will have the ICE version in parallel. It's the same for the Panamera.""
Considering the electric Panamera launch date hasn't even been announced, and the ICE model will be available during the EV's life cycle, the gas car will likely remain on sale into the next decade. But where will the Panamera without a combustion engine fit in Porsche's lineup? Based on a previous statement made by CEO Oliver Blume, the car could slot above the Taycan: ""I think it could work [having both EVs] because they are playing in different segments. The Panamera is one step higher than the Taycan.""
Porsche has already applied this ICE+EV strategy with the gas and electric Macan models. Well, kind of. The conventionally powered crossover dies in 2026. Meanwhile, it has already been discontinued in Europe because it no longer complies with a stricter cybersecurity law that came into effect earlier this year.
For the same reason, the 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman are no longer for sale in the EU. The sports car duo remains available in other markets but it too will be retired at some point in 2025 to make way for electric replacements.
Porsche still hopes it will reach its target of having EVs account for 80% of sales by 2030 and is renewing the products to pave the way. The large three-row SUV coming later this decade will be exclusively electric. However, the Zuffenhausen-based company is a bit more cautious in terms of EV adoption now that it has realized ""this transition will happen slower in a lot of markets,"" according to Steiner.
He also believes synthetic fuel could help during this gradual switch from ICE to EV by blending e-fuels with gas: ""By the end of the decade, there could be a significant share of e-fuel in use. We could, little by little, gallon by gallon, substitute fossil fuel with e-fuel by mixing a blend.""
Since December 2022, Porsche has been producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile. As a refresher, the combustion engine is expected to get a new lease on life in the EU as sales of new ICE cars could continue after 2035 as long as they're powered by carbon-neutral fuel. However, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse is worried the legislation surrounding the use of synthetic fuels could turn out to be a ""bogus solution:""
""There are currently many indications that the EU Commission is striving for a bogus solution in which the ban on combustion engines is relaxed simply by ostensibly opening up to e-fuels. However, if it then does nothing to accelerate the ramp-up of low-CO2 fuels and make their use practicable, this would be a deliberate ban on combustion engines through the back door.""
Whatever the case may be, Porsche is not abandoning the development of combustion engines. Steiner said investments will continue to be made in the V-6 and V-8 to comply with tougher emissions regulations.

"The ID.Buzz Could've Redeemed VW. Instead, It's Too Little, Too Late",https://www.motor1.com/features/730925/id-buzz-will-fail-opinion/,"With a $60,000-plus base price, the ID.Buzz looks like a swing and a miss on arrival. That’s not what VW needs right now.",12/25/2024 8:51,"Volkswagen needs a hit. The ID.Buzz probably won’t be it.
On Tuesday, VW announced US pricing for the long-awaited electric reinterpretation of its iconic Microbus. We knew the ID.Buzz would be expensive, but sheesh, this thing really isn't cheap. It costs $61,545, while the 1st Edition with all-wheel drive is another $10,000 dearer. And on top of that, the Buzz’s range disappoints—234 miles for the rear-drive version, 231 miles for the all-wheel drive.
Dieselgate forced Volkswagen’s hand, pushing the company hard towards EVs. It also turned public opinion against the automaker, a hurdle VW has yet to overcome. The ID.Buzz, a shameless nostalgia play at VW’s golden era, could’ve papered over some of VW’s sins and generated—sorry—buzz for the brand’s coming line of ID models. Instead, this Bus feels too little, too late, and too expensive.
Imagine if the ID.Buzz came out as VW’s first ID car in 2019 or 2020, with a price starting around $40,000. Perhaps wishful thinking, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say that at a lower price, and with a much earlier release, the ID.Buzz could’ve been a moment, the return of a beloved icon at a relatively attainable price. It could’ve had a real cultural impact at a time when EV adoption felt more cautious and critical, and it could’ve changed the conversation around VW.
Instead, VW launched the ID brand with the (not-sold-in-America) ID.3 and ID.4, both of which were disappointments. The ""3"" in ID.3 signified VW’s third game changer, after the Beetle and the Golf. Now, it seems VW will drop the ID.3 entirely in favor of… an electric Golf… which it once sold as the E-Golf, then canceled, only to revive. Apparently.
VW’s huge Dieselgate penalties, combined with heavy and sudden investment in an EV range, meant the automaker had to cost-cut the hell out of its cars. That manifested in the ID models and its gas cars. We went from the Mk7 Golf, a high water mark for the model and one of the nicest cars in the world at any price, to the Mk8, defined by its cheap-feeling interior, user-hostile haptic controls, and a truly baffling infotainment system. The recent Golf facelift aims to right at least some of these wrongs, but the damage was done.
So now we live in a world where people are apathetic about Volkswagen at best, hostile at worst. In comes the ID.Buzz.
We know it has a lot of the same haptic controls people already hate in the Golf, though the Buzz at least has the VW’s newer and seemingly better infotainment system. Still, it is a $60,000-plus Volkswagen minivan. The Boomers nostalgic for VW’s 1960s glory can probably afford it, but one imagines the market for the Buzz is pretty niche.
Plus, it arrives years late, as consumer interest in EVs cools (if not becomes outright hostile, depending on your political slant). Rightly or wrongly, Americans also want range, and sub-250 miles for this sort of money makes ID.Buzz an even harder sell.
Motor1 editorial director Travis Okulski posits that the ID.Buzz could be like the Lotus Elise. When the car finally came to America in 2005, those who wanted an Elise immediately bought them. Then sales cratered. That first year was by far the best for Elise sales, with 3,321 in the U.S. By 2011, its final year, Lotus sold 178 Elise… which was actually up from 2010, when it sold just 95.
And as our colleagues at InsideEVs noted yesterday, automakers need expensive EVs to be successful. It doesn’t cost automakers much more to build a larger, nicer car than to build a cheaper, smaller one. So the auto industry would rather sell fewer of the former than more of the latter. But automakers actually have to sell those larger cars in the first place. It’s hard to see VW moving a lot of ID.Buzzes at this price and time.
You can’t help but imagine what could’ve been. Change a couple details in its story and the ID.Buzz could’ve been the thing that got people excited about VW and its ID line when that’s what the brand needed most. Imagine if VW had caught the #vanlife craze in full swing?
Of course, Dieselgate always signaled a decline in VW quality from the exceptional heights of the Mk7 Golf. But positive sentiment generated by the Buzz could’ve softened the blow.
Instead, we get an expensive niche product that comes long after VW’s hard-earned goodwill has evaporated. Put another way, the ID.Buzz is what Volkswagen will try to sell you, but far from what the company needs.

It Doesn't Take Much To See That The Future Of EVs Is Already Here,https://www.motor1.com/features/730273/the-future-of-evs-is-already-here/,The mood of the day is betting against the astonishing march of technology. That is so unbelievably stupid.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Betting against technological progress seems to be in vogue now. That’s been a terrible bet since The Industrial Revolution.
But when it comes to electric vehicles, the pessimism seems unending. Batteries will never get more energy-dense, the proliferation of electric motors will cause a permanent shortage of copper and rare earth minerals, and the planet will run out of lithium before your EV’s third lease payment.
How many papers and opinion columns have you read like that?
If you tune into the technology that’s available even right now, though, you’ll realize those columns are total bullshit. Batteries are about to take a big step, power electronics are striding ahead already, and electric motors are positively rocketing into the future.
In the case of the latter two, we’re talking about components and drive units already in cars, not some YouTube thumbnail pipe-dream. In the case of battery cells, too, the technology already exists. It’s simply on its way to being industrialized.
Let’s get batteries out of the way first, because that seems to be on the front of everybody’s mind. Solid-state batteries are real. Suppliers to major automakers like Ford, BMW, and Volkswagen have already sent them cells for verification. These suppliers didn’t find them on Alibaba, they aren’t some slurry-state middle-ground that’s being hyped to the moon in China. They’re real solid-state cells that are going to end up in cars. BMW is claiming it will have an SSB-powered concept vehicle “before 2025.” After that, it’s just a matter of testing and scaling the technology. BMW is already working on it.
These solid-state cells offer far lower internal resistance than their liquid-electrolyte counterparts, which means lower heating under load. Reduced cooling requirements will simplify pack construction considerably, lowering costs. For reference, the Hummer EV’s roughly 3,000-lb battery pack is an absolute monster, but only around 1,730 pounds of it is actually the battery cells. The rest is cooling passages, electronics, and structural components.
At right around 212 kilowatt-hours, it contains a ton of energy, but if it was full of SSBs, it would be an entirely different beast. Multiple solid-state manufacturers report energy densities in the range of 390 watt-hours per kilogram. Replace the conventional lithium-ion cells in the Hummer, and you would get a 306-kWh pack. An increase in energy of nearly one-third, just by swapping cells.
Power electronics are also making big progress. Many inverters currently use insulated gate bipolar transistors, commonly referred to as IGBTs. They work, but the industry already knows that silicon carbide and gallium nitride are the future for electric vehicles large and small. Major automakers have either already adopted Silicon Carbide or are in the process of doing so.
The switch to Silicon Carbide increases the efficiency of inverters, allowing for greater range. Likewise, while gallium nitride is currently used for lower-power applications like DC-DC converters, (i.e, the devices that take high battery voltage down to 5-12 volts for in-car accessories), they are already being prototyped into full-sized traction inverters, which promises to reduce the size, cost, and complexity of these devices. Power transistors that used to be the size of a quarter are being replaced by more efficient units the size of a grain of rice.
If none of the latter two technological advances are enough, electric motors themselves are simultaneously becoming lighter, smaller, and more powerful. Axial flux motors are already in low-volume production cars from McLaren, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Mercedes-Benz, Lamborghini, and more. These are real motors capable of providing a passenger car with adequate power despite hilariously low mass. A 300-horsepower car in the near future could be powered by an electric motor that weighs less than your average watermelon. These are motors being developed right now by the industry leader, YASA.
Drive units will shrink to sizes that are going to seem legitimately funny. Batteries that already exist are offering nearly 400 wh/kg. This newfound energy isn’t just a drop-in, though. It’s set to be used more efficiently than ever. None of these technologies are impossible, they are inevitable. In small volumes, all of these technologies already exist. We must simply wait for mass-market adoption.
Once you learn just a little bit about this stuff, once you get a passing familiarity with MOSFETs, or battery cells, or electric motors, you begin to understand just how amazing the next few years will be. Our current era of EVs will look stone-aged in hindsight. When we’re all commuting in fully electric or hybrid cars featuring these amazing advancements, we’ll have learned once again, never to bet against progress.

This Million-Dollar Motorhome Can Charge Your EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/730446/million-dollar-motorhome-charge-ev/,"It's got three televisions, two bathrooms, two kitchens, and a built-in Level 2 charger.",12/25/2024 8:51,"It's been a minute since we checked out a proper luxury motorhome. This isn't some RV with shiny hardware and wood trim, either. Prevost is known for having some of the most luxurious rigs on the market, and this Loki Coach doesn't disappoint ... so long as you can afford the $2.5-million price tag.
What does a multi-million-dollar motorhome look like? We get a tour from Erik Van Conover on YouTube, who spent time with the RV at this year's Canadian Grand Prix. For starters, the front seats alone are $20,000 each. Push a button on one of ten tablets mounted through the interior and a 65-inch TV drops down from the roof. Another button will raise a 50-inch TV in the master bedroom. And while you're relaxing outside, a 55-inch screen slides out from one of many exterior compartments. If you can't see the racing action live, there's no excuse for missing it on TV.
The living area stretches out with help from two slide-outs, making room for multiple sofas, including one that opens to a bed. The kitchen features a powered table that can stow for more space, and you can't possibly survive without a built-in dishwasher. For that matter, there's a stackable washer/dryer in the kitchen area, too. You'll also find the first of two bathrooms here, tucked neatly across from the pantry. As for all the drawers and cabinets, they're equipped with electromagnetic locks that automatically engage when driving.
There's a king-size bed and a second bathroom at the back, complete with a shower large enough for a bench. A door effectively seals this area from the rest of the RV for privacy. That's also accomplished with privacy glass or full-on shades, all power-operated of course.
Speaking of power, this RV needs a lot of it. The roof is covered in solar panels, and it carries enough lithium batteries to power the multiple air conditioning units for days. When more power is needed, the Loki's diesel engine is set up to charge the batteries. That also means there's enough juice to power a Level 2 EV charger. You'll have to flat-tow or drive the car separately though. Between the exterior kitchen, television, cargo areas, electronics, battery banks, and plumbing for the water system, there isn't room for a garage. Bummer.

2025 Lamborghini Temerario: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/730034/lamborghini-temerario-horsepower-engine-price-details/,"The Huracan’s replacement has 920 horsepower, three electric motors, and a V-8 with a ridiculous 10,000 rpm redline.",12/25/2024 8:51,"The Lamborghini Huracán is gone, which means its lovely naturally aspirated V-10 engine is dead, too. But fans of fast Lamborghinis need not worry, there’s a new super sports car from Sant'Agata Bolognese that promises to be even more thrilling: Meet the Lamborghini Temerario.
Lamborghini calls the Temerario a High-Performance Electrified Vehicle—or, HPEV—and it packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 plug-in hybrid setup with three electric motors. Total output is 920 horsepower, and it takes the Temerario just 2.7 seconds to reach 62 miles per hour. Top speed is 211 miles per hour.
Lamborghini built this new V-8 engine from the ground up. It has a 90-degree ""Hot V"" configuration and a flat-plane crankshaft, with two turbochargers running a maximum pressure of 36 psi. Cast aluminum alloy cylinder heads and titanium connecting rods help keep the weight down, while Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers in the valvetrain ensure the engine can spin up to 10,000 rpm.
Three oil-cooled, axial-flux electric motors join the V-8. Lamborghini stuck the rear motor between the engine and the transversely mounted eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. That electric motor alone produces up to 150 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque. The other two motors, located on the front axle, drive the front wheels and make 82 hp each. Yes, this new Lambo is all-wheel drive—but don't worry, there is a ""Drift Mode"" function that deploys torque at the rear wheels at three varying power levels. The Temerario also has a launch control function.
The battery pack has a capacity of 3.8 kilowatt hours. Plug the Temerario into a traditional AC charging port with up to 7 kilowatts of power, and the battery will recharge in 30 minutes. It can also be recharged through regenerative braking, or directly from the V-8 in as little as 6 minutes. You can drive using the front electric motors exclusively, but Lamborghini doesn't list an EV driving range for the Temerario.
Visually, the Temerario looks like a mix of the larger Revuelto and the outgoing Huracán. The headlights take up a small sliver of each corner of the hood—they’re slimmer even than the Huracán’s—and trendy hexagonal LED running lights sit just beneath them on each side of the front bumper. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fiber options.
In profile, the Temerario isn’t as sleek as the Huracán. It introduces a larger aerodynamic vent just ahead of the rear wheels that improves downforce by 103% compared to the Huracán Evo.
The Temerario Alleggerita lightweight package—with a larger rear wing, unique bumper treatments, and carbon fiber rims—debuts at launch and touts a 158% increase in downforce over the Huracán Evo, and a 55-pound weight reduction over the standard Temerario. Tack on the Carbon Pack, and that drops another 4 pounds through the use of carbon on the rear diffuser, mirror caps, and side air intakes.
Underneath the skin is a new lightweight chassis. Instead of the Huracán’s mixed aluminum and carbon-fiber build, the Temerario’s chassis is entirely aluminum. That yields a 50% drop in material use, 80% fewer heat-welded joints, and a 20% increase in torsional rigidity. It also helps keep the weight down.
Inside, the Tememerario has a cockpit-style cabin littered with hexagonal elements. Headroom improves by 1.3 inches over Huracán, and legroom improves by up to 1.8 inches. Even a 6-foot 6-inch NBA player could wear a helmet in this car, says Lamborghini.
An 8.4-inch vertical touchscreen graces the center of the dash, while the driver has access to a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and the passenger has a slightly smaller 9.1-inch touchscreen display.
One thing we don’t know yet is how much the Lamborghini Temerario costs. The outgoing Huracán Evo started at around $300,000 in the US, so it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility that the Temerario costs around $400,000 or even $500,000. We’ll know more about the Lamborghini Temerario when it goes on sale later this year or early in 2025.

The Rimac Nevera R Is Here. Its Specs Are Unbelievable,https://www.motor1.com/news/730067/rimac-nevera-r-revealed/,The Nevera R ditches the pretense of being a GT and becomes an all-out sports car. 0-60 mph takes 1.74 seconds.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Nobody has ever looked at the performance of a Rimac Nevera and thought “huh, maybe they’re holding back a bit.” But according to Rimac, the Nevera is a GT that happens to break records, not an all-out performance car. There was always more on the table, and now its being shown. Welcome to the 2,107 horsepower, 256 mile-per-hour, lowered, lightened, and wing-adorned Rimac Nevera R.
The Nevera R has all the typical stuff you'd expect from a hardcore track star—it’s lighter, more powerful, and more focused. Taking the bones of the Nevera meant that the R already had a spec sheet to end all spec sheets, but Rimac turned the wick up significantly. An extra 193 hp, a next-generation 108 kWh battery pack, and an undisclosed amount of weight reduction turn the Nevera R’s acceleration numbers comical. 0-60 mph takes just 1.74 seconds, 0-124 mph is an even more absurd 4.38 seconds, about as fast as a typical performance car’s 0-60 time. The most unbelievable numbers are the ¼ mile and 0-186 mph time. While it takes just 8.23 seconds to clear 1,320 feet, it takes just a little longer at 8.66 seconds for the Nevera R to reach 186 mph. It’s only the second street car in the 2,000 horsepower club after the Koenigsegg Gemera.
Acceleration is not the full story, however. In preparation to go record-smashing, the Nevera R also sees handling-focused upgrades. The new aero package includes a fixed wing, large diffuser, and a deeper front lip. The tires are now Michelin Cup 2s as standard, combined with more camber to produce more lateral traction. The All-Wheel Torque Vectoring program was retuned to take advantage of the extra mechanical and aero grip, while the steering system was refined for better response. Finally, a new generation of carbon ceramic brakes feature a silicone matrix layer to improve overall performance.
All said, the changes are good for a 3.8-second quicker lap time around the Nardo Handling Track. Dissecting that: The Nardo Handling Track is 3.8 miles long with a 0.6-mile long straightaway, which means the Nevera R is one second faster per mile of track. If that logic stands for the Nürburgring, then the Nevera R is almost certain to break the seven-minute barrier handily, and possibly take the challenge to the overall record holders. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Acura Confirms 'NSX-Type' EV Headed to Production,https://www.motor1.com/news/730443/electric-acura-nsx-confirmed/,"The car will be based on Honda's 0 Series electric platform, and debut in 2027 or 2028.",12/25/2024 8:51,"After years of rumors, Acura finally confirmed plans to build an ""NSX-type"" EV.
""We are going to introduce a [new] sports model in 2027 or 2028,"" global executive vice president Shinji Aoyama told a group of journalists, including Motor1, during a roundtable interview at Monterey Car Week.
""We may not call it an NSX, but it's kind of an NSX-type of vehicle,"" Aoyama added.
He went on to say the car would ride on Honda's new 0 (Zero) Series electric architecture, which will underpin its first electric sedan set to launch in 2026.
A third-generation NSX has been rumored since 2021, when Acura vice president and brand officer Jon Ikeda said in an interview that ""there's gonna be another NSX.""
""Our development approach for this new 0 Series [car] is thin and light,"" Aoyama said. ""So this means, basically, how to make the platform thinner than other existing vehicles. So even [with battery dimensions], we are trying to make a thinner vehicle. So that we can realize a lower-height vehicle. This means that we can realize a larger [cabin], as well.""
An all-electric NSX would have big shoes to fill. The last version, which ended production in 2022, used a twin-turbo V-6 and three electric motors to make a combined 600 horsepower (in Type S form). It looked great and handled well, able to take the fight to contemporaries like the McLaren 650S, Lamborghini Huracán, and Ferrari 488.
While straight-line speed won't be a problem for the NSX(ish) EV, handling and track endurance remain a question mark for even the most expensive electric supercars on the market today. Plus there's the issue of sound. The second-gen NSX's V-6 doesn't exactly ignite the soul, but it sounds a whole lot more appealing than the whir of a few electric motors. We'll just have to wait until 2027 to find out what Honda has in store.

"Pininfarina Battista Loses Its Roof, Instantly Gets Cooler",https://www.motor1.com/news/730211/pininfarina-battista-targamerica/,Pininfarina's electric hypercar becomes a targa for this one-off.,12/25/2024 8:51,"The Italians do convertibles so well. For further evidence, see this, the Pininfarina Battista Targamerica, an open-top version of the electric hypercar, which makes its debut Thursday for Monterey Car week.
The Targamerica is a coach-built one-off for a special Pininfarina client who already owns a Battista coupe. It's not the first convertible from the modern Automobili Pininfarina—that would be the B95 Speedster—but it is the first open-top Battista. It makes you wonder why the Battista wasn't a convertible to begin with.
Remarkably, it took just a year for the Targamerica to go from conception to reality, with the client comissioning the car at Monterey Car Week last year. Its silver-with-blue-accents livery pays homage to another one-off Pininfarina convertible, the Ferrari Testarossa Spider made for longtime Fiat scion Gianni Angelli in 1986. The rear decklid is unique to the Targamerica, too, as are the doors, which in the coupe are integrated into the roof. Another notable feature is a cigar humidor integrated between the seats. Apparently the client likes their stogies.
Pininfarina Battista Targamerica
As a brief reminder, the Battista is the creation of Automobili Pininfarina, a German-headquartered offshoot of the legendary Italian design house, owned by India's Mahindra. The Battista is based on the Rimac Nevera hypercar, and offers an astonishing 1,900 horsepower from its four electric motors.
Automobili Pininfarina is showing the Targamerica at The Quail on Friday, after which point the client will take delivery. The automaker didn't say whether it'll build more Battista convertibles, we suspect this won't be the last.

The UAW Files Labor Charges Against Elon Musk And Donald Trump,https://www.motor1.com/news/730039/uaw-labor-charges-donald-trump-elon-musk/,"UAW President Shawn Fain says that Musk and Trump attempted to ""threaten and intimidate"" workers.",12/25/2024 8:51,"The United Auto Workers (UAW) is filing federal labor charges against Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former president Donald Trump. During a joint conference on Monday evening on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the UAW said that Musk and Trump used language meant to ""threaten and intimidate"" workers.
""You're the greatest cutter,"" Trump said to Musk during the two-hour conversation. ""I look at what you do. You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike."" Trump continued, ""I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'""
The UAW notes that it is illegal to fire workers under federal labor law while it is also illegal to threaten workers who plan to strike under the National Labor Relations Act. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement that this type of language against workers is ""disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns.""
The UAW and President Shawn Fain have been critical of Trump recently. Fain noted in a video on Monday that, “Donald Trump is all talk, but Kamala Harris has delivered for auto workers.” In that same video, the UAW endorsed Kamala Harris for President of the United States.

"The Charger EV Doesn't Have Fake Shifting, And That Kind Of Sucks",https://www.motor1.com/news/729684/dodge-charger-ev-drifts-donuts-acceleration-video/,"Dodge has revealed a whole lot more info about its Fratzonic ""exhaust"" system. And it's missing one big feature.",12/25/2024 8:51,"Dodge has released a whole lot of new information about the synthetic ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" system on its newest car, the Charger Daytona EV. The company has also published a video showing off the car doing donuts and acceleration pulls, complete with audio.
The Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust uses a custom enclosure mounted in the rear lower fascia of the Charger EV, paired with a dedicated amplifier that can produce up to 600 watts of power. Like most performance-minded EV noises, the exhaust uses input from the driver and the car to adjust sound and volume.
Specifically, the Fratzonic exhaust uses inputs like acceleration and deceleration, and makes noises when the car turns on and off. You can even ""rev"" the Charger EV, or just listen to it idle like any gas-powered car. It'll also make a distinct noise if you use the ""PowerShot"" function, which adds 40 horsepower for up to 15 seconds with the push of a button.
A two-minute video released by Dodge shows a Charger Daytona Scat Pack accelerating past a camera before pulling off a smoky donut. After that, we get a few seconds of the car ""idling."" It sounds like a real V-8 to us, but obviously, it's all still fake.
What we don't hear, strangely, are any simulated gears shifting. After Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, we suspected every performance EV going forward would have a feature like that, as it enhances the driving experience exponentially, and gives purpose to all of the synthetic noises. A Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 the Charger does not have any feature of the sort.
So even if you do enjoy the nice V-8 burble from the Charger EV, there's no way to bang through gears or bounce off a ""redline."" It's like pairing a Hemi to a CVT. And that sounds like no fun at all.
Are you a fan of the Fratzonic exhaust? Do you think Dodge made the right call not including fake gears? Let us know in the comments.

Acura's Next EV Will Be A Performance SUV,https://www.motor1.com/news/729536/acura-electric-suv-teaser/,And it may have its own dedicated EV platform.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Last year at The Quail in Monterey, Acura showed off its sharp ZDX electric SUV for the first time. And it teased an electric sports car ripe with NSX cues. This year, though, the company has another electric vehicle taking center stage in Monterey—but for now, much of it remains a mystery.
A single teaser image previews the back end of what looks like a pretty sleek vehicle. The taillight design is unique; it forgoes the typical triangular taillights found on most current Acura models for a flowy light bar that extends the width of the trunk lid. An Acura wordmark sits just underneath it, and the vehicle wears a blue paint job.
Acura confirmed this will be the automaker’s first SUV built in Ohio using the company's new dedicated EV platform. So, it sounds like no Ultium underneath. This likely won’t be the subcompact ADX, so our next best guess is something on the ultra-premium side—maybe even an SUV ""coupe,"" something currently missing from the brand’s lineup. Acura uses the word ""performance"" to describe the concept, and says it previews a ""segment-defying sport utility vehicle.""
Details beyond that are pretty slim. But, we’ll know exactly what this concept is when Monterey Car Week kicks off beginning on Monday, August 12. Acura will display this concept on the lawn at The Quail on Friday, August 16. We’ll be there—so stay tuned for more details.

Nissan's New Paint Uses Electromagnetic Waves To Keep Temperatures Down,https://www.motor1.com/news/729520/nissan-paint-electromagnetic-waves-temperatures/,"It's in the testing phase, but early results show a significant drop in both surface and interior temperatures for cars.",12/25/2024 8:51,"If you think there's too much tech in cars, just wait until you see this. Nissan is working on a new type of exterior automotive paint that uses electromagnetic waves to keep both the surface and interior cooler. It's still in the testing phase, but preliminary results look very promising.
The automaker is working with Radi-Cool, a company that specializes in cooling products. Radiative paint like this isn't a new concept—it's been used on buildings for years to help keep people and things cooler inside. But as Nissan explains, those applications call for a very thick paint that doesn't have the same durability or shine of an automotive finish. Among other things, it's applied with a roller. And while we've seen people paint cars with rollers, it's not an ideal method for bringing color to your car.
This new formula is designed for use in spray guns and it works with clear topcoats. It's still a thick paint though—six times thicker than a standard automotive finish. Within the mix are two microstructure components that contribute to its cooling ability. The first is designed to reflect near-infrared rays, a common way to keep the heat down. The second component is where the scientific magic happens. It creates electromagnetic waves that don't reflect the sun's rays but actually counteract them. It helps prevent heat transfer to other parts of the car.
""My dream is to create cooler cars without consuming energy"" explained Dr. Susumu Miura, the senior manager of this project. ""This is especially important in the EV era, where the load from running air-conditioning in summer can have a sizable impact on the state of charge,"" he said.
Nissan doesn't explain the intricacies of the paint or how the electromagnetic waves are generated, but the results are pretty conclusive. Comparisons show a temperature drop of 12 degrees Celsius on cars wearing the special finish. That's a measurement of the exterior surface, but the interior was also cooler by 5 degrees Celsius.
So, when can you order a new Z or a Rogue with the ""cool"" paint job? Development is ongoing; among other things, Nissan would like to make the paint even thinner for easier applications. If it does end up in production, it will likely be reserved for special-order vehicles.

"The Dodge Charger EV's Frunk Is Optional, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/729505/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-frunk-optional/,"If you want a little extra storage in your Charger Daytona EV, you'll need to go for a pricey option package.",12/25/2024 8:51,"We noticed a curious detail in the press release announcing pricing for the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV. One of the features listed with the $4,995 Plus Group is, simply, ""Frunk."" Wait. Does this mean the front trunk is optional?
Indeed it does, a Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 yesterday.
Bizarrely, Dodge isn't the first to do this. At least in the U.K., the new Audi Q6 E-Tron's frunk is a £500 a-la-carte option. (Audi is yet to release packaging information on the U.S.-spec Q6 E-Tron.) But to the best of our recollection, that's the only other instance of this, EV or otherwise. In the Charger Daytona EV, it's not huge—a video from TFLEV notes it offers 1.5 cubic feet of storage—but it's enough for charging cables and other smaller items.
The Plus Group adds a number of other features to the Charger Daytona including cooled seats, LED lighting, a power rear hatch, wireless phone charging, 20 inch wheels for the base R/T model, and more. Still, this appears to be an odd bit of cost cutting—not including a simple piece of molded plastic under the hood as standard. But, the new Charger Daytona surely won't be as abundantly profitable as the old gas-powered Charger and Challenger, so Dodge has to find ways to eke out margins where it can.
The Charger Daytona is expensive as it is, too. Base price for the R/T is $61,950 and that rises to $75,185 for the Scat Pack, though both do qualify for a $7,500 tax credit when leased. Dodge may yet come out with cheaper models, though. A Dodge spokesperson tells us that ""[f]uture model years will see the Charger Daytona lineup expand to cover a larger portion of the muscle car segment.""

The Latest Rolls-Royce One-Off Is An Extremely Yellow Spectre,https://www.motor1.com/news/729067/rolls-royce-spectre-semaphore/,The Spectre Semaphore gets its own unique paint and a trippy two-tone hood.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Rolls-Royce is bringing something special to Monterey this year. This very yellow coupe is called the Spectre Semaphore, a one-off special build that wears a handful of bespoke customizations, including a trippy paint job for the hood and a very bright two-tone interior.
The flashy hue is called Semaphore Yellow, a color crafted specifically for this commission, says Rolls. On the hood is a unique artwork dubbed ""Marble Paint Spill."" Inspired by Californian artists, it's a collection of silver lacquer and multiple layers of clear coat to create what looks like a pool of mixed yellow and silver paint. Rolls-Royce says the hood alone required 160 hours of labor to design and produce.
Sticking with the very yellow color scheme, the interior of the Spectre Semaphore uses a combination of Lemon Yellow and Citrine Yellow to brighten the white seats, doors, and dashboard trim. Wrapping things together is Lemon Yellow stitching, naturally. Rolls was even able to make the center dial in the gauge cluster yellow.
There's no mention of drivetrain changes, meaning the Spectre Semaphore's dual-motor electric drivetrain is likely untouched. It's rated at a combined 577 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque from the factory, with up to 291 miles of range.
Rolls describes the Semaphore as capturing ""the bold new codes of luxury being established by the marque’s confident, youthful client base.""
Into the design? You're in luck. Unlike most bespoke commissions from the brand, this one hasn't been pre-sold. Rolls says it's available to purchase through any authorized dealer in the United States. Though presumably, you'll have to act fast since this is the only one that exists.
The one-off Spectre will make its debut at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering, on August 16 during Monterey Car Week.

Dodge's New EV 'Exhaust' Sounds Way Better Than We Expected,https://www.motor1.com/news/729243/dodge-charger-ev-new-v8-sound/,"It might not be a real V-8, but it's pretty convincing.",12/25/2024 8:51,"Dodge's new all-electric Charger is shrouded in controversy. Not only is the Hemi V-8 gone, but it's been replaced with a fake ""Fratzonic"" exhaust sound that doesn't have the internet convinced. The latest version of the sound, revealed this week, should convince at least a few people, though.
The company published a video to Instagram on Monday showing off the latest iteration of the Fratzonic exhaust. We watch and listen as a Charger Daytona EV blasts through a tunnel, outputting what sounds like a good old-fashioned V-8 sound.
The sound is a far cry from the original noise out of the debut in 2022, which was met with a ton of hate. In 2023, Dodge went as far as to change the sound with something resembling an engine, which sounded better but seemingly failed to convince the buying public. And while this latest noise sounds almost exactly like a real V-8, the internet isn't buying it.
""Lol we want real V-8 noises ... not a speaker,"" one comment reads. ""We still want HEMIs,"" says another. ""I’d rather have no car than one of these,"" one commenter says.
Dodge has voiced its struggles with the Fratzonic exhaust since its original reveal. ""We've changed it 100 times,"" CEO Tim Kuniskis confessed to reporters back in March. The system uses a speaker (or speakers) mounted inside an exhaust-like chamber to mimic the sound of a real exhaust.
Judging by the public's reaction to this whole fake exhaust speaker thing, it's clear that people don't actually care whether an electric car sounds like an ICE-powered car or not. Even if the Charger Daytona EV sounds exactly like a Hellcat, people won't be convinced, because they'll know it's not the real thing.
It's like slapping an M badge on a non-M BMW. The only people that care about the badge will also know it's a fake. Likewise, anyone that cares about the exhaust sound coming from a Charger EV will know it's not the real thing.

VW Claims the Electric GTI Will Be More Fun To Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/729001/vw-electric-gti-more-fun-drive/,Volkswagen boss touts superior chassis and suspension compared to the gas GTI.,12/25/2024 8:51,"It’s been nearly a year since Volkswagen signaled its intention to do an electric GTI. The ID. GTI Concept will evolve into a production model in 2026 for the European market. VW wants the hot hatch in the United States at a $25,000 price point but it's only wishful thinking at this point. Meanwhile, our colleagues at Motor1 Italy had a chat with the big boss in Wolfsburg about the first GTI without a combustion engine.
Thomas Schäfer didn't miss the occasion to hype up the electric GTI, saying its suspension and chassis ""will be at an even higher level"" compared to the gas model on sale today. The goal is ""to produce a car that isn't just about performance"" but one that's ""even more exciting to experience and drive."" The high-ranked official from VW also mentioned the car will have a ""GTI e-sound,"" so expect artificial engine noise to be pumped through the speakers.
It's worth noting the ID. GTI Concept did not preview an electric Golf GTI but rather a smaller car. The performance-oriented show car from last year's IAA Mobility in Munich was based on the ID. 2all, a Polo-sized electric hatchback. The supermini is still sold in Europe as a GTI with a combustion engine, a 2.0-liter turbo four-pot making 204 horsepower. Before its demise in 2023, the even smaller up! GTI was still offered with a turbo three-cylinder 1.0-liter engine rated at 115 hp.
Another all-electric Golf after the Mk7-based model isn't due until closer to the end of the decade when the Mk9 is scheduled to come out. The current Mk8 Golf with gas engines might live to see 2035 as VW isn't ruling out selling two generations concomitantly for several years. The Golf turns 50 this year and the GTI will reach the same milestone in 2025.
Technically, the Scirocco GTI was the first GTI to hit the assembly line. It entered series production in the summer of 1976 while the Golf GTI followed later that fall. However, VW took the wraps off the first Golf GTI at the 1975 IAA show in Frankfurt.
Speaking at the GTI Fan Fest in Wolfsburg, Schäfer told Motor1 Italy that VW can transfer the ""DNA spirit [of the gasoline GTI] into the electric age."" He went on to say the GTIs that will eschew ICE power will deliver ""high performance and iconic design"" while remaining instantly recognizable. Those three iconic letters stand for Grand Touring Injection but a logo trademark from last year indicated the ""I"" will be replaced by a lightning bolt for the performance EVs.
During the same interview, VW's head honcho reiterated the German automaker still wants electric cars to account for at least 80 percent of annual sales in Europe by 2030. VW Group luxury brands such as Bentley, Porsche, and Audi have recently revised their EV goals, admitting gas cars are likely to stick around for longer than originally estimated.",Adrian Padeanu
The A6 E-Tron Is Audi's First Rear-Wheel Drive Sedan In A Century,https://www.motor1.com/news/728466/audi-a6-e-tron-rwd/,"No, really. To find another rear-drive Audi sedan, you have to go back before the War.",12/25/2024 8:51,"A rear-wheel drive sedan isn't abnormal, but one with Audi's four rings on the front? That is very, very unusual. But believe it or not, the base Audi A6 E-Tron—the new electric version of Audi's longstanding mid-size sedan—drives just its rear wheels.
Audi is, of course, a brand defined by its Quattro all-wheel drive system, but it built front-wheel drive cars for much of its history. You have to go all the way back to the Audi 920 of the late 1930s to find an earlier rear-wheel drive Audi sedan than this new A6. And for all of its modern history, the company has only built front or all-wheel drive cars. The only exceptions are the rear-wheel drive versions of the R8 supercar and the base Q4 E-Tron crossover.
Quick history lesson: Audi was formed around the turn of the 20th century, and in 1932, it became part of the Auto Union along with fellow German companies Horch, Wanderer, and DKW. Hence the four rings of the Audi logo. After the War, the Audi name was dropped until the mid-1960s, when Auto Union revived it in favor of DKW.
Most modern Audis can trace their lineage to the DKW F9, which was designed in the early days of World War II as a successor to the Volkswagen Beetle. As an excellent video from the B Sport YouTube channel explains, Auto Union ran with the F9's drivetrain layout of a longitudinal engine ahead of a transmission sending power to the front wheels. In gas-powered cars larger than the A3, it's the layout Audi still uses to this day, albeit often with the addition of a driveshaft going to the rear in the classic Quattro all-wheel drive system. This includes the A6 and all its predecessors.
All of this is to say that there are decades of tradition here, which the A6 E-Tron breaks with. Of course, many single-motor EVs are rear-wheel drive for a variety of reasons, so on some level, it's not that unusual. Plus, the A6's rivals—the Tesla Model S, BMW i5, and Mercedes EQE—are all rear-wheel drive in base form. Still, it's astonishing that this is the first modern, rear-wheel-drive Audi sedan.
Going electric changes everything. This break from tradition doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things, yet it's certainly notable given Audi's history. But, a rear-wheel drive sedan is almost always a good thing, so the base A6 E-Tron might be a sweet spot in the Audi range.

Honda-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Reportedly Planned,https://www.motor1.com/news/728183/honda-nissan-mitsubishi-alliance/,Honda and Nissan are already working together and it looks as though Mitsubishi is about to join them.,12/25/2024 8:51,"These are challenging times for automakers. Competition has never been so fierce, fueled by the rise of Chinese car manufacturers who have a head start in the EV race. Add increasingly stricter emissions regulations, and you get the perfect storm. To cope with all the hurdles ahead, some of the biggest names in the industry are joining forces. The recently formed Honda-Nissan alliance could welcome a third player: Mitsubishi.
Nikkei Asia reports that Mitsubishi allegedly wants to join the existing deal between Honda and Nissan. Per the initial agreement announced in mid-March, the collaboration focuses on ""automotive software platforms, core components related to EVs, and complementary products."" Seeing this third Japanese brand join the alliance would make sense, considering Nissan has a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
The report states that Mitsubishi has already signed an NDA with Honda and Nissan to kick off discussions about a wider tie-up. Shortly after the report emerged, shares in Mitsubishi rose by 6.3 percent, according to Reuters. Nissan also saw an increase of 2.8 percent, while Honda gained 2.6 percent.
The three companies working together would reduce R&D costs and speed up development, better fending off Chinese competition. However, final details about the alliance haven't been disclosed. It's worth noting that Nissan and Mitsubishi have been working together with Renault since 1999.
A collaboration between Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi would not be the first Japanese trio formed this year. A few months ago, Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru teamed up to develop a new generation of combustion engines. This next wave of ICEs will focus on hybrid powertrains and compatibility with carbon-neutral fuels. Toyota is preparing several inline-fours, Mazda is enhancing its rotary technology for range-extended EVs, and Subaru is refining its signature boxer engine.
Being the naive person that I am, it would be great for Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi to jointly work on an affordable sports car. Nissan did recently hint about bringing back the Silvia one day. However, this alliance seems to be about less exciting things such as software and EVs. Nikkei Asia reports that plug-in hybrids and kei cars could also be common goals. At the end of the day, it's all about cutting costs, and it's difficult to make profitable sports cars.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Vs. Mercedes-AMG GT: It's Not Even Close,https://www.motor1.com/news/727902/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-races-amg-gt/,The electric crossover is turning out to be a performance bargain.,12/25/2024 8:51,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is proving to be a formidable drag racer. The little electric crossover recently shamed several high-end, high-powered SUVs, including a Lamborghini Urus and a Brabus-tuned Mercedes-AMG G63. It's now unleashed its fury on a more appropriate opponent—the Mercedes-AMG GT.
The coupe has AMG’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine under the hood, which delivers 585 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels. The Hyundai has two electric motors that give it all-wheel drive, together producing 650 hp and 545 lb-ft of twist. The AMG has a weight advantage, weighing about 298 pounds less than the electric crossover.
The Hyundai is a quick family hauler. It beat the coupe off the line in the first run and stayed ahead past the finish line. The GT got a much better start in the second race, launching ahead of the 5 N, but the EV reeled in the AMG and beat it by a bumper to the finish line. Both cars completed the quarter-mile race in 11.4 seconds—impressive for a $66,000 electric family crossover that can create fake gearshifts and corresponding exhaust sounds.
The Ioniq also has a few software tricks that were deployed during the rolling races. The EV’s fake gear shifts didn’t help it against the AMG, losing by quite a gap. However, a simple setting change and a press of the boost button in the Ioniq made the second run a completely different race, with the Hyundai leaving the Mercedes behind.
We live in a wild time when reasonably priced Hyundai crossovers outperform six-figure sports cars in a straight line, but that’s the big benefit battery-electric vehicles offer. They democratize horsepower, and it feels like the 5 N is just the beginning of a new age of performance cars that could alter the automotive hierarchy built on combustion power.

"The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance Is Grand Touring, Perfected",https://www.motor1.com/reviews/727478/2025-mercedes-amg-gt63-s-e-performance-review/,Adding hybrid power leans the GT63 farther into its new cross-country personality. And the car is all the better for it.,12/25/2024 8:51,"The new Mercedes-AMG GT isn’t the sports car it used to be. These days, the V-8-powered two-door from Affalterbach is more of a grand tourer, with a roomier interior and a wider range of capabilities thanks to standard all-wheel drive, which comes at the cost of added weight. While it’s not as driver-focused as the previous car, the new GT does the cross-country missile thing very well.
The AMG GT63 S E Performance, a new hybrid variant that uses a trick rear-mounted electric motor to add even more power and tech, doubles down on that ethos. With a combined 805 horsepower and 1,047 pound-feet of torque, it’s leagues quicker than the standard car and packed with a whole bunch of fun hybrid tech, adding another layer of complexity to an already complex car.
The E Performance is, in many ways, very similar to the standard GT63. It looks identical, with no changes to the sleek, long-nose body and menacing front end. The carbon-ceramic brakes are the same, the Michelin Pilot S5 tires are the same, and the aero goes largely untouched. The interior is lifted from the pure ICE car, with its gigantic touchscreen control center, digital gauge cluster, and infuriating touch-sensitive controls. If you want an in-depth explanation on why I hate controls like this, read my review of the GT63. In short, they feel like cost-cutting measures that are worse to use versus physical buttons and switchgear.
All of the real changes happen beneath this AMG’s skin. In place of a regular rear differential sits a 201-horsepower electric motor directly on the rear axle using two forward gears. Combined with AMG’s magnificent 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8—making 603 hp in this application—it turns an immensely quick vehicle into the fastest-accelerating gas car I’ve ever driven.
Mercedes claims a 0-60 mph time of 2.7 seconds, making it even quicker than the AMG One hypercar. But the E Performance feels quicker than that number suggests. Where you’d get a slight delay between throttle push and forward thrust in the standard car, here there’s instant gratification. Low-speed response is truly immediate thanks to the e-motor, like you’d find on something purely electric. The biggest surprise doesn’t come at 60 mph, though. It comes at 160.
With free reign of Germany's Autobahn (where there are no speed limits), I'm able to explore the E Performance's explosive acceleration. That electric motor doesn’t just help the car accelerate at low speeds. It helps everywhere. That same gut-punch of electric shove you feel at normal speeds? You also feel it deep into triple digits. Having that kind of immediate forward momentum available at 150-plus-mph is a mind-bending sensation. This is probably what it’s like to drive a Bugatti.
Top speed for the GT63 E Performance is electronically limited to 199 mph. That’s just barely better than the normal GT63’s top speed of 196 mph. Don’t let the numbers fool you, though. While I can see the normal car reaching true V-max at its quoted top speed, this hybrid version feels like it can keep pulling past 215 if the limiter were removed. It took me relatively no time at all to reach an indicated 192 mph on an empty stretch of German highway (the fastest I’ve ever driven a car, anywhere). It was still pulling hard when I had to let off. You’re paying for the way this car reaches these speeds in such a nonchalant, unfazed, and timely manner.
While the powertrain feels seamless from behind the wheel, it’s highly complex. The GT63 hybrid uses a similar setup to the bigger S63 E Performance sedan, with some modifications to the rear diff’s housing to get it to fit into the GT’s underside. The single permanent-magnet synchronous motor is powered by a 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery that lives in the trunk area, taking up a fair bit of what used to be a cavernous hatch. Thankfully the optional rear seats still fold down, so you’ll never be short of space when packing for two.
Because that e-motor is connected directly to the differential, it can actually send torque back up the driveshaft and to the transfer case, which in turn throws twist to the front wheels. That means even in Electric mode—one of eight(!) different drive modes in the E Performance—the car remains all-wheel drive. Of course, the transfer case is almost always sending all the power to the rear to improve vehicle dynamics. Up to 50 percent of the torque can make it to the front axle, but that only occurs in cases where traction is tough to come by, like snowy hills or slippery corner exits.
How that rear-mounted motor delivers its performance depends heavily on your selected drive mode. Keep the GT63 in a calmer mode like Slippery or Comfort, and the system will run the car on battery-only power when it can, only firing the V-8 when there’s demand for extra power—or to recharge using the belt-spun alternator-generator. Throw it into Sport or Race mode, and the engine remains permanently online, constantly topping off the battery via the alternator. This way, you’re never lacking for that instant thrust when you need it.
There’s also a Battery Hold mode which, as the name suggests, runs the E Performance on pure internal combustion power until the driver specifies otherwise. Engineers say the goal here is to deliver a “first- and last-mile” EV solution that allows owners to leave and enter their neighborhood in total silence before firing up that loud twin-turbo motor.
Alongside the drive modes are layers of driver customization tools, from suspension stiffness, to traction control, to aero adjustments, to augmented sound coming through the speakers. Some can be adjusted through the giant touchscreen or the left-hand half-moon screens on the steering wheel. Others, like the aggressiveness of the brake regen, are hidden inside the other screen on the steering wheel beyond the drive mode symbols. There’s even a drift mode that sends all the power to the rear, but it requires jumping through about 46 hoops to activate.
I spent around eight hours in this car over two days, and I was still finding new adjustments toward the end of my drive. You’d need weeks behind the wheel to be truly in-tune with all the tech this car has on offer. For people who like this kind of stuff: You’ll be entertained for months trying out all of the different combinations.
“[The GT63 S E Performance] is for the people who love technology and the engineering craftsmanship we have here at AMG,” head product manager Matthias Schmidt told Motor1. “They want to have the maximum power, that's the most important thing. This [car] is great for long distances but still delivers very good [cornering] performance.”
For those more interested in a pure driving experience, you might want to look elsewhere. All this hybrid stuff adds 496 pounds to the GT63’s already comically high curb weight, for a new grand total of 4,839 pounds. That’s more than a double-cab Toyota Tacoma.
While the extra poundage is easy to feel, the E Performance isn’t lacking in cornering speed. The steering is very quick and pleasantly smooth, helped by standard rear-steer and those excellent Michelins. This Mercedes possesses tons of poise through big and small bends alike, carrying tons of speed with little effort. That’s thanks in part to the standard AMG Active Ride, which forgoes traditional sway bars for a set of interconnected hydraulic lines that open and close depending on driving conditions, widening the range of damping for the uprights to deliver unprecedented performance for a car this heavy.
There’s also the improved weight distribution. Tobias Roll, head of product development for the SL and GT, told us the E Performance comes out to 51/49 front-to-rear versus 54/46 for the standard car, because of all the rear-mounted hybrid equipment. It’s tough to feel a difference in that balance without driving the two cars back to back, though, especially when both cars are already so heavy. You can have fun in this one, sure. But it’ll never be as joyful around a corner as something with half the weight and a quarter of the power. (Do that math and you won’t be surprised about which car fits those parameters.)
Corner carving isn’t what GT63 E Performance buyers are looking for. Those customers will go for the GT63 Pro, a trim made specifically for track work sporting more cooling and aero. The person who buys an E Performance buys it because it’s packed with the latest and greatest technological advancements you can find in a car. Because it has seemingly unlimited amounts of customization available. And most importantly, because it has the biggest number on the spec sheet.
That sheet will include the biggest price, too. While Mercedes has yet to release pricing, we expect the E Performance to start at around $216,000—or about $30,000 more than the standard car. As an all-around sports car, the Porsche 911 Turbo S is probably a better choice. But for ultimate high-speed highway domination and long-range grand touring, there’s nothing better on the market right now.

Mercedes Bricks The AMG One PHEV If The Engine Is Turned Off Prematurely,https://www.motor1.com/news/727380/amg-one-freezes-if-engine-prematurely-turned-off/,It happens if the V-6 is shut off six times in a row before it reaches the optimal temperature.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Putting an actual F1 engine in a street-legal hypercar was no easy feat for Mercedes-AMG, but they finally did it. The One hypercar was introduced in September 2017, and after many engineering hurdles, production started in August 2022. F1 champion Nico Rosberg ordered his in 2018 but had to wait six years to collect the car. A new video reminds us just how finicky this F1 car for the road really is.
You've probably heard the story about how the turbocharged 1.6-liter V-6 has to be rebuilt once every 31,000 miles. Well, there's more to it than that since the AMG One's startup procedure must be obeyed to the letter. Nico Rosberg made the mistake of shutting off the car prematurely before the engine reached its optimal temperature.
Had he done this six times in a row, Mercedes would have bricked the car, preventing him from using it again. Then what? A One owner would have to ring up Mercedes and ask someone from AMG to come with a laptop and unfreeze the car. Talk about first-world problems...
It takes 5-8 minutes for the combustion engine to reach optimal temperature if the car is stationary. Driving it around lowers the wait time to 2-5 minutes. It's worth noting the hypercar always starts in fully electric mode. The ICE doesn't kick in until the catalytic converter reaches 932°F, a process that takes anywhere from 60 to 90 seconds. During this time, the AMG One effectively behaves like an EV.
Once the combustion engine comes alive, the fastest production car around the Nürburgring becomes impressively loud. So much so that Mercedes-AMG delivers the hypercar with noise-canceling headphones because some might find the 120 decibels overwhelming. It was even louder during the development process but the engineers eventually managed to make it slightly more civilized. There's no fake engine sound being pumped through the speakers. It's all mechanical.
Mercedes-AMG CTO Jochen Hermann told Rosberg that getting the software right was the most challenging part of the lengthy development process. From previous statements made by company representatives, we learned that lowering the engine's idle speed from the F1 car's 5,000 rpm to 1,250 rpm was also a huge undertaking.
Hermann admitted the AMG One was the most complicated car to develop in the history of Mercedes and he believes it will never be replicated. The German brand has already ruled out doing another F1-powered road car ever again due to stricter emissions regulations. Only 275 units of the AMG One are being hand-built and Nico Rosberg is not the only F1 driver who signed his name on the dotted line. David Coulthard is also on the list.
As if the AMG One wasn't special enough already, Nico's has a black three-pointed star at the front that took 16 layers of paint, all of which were applied by hand.

Ford: EV Goals Were 'Too Ambitious' In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/727296/ford-ev-goals-too-ambitious-europe/,That means gas engines could stick around past 2030.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Over the last few years, Ford made an aggressive push to get more EVs on the road—as did many automakers. But as we've seen elsewhere, companies are starting to roll back EV plans as customer demand wanes. Ford is the latest to admit it might have been too aggressive in its EV push.
In an interview with Autocar, COO of Ford's Model E electrification division, Marin Gjaja, said that the company was overly ambitious with its EV plans in Europe. ""I think customers have voted, and they told us that was too ambitious,"" Gjaja noted. ""We don't see that going all-electric by 2030 [in Europe] is a good choice for our business or, especially, for our customers.""
2025 Ford Capri
Ford announced in 2021 that it had plans to make its entire European fleet electric by 2030, but this is the second report that recently surfaced suggesting Ford will slow those plans. In May, Ford of Europe's General Manager Martin Sander told Automotive News that gas engines could continue on past 2030. ""If we see strong demand, for instance for plug-in hybrid vehicles, we will offer them.""
In this case, Gjaja cites slowing EV adoption and rising costs as the main reasons for the recent rollback. Currently, Ford only sells two EVs in Europe: The Explorer EV and the Mustang Mach-E. The new Ford Capri will go on sale later this year.
Ford hasn’t made any statements regarding its EV plans in the US. But the company did recently announce that it will expand production of its Super Duty trucks in Canada—which will include a hybrid option—and we know that more hybrids and plug-ins hybrids aren’t off the table.

Watch The Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Conquer The Nurburgring,https://insideevs.com/news/727315/porsche-panamera-nurburgring/,"Porsche claimed a record as the fastest ""top-class"" sedan with a hybrid powertrain. Here's how it went.",7/21/2024 9:00,"The new Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid is a beast. With 771 horsepower from its hybrid powertrain, it's the most powerful Panamera you can buy. Porsche already sent it around the Nurburgring, lapping the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 24.17 seconds.
Now, we have a first-person perspective of the entire lap thanks to this in-car video recently published on YouTube.
Frankly, the lap doesn't look nearly as fast as it actually is. Porsche development driver and Nurburgring veteran Lars Kern appears borderline relaxed in the driver's seat as the scenery flashes by. There's very little drama, even on the fastest sections of the track. The Panamera reaches 173 mph heading into Schwedenkreuz, the infamous fast left-hander approximately two miles into the lap. We've seen many cars get skittish through here, but the Porsche remains remarkably composed.
For that matter, things stay composed even through the more demanding stretches of the loop. The back half after Karussell is nothing but fast turn after fast turn, and the Panamera doesn't flinch. Airing things out on the main straight, Kern gets the sedan to 190 mph—well short of its 202 mph top speed but enough to cement the 7:24 lap time. Again, it's all done with shockingly little drama.
Kern is certainly skilled behind the wheel, but credit also goes to a new aerodynamics package that pumps up downforce and the Active Ride chassis that manages pitch and roll, among other things. Aside from a racing seat and a roll cage for safety, the Panamera was completely showroom stock. That includes the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.
Porsche claims a record as the fastest ""top-class"" sedan with a hybrid powertrain. It's not the fastest sedan to lap the Nordschleife, but we suspect company executives are too upset by that. The all-electric Taycan Turbo GT holds that honor at 7 minutes, 7.55 seconds, set earlier this year. But given Porsche's fondness for Nurburgring records, we bet this isn't the last time we see a Panamera hustling around the storied race track.

This Is The Most Powerful Porsche Panamera Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/727030/most-powerful-porsche-panamera-ever/,The pricey Turbo S E-Hybrid arrives alongside a new GTS.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Days after setting a Nürburgring record, the hottest Panamera of them all is official. Porsche debuted the Turbo S E-Hybrid equipped with an electrified V-8 engine making serious power. Not only is it more potent than its predecessor but it also comes with a substantial battery upgrade. Sticky tires, a carbon fiber aero kit, and a rich list of standard equipment boost its appeal.
At the heart of the range-topper is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter engine making 591 horsepower. Built into the eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, the electric motor belts out another 187 hp. Together, the two deliver a combined 771 hp, lending the new Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid a substantial 81-hp advantage over the old model. At the same time, torque has jumped by 96 pound-feet to a mountain-moving 737 lb-ft.
Courtesy of the extra electrified muscle, the flagship Panamera is now two-tenths of a second quicker to 60 mph by completing the task in just 2.8 seconds. Flat out, it hits 202 mph, making it 8 mph faster than the old one. But wait, it gets even better. Porsche has increased the gross capacity of the battery pack by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, resulting in a higher electric range.
Sitting at the top of the food chain, the (takes a deep breath) Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid gets the good stuff as standard. The ceramic brakes are included from the get-go, as are the forged 21-inch centerlock wheels. There are still a few boxes on the options list you can tick, namely an aero kit and Michelin tires. The former increases downforce by 132 pounds at 124 mph while the latter is a bespoke Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber.
Porsche is already accepting orders and wants an eye-watering $228,495 before options. If that’s out of your price range, the Panamera lineup also adds a GTS trim for the 2025 model year. The Gran Turismo Sport costs a more attainable $156,195, with both prices including destination and handling feels. While the Turbo S E-Hybrid is the most powerful of the lot, the GTS is claimed to be the most agile.
2025 Porsche Panamera GTS
The Panamera GTS packs 493 hp or 20 hp more than the previous generation. It needs 3.6 seconds to hit 60 mph from a standstill, so it's a tenth of a second quicker. At full tilt, it does 188 mph. Compared to a more plebian version, the GTS sits 0.4 inches lower after tweaking the standard air suspension. In addition, the engineers from Zuffenhausen have beefed up the anti-roll bars and worked on the limited-slip differential for a more engaging drive.
Both new flavors of the Panamera will reach US dealers near the end of Q1 2025.

Ferrari's First EV Debuts In 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/726965/ferrari-ev-2025-debut-confirmed/,Ferrari’s CEO promises it’ll make the EV “in the right way.” It goes on sale in 2026.,12/25/2024 8:51,"Ferrari will reveal its first electric vehicle before the end of 2025. We know little about it, and that will probably remain the case until it debuts—unless Ferrari wants us to know something. In the meantime, the automaker is making big, somewhat vague, promises to its customers about what they should expect from the new EV.
Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told Autocar that its EV prototypes, with comically fake exhaust tips, have already completed over ""several thousand kilometers"" of testing, assuring that, ""When we do electric cars, we will produce them in the right way."" He called the car’s test drivers its ""first clients"" who have driven a lot of vehicles and can easily compare the EV to others. According to Vigna, people don’t buy a Ferrari for one particular thing—they buy it to have fun.
Ferrari EV test mule spy photo
Part of that experience will be the sound, a core Ferrari attribute that will radically change with its first electric vehicle. Vigna said earlier this year that Ferrari’s EVs will have unique “sound signatures,” but he didn’t elaborate. The company patented an exhaust note in 2023. Vigna said he was open about the possibilities EVs could allow with sound and feel—look at the programmable Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.
And Ferrari customers who still want combustion shouldn’t worry. Vigna said customer demand will determine what powertrains it produces—combustion, hybrid, or electric. He said forecasting sales based on powertrains was “an act of arrogance” and lacked “respect to the client,” adding that the company will never discuss sales splits.
The EV’s output and price will likely remain closely guarded secrets leading up to its reveal. Vigna wouldn’t confirm recent reports that the EV would cost $500,000, calling it “a surprise.” The company doesn’t set the MSRP until a month before the car launches, but no one expects it to be cheap. Ferrari’s electric car officially goes on sale in 2026.

Pagani Is Still Working On An Electric Hypercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/726824/pagani-electric-hypercar-development/,Just don't expect it anytime soon.,12/25/2024 8:51,"It’s still unclear when we'll see an electric Pagani hypercar. The supercar maker has been exploring the idea of an EV for over five years, but it still has numerous concerns about the technology. Pagani says it could water down what makes its cars so special. But the company hasn't given up on the idea, either.
Christopher Pagani, the founder’s son and Pagani’s marketing director, told CarBuzz that it hasn't abandoned the idea of an EV yet. ""We loved working on the electric car, and we still are working on this project, so it's not a closed chapter for us,"" he told the outlet.
But Pagani also noted that an electric hypercar is about more than just straight-line speed. ""For us, the performance is [in] the vehicle dynamics. It's not the amount of horsepower. It's not the top speed.""
Pagani Huayra Epitome
The company hasn’t produced a full-scale working prototype yet, and in 2023, Christopher said that the current battery technology is too heavy for the EV that Pagani wants to build. The company hopes to innovate in the space when it does deliver such a vehicle.
A Pagani EV probably won't happen anytime soon, even if the company believes it’s a worthwhile endeavor. Despite that, Pagani dealers aren’t interested, and they’ll be the ones selling it.
Pagani isn’t alone in seeing a growing disinterest in electric hypercars. Mate Rimac said earlier this year that high-end customers are already shying away from such cars, desiring combustion engines and an analog driving experience. As electric vehicle prices fall and go mainstream, wealthy clientele will want to differentiate themselves from the masses, which should help to give Pagani and its competitors plenty of business for years to come.

Here's Why The Lotus Evija X Crashed At Goodwood,https://www.motor1.com/news/726807/lotus-evija-x-hypercar-goodwood-crash-explained/,"Too much torque and not enough traction, essentially.",12/25/2024 8:51,"Last week at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a rare Lotus Evija X race car crashed off the starting line of the hill climb. The nearly 2,000-horsepower electric hypercar barely made it a few feet before ending up nose-first in a barrel of hay. But now we know exactly what happened.
According to Lotus—which offered more detail to the Goodwood Road & Racing website—the driver turned off traction control, which sent all 1,257 pound-feet of torque to the wheels in an instant. In the first few feet, the rear wheels were spinning at 170 miles per hour and the front tires were moving at 150 mph. The driver attempted to save the car from spinning by lifting off the throttle, but the balance of the car shifted, which sent it headlong into the hay barrels.
Instant torque combined with all that tire speed and no traction or rev limiter was a recipe for disaster. The entire incident lasted about 1.5 seconds from start to finish. Thankfully, the driver (who remains unnamed) walked away unharmed.
""Following a formal evaluation by both Goodwood and Lotus, asymmetric grip caused by overcorrection during rapid acceleration at the start line was determined to be the cause,"" Lotus told us in a statement earlier this week. ""The driver was unharmed in the incident and there was minimal damage to the car.""
It should be noted that the Lotus did complete a successful run of the hill climb earlier in the week. And traction control was turned off for that initial run. Unfortunately, the Evija X was never able to complete a timed run of the Goodwood hill climb following this incident.
Had it completed a timed run, the Evija X could have been one of the fastest cars of the weekend. It recently set a record at the Nordschleife for being the fastest car with a production chassis. With a lap time of 6 minutes and 24 seconds, the Evija X was third only to the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo and the Volkswagen ID.R.
Too bad we weren’t able to see that speed on display in Goodwood.

Damn: MG's New Electric Sports Car Concept Looks Good,https://www.motor1.com/news/726298/mg-cyber-gts-concept/,The hardtop electric coupe shows its face at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.,12/25/2024 8:51,"The MG Cyberster is a neat electric sports car that evokes the classic MG roadster. A hardtop version was just revealed at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed, though for now, it's only a concept. Say hello to the MG Cyber GTS.
Details are slim, but MG does more than simply add a fixed roof to the Cyberster. There's a 2+2 layout inside, but the car doesn't appear any longer or wider than its open-roof, two-seat sibling. The fastback blends wonderfully to the rear where we find a small ducktail spoiler atop familiar Cyberster taillights. The rear fascia incorporates a more aggressive diffuser, with prominent winglets on the corners of the front end. It suggests MG sees the hardtop as more of a track-focused fun machine.
That take is supported by MG's inspiration for the Cyber GTS Concept. In the late 1960s, MG built six MGC GTS Sebring race cars. Modern MG, which is now part of SAIC Motor in China, says the concept pays homage to these cars. It's also a nod to MG's 100th anniversary.
As for power, MG specifically mentions the Concept being rear-wheel drive. No other details are mentioned, but it's safe to assume a production version would utilize the Cyberster's single-motor layout. In the roadster, it generates 335 horsepower and uses a 74 kWh battery, enough to be lively despite its 4,000-pound curb weight. The dual-motor all-wheel-drive Cyberster is a couple hundred pounds heavier, but horsepower jumps to 503.
For a concept, the Cyber GTS looks like something that could enter production tomorrow. It's nothing like the EX181 Concept, which MG also debuted at Goodwood. Modeled after the original EX181 land speed record car from the 1950s, MG calls it a ""unique piece of automotive art"" that envisions what a modern version could look like.
Both cars are on display at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed, taking place July 11-14.

Porsche Is Taking a Huge Risk,https://www.motor1.com/features/725925/porsche-kill-cayman-boxster-macan-risk-opinion/,"The gas Boxster, Cayman, and Macan account for a third of Porsche sales. Soon they'll be gone.",12/25/2024 8:52,"Porsche won't invest in a new generation of the Boxster and Cayman with combustion engines, nor will we see a new generation of the gas-powered Macan. That means the good folks in Zuffenhausen are ready to let three of its most popular gas cars ride into the proverbial sunset.
The 718 models were already retired in Europe due to the General Safety Regulation (GSR2) that came into effect last week. In a statement to Motor1 earlier this year, Porsche 718 spokesperson Oliver Hilger said keeping the Boxster and Cayman in Europe just was ""not possible.""
Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS
""Implementation of the directive not only requires adjustments to the technical implementation, for example in the control units, but essentially also a change to processes in the development phase,"" Higler notes. ""For example, management systems will have to be developed and certified with regard to cybersecurity. The management and documentation of cybersecurity risks are tracked, structured, and formalized over the life cycle of the vehicle. All this could not be taken into account in the development of the 718 combustion models, as none of the requirements were known or applicable at the time. It is not possible to do this 'in reverse' without further ado.""
The mid-engine models will live on outside of the EU, but not for long. This week, Porsche's production manager Albrecht Reimold said the last Boxster and Cayman with gas engines will be assembled in mid-2025. The Macan (also gone in Europe due to GSR2 legislation) will stick around a bit longer in other regions. Reimold said the crossover will remain in production until 2026.
But sales show that Porsche's decision to phase out three popular gas cars is a risky bet.
Porsche Boxster
In 2023, Porsche delivered 87,355 Macan SUVs to customers, while the Boxster and Cayman were shipped to 20,518 clients. Considering the German automaker sold a total of 320,221 cars last year, the 718 and Macan accounted for a little over a third, at 107,873 units.
The numbers for the first half of 2024 are nearly the same. Porsche sold 39,167 Macans while the 982-generation sports cars achieved 11,886 deliveries. With a total of 155,945 cars shipped to buyers through June, the popular crossover, coupe, and convertible models once again represented roughly a third of volume, at 51,053 units.
The electric Boxster and Cayman will come out in 2025. But it begs the question: Will enthusiasts warm up to the idea of not having a combustion engine? Going EV means the manual gearbox will also become a thing of the past. Regardless of how good the electric replacements are, Porsche will probably lose customers who would only otherwise buy a performance vehicle with ICE power.
Pricing could also be a problem; History has taught us that EVs are almost always more expensive than the equivalent combustion car. Killing the conventionally powered 718 will mean that buying a two-door Porsche with a gas engine is going to get significantly pricier. Right now, a base Cayman is $74,795 after destination and handling fees. The cheapest 911 starts at $122,095. It's a $47,300 difference that will likely alienate many buyers.
Porsche Macan GTS
Although the gas Macan is still around (for now), its electric successor is already here. Deliveries to customers are scheduled to start later this year. It makes more sense for the crossover to embrace the EV trend than the 718s, but that comes with a price hike as well. You can have Porsche's smallest crossover with a combustion engine for $64,895, whereas the entry-level electric model is $80,450. That's nearly a $16,000 gap between the two.
Since EVs are still significantly more expensive to produce, it remains to be seen whether Porsche will be able to match the profit margins of the outgoing ICE cars. It's too late now for the company to change its mind. With emissions regulations getting stricter, we wouldn't hold our breath for a new gas-only sports car. Even the Mazda Miata lost its 2.0-liter engine in Europe.
Could Porsche have done things differently? Well, company officials made it clear that updating the current 718s to meet regulations would have been a costly endeavor. In the case of the Macan, there are also issues regarding the availability of certain parts, according to Reimold.
While most purists probably won't care about the lack of a gas engine in the Macan, ideally, we would have gotten another generation of the ICE Boxster and Cayman. But that ship sailed long ago; The EV replacement was announced in 2022.
Porsche is sticking with its objective to have EVs account for more than 80 percent of annual shipments by 2030. To get there, the next-generation Cayenne is also going to be an EV. In addition, another large SUV coming in the next few years will be electric-only. That SUV will be positioned above the Cayenne and will likely offer three-row seating.
Porsche Panamera
What about the Panamera? Taycan model line boss Kevin Giek recently told Autocar that an electric Panamera can peacefully coexist with the Taycan. He went on to say that a Panamera EV would cater to customers looking for a larger and more luxurious model while the Taycan targets those in the market for a sportier EV.
As for the legendary 911, it's not going to lose its rear-mounted engine this decade. There is a hybrid with the 2025 Carrera GTS, but a full EV won't happen before 2030. Porsche hopes synthetic fuels will give ICE a new lease on life. It's been producing eFuel from water and carbon dioxide using wind energy at a plant in Chile since late 2022.
At the beginning of the month, Reuters reported that the European People's Party, the largest lawmaker group in the European Parliament, wants to weaken the sales ban on new cars that emit CO2. The news agency obtained a draft document indicating the intention to loosen the rules pertaining to CO2 reductions.
2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS Coupe
According to Euronews, the European Commission has already promised to develop a legal route that would allow cars to run on synthetic fuel as long as the production process is carbon neutral. The last-minute change to the proposed legislation was done following pressure from Germany.
Regardless of how things go with the legislation, Porsche is pressing ahead with its EV agenda. Time will tell whether replacing several gas cars with electric models before the end of the decade, let alone by 2035, is the right move.

2025 Porsche 911 Review: A Hybrid Without Compromise,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/726006/2025-porsche-911-hybrid-first-drive-review/,Porsche engineers are very proud of its hybrid 911. They have every right to be.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Porsche's engineers insist the new 911 doesn’t feel like a hybrid. But how could it not? The new 911 Carrera GTS has an electric motor splined to the crankshaft of its flat-six, plus a massive electric turbocharger. It took me a little bit of time behind the wheel to figure out what they meant—Porsche’s new hybrid 911 does feel like a hybrid, just not like any hybrid before it.
Long rumored, Porsche debuted its new hybrid powertrain with the facelifted 2025 911 Carrera GTS. It uses a 1.9-kilowatt-hour, 400-volt lithium-ion battery pack under the front hood to power a 53.6-horsepower motor paired to a new 3.6-liter flat-six with an electric turbocharger. The turbo has a 14.7-hp motor situated on the shaft connecting the turbine and compressor wheels, which can accelerate or slow down the whole thing as needed. This means the turbo can limit boost pressure and put electrical energy back into the system. There’s no wastegate.
It’s not a plug-in system like basically every other performance car from Europe at the moment, and there’s no clutch between the engine and the electric traction motor, so there’s no all-electric driving either. In total, you get 532 hp and 449 pound-feet of torque, which runs through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission to either the rear, or all four wheels.
The goal here was twofold. Design a system that was as light as possible—the target curb weight for the new GTS was just over 3,500 pounds, and US-spec cars weigh 103 pounds more than their predecessors—and one that allowed the engine to run at the ideal air-fuel ratio of 14.7:1 at all speeds to comply with stricter European regulations. And, of course, it had to offer a meaningful performance boost.
We headed to southern Spain to sample the new 992 in the Andalusian mountains and on the Ascari race circuit. At first, there are only subtle hints that the GTS is a hybrid. The engine fires in an instant, the traction motor taking over the duty of a traditional starter and its typical chuga-chuga-chuga-whump; and from low revs in a high gear, there is occasionally a sensation of instant torque that you don’t get in a non-hybrid 911. I spent the first few minutes trying to find the point where the car does something that makes you go, “Ah! That’s not normal!” Except for fleeting moments, it’s not there.
In reality, it’s exceedingly difficult to suss out what the system is doing because it’s almost constantly shuffling electric power between the traction motor, the turbo, and the battery. There’s a display on the infotainment screen illustrating power flow, though it’s almost impossible to follow with how quickly power moves around.
It’s endlessly fascinating, but it also feels normal. If you shut off the part of your brain trying to figure out what the hybrid system is doing, you just experience excellent throttle response, and, well, the sheer speed of it all. We started the day in a Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet, and it hauls ass. There’s no big wallop of electric torque like you get in other performance hybrids, but smooth, prodigious, instant power delivery instead.
I can’t say it feels naturally aspirated, because the Carrera GTS is far too torquey. But it doesn’t feel turbocharged either because engine response is so good. It’s somewhere in between, and totally its own thing. The traction motor also does a lot at high engine speeds, coming in strong around 5,000 rpm to make the GTS’s flat-six wake up like a great naturally aspirated engine, compensating for the turbocharger as it starts to run out of puff.
What really gives the game away is the sound of the turbocharger. In Sport Plus mode, the car spools up the turbo more aggressively off throttle and under braking, and it makes all kinds of funky noises. Hit the brakes hard downshifting into a corner, and you can hear a whistle rising in pitch as the motor speeds up the turbo toward its 120,000-rpm maximum. Otherwise, it huffs and chuffs away as you get on and off throttle.
Chassis-wise, it feels very similar to the last Carrera GTS, which was the goal. Porsche widened the rear tires by 10 millimeters to 315 millimeters, the same size as the Turbo, and consequently changed some of the suspension components. The new engine is a bit narrower, which allowed Porsche to fit larger tires under narrower bodywork, and the extra power and torque demanded them. Porsche’s optional Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active anti-roll bars now run off the 400-volt system, too, so they work more quickly and precisely.
Essentially, the 911 GTS stops and turns as brilliantly as ever. Even this all-wheel drive Cabriolet feels keen to dig into corners, and traction is typically 911 immense. There’s not a ton of suspension travel, yet the damping is superb. It’s a car you get keyed into straight away, inspiring the confidence to hustle it on a mountain road. Unlike a lot of hybrid cars, the 911 Carrera GTS uses a conventional braking system, where the pedal only directly connects to the brakes. But under braking, the traction motor does do some amount of regeneration, which you can’t really feel.
Driving on track has a wonderful way of focusing the mind. There’s not really time to think about how the hybrid system is working when concentrating on hitting your marks, especially on an unfamiliar circuit. Ascari is interesting, too, a long, narrow, technical track with basically one of every type of corner, and here, we benefit from following an instructor in a 911 Turbo S.
In a situation like this, you want a predictable car. Its outputs must match your inputs. Despite its complexity, the Carrera GTS is never underfoot. It does exactly what you want when you want it.
I spent the first few minutes trying to find the point where the car does something that makes you go, ""Ah! That’s not normal!"" Except for fleeting moments, it's not there.
The hybrid system never crosses your mind here, which is a remarkable achievement. When you push the throttle pedal, it’s not simply sending a signal to the throttle body to open a certain amount. In an instant, the car has to make all kinds of decisions on how to use the engine and the hybrid components, and every time you go back to the throttle pedal—or come off it for that matter—the calculus changes. Yet, as a driver, you have no sense of this. You just get the torque when you want it.
Sure, the extra grunt of the system lets you use third gear to pull out of a chicane where you might have needed second otherwise, but there’s no penalty for revving it either. Just drive it as you would any other 911.
And as ever, the 992-generation 911 is a wonderful track car. Sweet handling balance, a talkative chassis, and mighty brakes inspire huge confidence, and the car feels like it’s ready to run all day. We sampled both rear-drive Carrera GTS and all-wheel drive Carrera 4 GTS, and frankly, it’s hard at times to tell the difference between the two.
Maybe the rear-drive version has slightly sweeter steering. But on turn-in and in mid-corner, the cars behave almost exactly the same. The all-wheel-drive system feels so subtle, the car obediently tucking the nose with a lift of the throttle, yet providing even better traction to pull the car straight at corner exit. Jorg Bergmeister, the Porsche factory driver who helped develop the new car, says the big differences between the two are only really evident when you’re far over the limit of grip.
All of the cars on hand for lapping had optional $9,780 carbon-ceramic brakes, which Porsche enlarged for the extra power. The front brakes and 10-piston(!) calipers are off the 911 Turbo, while the rears are unique to this car. In the great Porsche tradition, they are unflappable, stopping the car over and over again without a hint of fade and with seamless ABS engagement. Pedal feel is also superb, helping the driver meter out exactly how much pressure you need on initial application and as you bleed pressure off on turn-in.
On track, we also got a chance to sample the base, non-hybrid 992 Carrera for a few laps. It definitely feels lighter than the GTS, and yes, you obviously notice the relative lack of power. But, with 388 hp from a revised 3.0-liter twin-turbo flat-six, the Carrera is still plenty quick, and for a lot less money than the GTS, you get the vast majority of the 911 goodness. It’s a sweetheart.
The rest of the changes for this facelifted 992 are pretty minor. A digital gauge cluster brings more functionality, but it’s far less elegant than the analog tach of the previous model. The looks are subtly different, but integrating all the light functions into one unit helps clean up the front end. And there’s a push-button for starting the engine, which doesn’t have the same sense of occasion as a key. Things Porsche people may probably care about too much, but ultimately don’t matter.
A tougher pill to swallow is the price. Porsche is quick to point out the additional standard equipment and performance, but the Carrera GTS coupe starts at $166,895. Even the base Carrera, which isn’t all that different from last year’s model, rises in price by almost $8,000 to $122,095. And all of the GTS models we drove were specced beyond the $200,000 mark.
Really, this facelift is all about the hybrid. Porsche is rightfully proud of it. Its engineers are rightfully protective of the 911, and they feel like this is the best solution for the sports car. Porsche’s hybrid system is far lighter than any of its competitors’ systems, and it effectively meets the needs of increasing performance and response while dealing with more stringent regulations.
I still contend it feels like a hybrid because it feels different from the previous Carrera GTS. Yet, I get what the engineers are saying. This feels like the first truly no-compromise performance hybrid out there.
More importantly, it feels like a 911.

Dead: The Gas Porsche Boxster and Cayman,https://www.motor1.com/news/725828/porsche-boxster-cayman-ice-die-2025/,"The duo won't be around by the end of 2025, and the Macan with combustion engines will be retired in 2026.",12/25/2024 8:52,"Earlier this year, Porsche was forced to retire the 718 Boxster and Cayman in Europe due to new cybersecurity regulations. The Macan with gasoline engines suffered the same fate. However, the sports car duo and the crossover are still available to purchase outside of the EU. Even so, the writing is on the wall for these models equipped with combustion engines.
Porsche's production manager Albrecht Reimold told Automobilwoche the Boxster and Cayman will go out of production by the middle of next year. Porsche is pressing ahead with the all-electric replacement, which he has already driven, and promises it'll be a ""real fun car."" No further details were released, but judging by spy shots, the convertible is likely to come out first.
Another Porsche with gas engines facing the chopping block is the previous-generation Macan. While the all-new EV successor is already out, the old sporty crossover is still sold outside of Europe. Reimold says that by the middle of 2026, the company will be ""fully committed"" to the electric successor. Limited availability of parts is accelerating the ICE model's demise.
Increasingly stricter regulations in Europe are also another nail in the Macan's coffin. Reimold mentioned it wouldn't be financially feasible to invest in a 10-year-old car, even though it's one of the best-selling products: ""Volume alone is not a benchmark for us as a luxury manufacturer.""
Judging by 2023 sales, the impending demise of these three cars is likely to have a huge impact on deliveries. The 718 lineup grew last year by 13 percent to 20,518 units while demand for the Macan remained at the previous year's level, with 87,355 vehicles. The smaller of the two Porsche SUVs was almost the top seller, trailing behind the Cayenne by fewer than 200 units.
The electric Macan has more chances of luring in buyers who would've opted for a gasoline engine. It remains to be seen how enthusiasts will feel about not having an engine behind the seats of a Boxster/Cayman. We won't be too surprised if the outgoing 718 will benefit from a sales surge while the gas engines are still offered. That said, the models are gone from Europe, so Porsche can only dream of reaching the sales performance of 2023.

You Can Buy A New Toyota Mirai For Half The Price,https://www.motor1.com/news/725500/toyota-mirai-50-percent-discount/,Not convinced yet? You can even get it with zero percent financing for 72 months.,12/25/2024 8:52,"When the automaker admits one of its products has ""not been successful,"" you know there are deals to be had. Toyota is trying to lure people into buying the slow-selling Mirai by shaving off a whopping 49 percent from the hydrogen sedan's original price tag. The Limited trim is now $33,000 cheaper than the MSRP of $67,115. Cars Direct got a hold of a bulletin sent to dealers, and this discount is confirmed on Toyota's website.
To sweeten the pot, the massive price reduction can be combined with zero percent financing for 72 months. Stick to the base XLE trim and Toyota shaves off a substantial $25,000 from the original $50,190 sticker. This cash incentive can also be combined with zero percent APR on the entry-level Mirai.
To sweeten the pot, Toyota also throws in $15,000 worth of hydrogen fuel for six years. That means a Mirai Limited buyer can save as much as $48,000. A Mirai XLE with the fat cash incentive combined with the complimentary fuel brings savings of $37,000.
Exactly how bad are sales? There's no point in beating around the bush–they're awful. Through June, Toyota only sold 245 cars in the United States, representing a decline of 85.8 percent compared to the first six months of 2022. Last month, only 20 vehicles changed hands. Despite sluggish sales, the company pledged its long-term commitment to hydrogen tech in an e-mail sent to Motor1 several months ago.
Toyota is not the only Japanese brand offering a hydrogen car in the United States. Honda recently launched the CR-V e:FCEV as a plug-in hybrid since the crossover also features a rechargeable battery pack. Alternatively, South Korea's Hyundai Nexo Fuel Cell is still available. Of the three, only the CR-V e:FCEV is built in the US.
Elsewhere, BMW will decide later this year whether it'll build a hydrogen car. If that happens, it'll go on sale before the end of the decade, paving the way for more models planned to arrive in the 2030s.

Hop Inside This Mercedes-AMG One As It Hits 215 MPH On The Autobahn,https://www.motor1.com/news/724812/mercedes-amg-one-215-mph-autobahn-video/,"Turns out 1,049 horsepower is more than enough for big triple-digit speeds on the world's fastest highway.",12/25/2024 8:52,"The AMG One hypercar was made to carve corners. Mercedes says it's a Formula 1 car for the road, after all. But having 1,049 horsepower means straight-line speed is also immense. Here's proof.
The Gercollector YouTube channel filmed a recent outing with their own Mercedes-AMG One as they took it to Germany's Autobahn highway, where there is no speed limit. There, the car was able to reach a maximum speed of 347 km/h (215 mph) before having to slow for traffic. That is incredibly fast.
All those horses come courtesy of a 1.6-liter turbocharged V-6 lifted from AMG's Formula 1 program, paired to three electric motors (two at the front, and another at the rear attached to the engine). The engine can rev up to 11,000 rpm, and because there's next to no sound-deadening inside, you can hear every last ignition.
AMG says the top speed for the One is 219 mph, but considering just how hard the car was pulling when the driver had to lift off, we suspect the true top speed is even quicker. With a curb weight of around 3,700 pounds and moving active aero that can tuck away to eliminate drag, we could see the AMG One breeze by 225 mph with enough space, judging by this footage.
Just as cool are the noises the AMG One makes. In addition to the wailing V-6, the car delivers a satisfying e-motor whine to the cabin as it cruises leisurely through the German countryside while in its all-electric mode. There's also the gearshift clunk as the car moves its way up the bespoke sequential transmission.

Barring all of that: If you’re in the market for a new Maserati GranCabrio, do yourself a favor and get the all-electric Folgore. It simply lives up to the grand-touring ideal better and more elegantly than its gasoline-powered twin.
The 2025 Maserati GranCabrio comes in two varieties: The Trofeo, powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine making 542 horsepower, and the Folgore, with three electric motors making a standard 760 horsepower—with a short burst of up to 1,200 horsepower. Both models are all-wheel drive. At a sumptuous drive program on the shores of Lake Maggiore, where Northern Italy brushes up against Switzerland, Maserati introduced us to both versions of the all-new four-seat convertible.
The gasoline-burning Trofeo gets its power from a lightly finessed version of the Nettuno engine that first debuted in the MC20 supercar. This engine, with its unusual 90-degree layout, is compact enough to sit entirely behind the GranCabrio’s front differential, which allowed Maserati to snuggle the engine down lower than you’d typically see in an all-wheel-drive car. (It also let Maserati head of design Klaus Busse draw the clamshell hood nice and low, the way it should be on a sports car).
Utilizing precombustion-chamber technology adapted from Formula 1, the GranCabrio Trofeo makes 479 pound-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm and pulls authoritatively right up to its 6,500-rpm redline.
The combustion-powered Trofeo can sprint from a stop to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds, on the way to a 196-mph top speed. On the hairpin-heavy, sometimes alarmingly narrow mountain roads of the Italian Alps, the gasser never ran out of breath. There’s no soft spot in the Trofeo’s powerband. There’s just a steady rush as mid-range torque hands you off to top-end horsepower.
The Nettuno engine sings baritone, a scale that starts at a loping, bassy burble and ends in a classic sports-car rasp, accentuated by a multi-mode exhaust (and a little airbrushing via stereo-system enhancement) that gets progressively louder as you dial the drive-mode knob from GT to Sport to Corsa. With the cockpit closed, you’ll never hear a whisper of turbo noise, but roof-down days add an undercurrent of whooshing air to the music.
Here’s the thing: With its relatively low 6,500-rpm redline, the GranCabrio Trofeo upshifts right as the soundtrack gets exciting. The gearbox is the ubiquitous torque-converter eight-speed manufactured by ZF and installed in seemingly everything but washing machines and cement mixers. Left on its own, it upshifts obsessively, pushing the tach needle down below 2,000 rpm where the engine’s roar becomes an unenthusiastic groan. There are paddle shifters, of course, roughly the size and shape of a scrawny banana. Shifting for yourself, you can keep the engine in its ideal vocal range, but you’ll never be able to ignore the slight lag between shift request and gear change.
You look at a car like the GranCabrio, with its pouncing silhouette and athletic curves, and you imagine yourself driving every mile heroically, upshifting at redline and cracking off burbling downshifts into Alpine apexes, the song of racing legacy echoing behind you. It’s a fantasy. Most of us spend the brunt of our driving days farting along from place to place, hemmed in by traffic, bad roads, and the law. That’s why if you’re eyeing the GranCabrio, I suggest you opt for the all-electric Folgore.
Viewed by the rigid metric of straight-line performance, the Folgore is the obvious choice. Thanks to 995 lb-ft of instant torque, the BEV convertible does zero-to-60 in 2.8 seconds, according to Maserati, and sprints the quarter-mile in 10.6 on its way to a 180-mph top speed.
Unlike nearly every other EV on the market, the GranCabrio Folgore doesn’t have a floor full of batteries—the 92.5-kilowatt-hour pack is T-shaped, fitting inside the transmission tunnel and behind the passenger compartment, repurposing space demanded by the combustion drivetrain. This let Maserati keep the electric GranCabrio deliciously low-slung and helped the Folgore achieve a perfect 50/50 front/rear weight distribution.
Like most BEVs, the GranCabrio Folgore weighs a ton—nearly two tons, actually. It’s 5,249 pounds in US spec, compared to 4,316 pounds for the gasoline-powered Trofeo. It’s also mostly silent, emitting a distant, low thrum that rises with speed. What were once shift paddles now control regenerative braking, adjustable between three levels but never quite strong enough for true one-pedal driving.
Here’s the part that feels slightly like magic: On a winding mountain road, the all-electric Folgore handles almost identically to the dinosaur-burning Trofeo. Both take a curve with no perceptible body roll, the steering is light, and the brakes linear and accurate. Each car uses electronic dampers that firm up in Sport mode and go one notch further in Corsa, which sends the height-adjustable air springs down to their lowest ride height.
Our Italian test route was defined by annoyingly high-quality pavement, the stuff American drivers only see during daydreams or European vacations. When I could find the occasional pothole or frost heave, the GranCabrio had great compliance even in its firmest setting. Occasionally, Corsa mode delivered a ripple of flinty high-frequency motion, eliminated by hitting the damper button, which adjusts between firmer and damper sub-settings within each drive mode.
The GranCabrio, of course, is the drop-top sibling to the GranTurismo coupe. Grand touring, as a concept, is not about ultimate, hair-on-fire speed. It’s about effortlessness, elegance, and the ability to dispatch hundreds of miles at a time with grace and pace. Functionally, just about any brand-new car on sale today can take you long distances in relative comfort, so our definition of grand touring needs a 21st-century update. Speed? Absolutely. Power? Undoubtedly. But to truly tour grandly, you need stylish nonchalance. The Italians have a word for this—sprezzatura. Get there fast, and make it look like nothing. The all-electric Folgore is dripping in sprezzatura. Always powerful, never shouting about it.
Sure: If Maserati offered a clutch pedal and a gated shifter in the GranCabrio, I’d tell you to get it. But that would be a different kind of machine, one defined by the work it demanded of its driver. With the GranCabrio Folgore, you can rocket your way up the Alps and never have to raise your voice. Plus, where else can you get a drop-top EV? Even if a miracle happens and the Tesla Roadster arrives, it’ll never be mistaken for stylish.
The GranCabrio is not perfect. The back seats are more inviting than what you’d find in a Continental GT or 911, with just enough headroom for this six-footer to squeeze back there with the roof closed, but they’re still occasional-use-only. The trunk is decently sized for two people on a long weekend, slightly less so when you fold down the roof, which kicks out an expansion panel that eats up a little cargo space. Speaking of which: You open and close the convertible roof by swiping and holding your finger on the center-stack touchscreen, an unnecessarily fussy way to handle the task if, say, you’re trying to get out of a downpour.
The all-electric GranCabrio is not for everybody. Maserati predicts a relatively mediocre battery range of 233 miles and says you can get as much as 48 miles of charge in 5 minutes if you manage to find an 800-volt station. The navigation system automatically locates Maserati charging stations and shows your predicted driving range as a continuously updated radius, but we were not given the chance to test the charging experience on our one-day, two-vehicle drive.
And then, well… the electric GranCabrio costs $205,000, a whole 13 grand richer than the gasoline-powered Trofeo. Both models arrive in US dealerships this summer.
Right now, there’s really not anything out there that compares to the GranCabrio Folgore. Four-seat, drop-top performance EVs are a category of one. And that’s probably the ultimate expression of sprezzatura: Doing it in a way nobody else can.

Nissan Techs Are Making House Calls to Teach Owners How to Use Their Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/724924/nissan-second-delivery-program/,Does this mean there's too much tech in vehicles?,12/25/2024 8:52,"In case you haven't noticed, modern vehicles are packed with features and technology. Even the Nissan Versa—the cheapest new car in the United States—has a 7-inch touchscreen with voice controls and buttons all over the steering wheel. Step up to something like the Ariya and there's even more to suss out. The basics are usually straightforward, but figuring out all the tech can be intimidating. Nissan wants to change that.
The automaker is launching a new program called Second Delivery. It's essentially a no-cost follow-up visit for people who buy a new Nissan, designed to help them learn just what their car can do. A Nissan ""tech expect"" will coordinate a time and place to meet the owner, generally two weeks after the first delivery. That can be at the owner's home, work, a lunch stop at the local Starbucks, or the dealership where it all began. The expert will take the owner through all the vehicle's systems, step-by-step.
Such things are generally done during the normal delivery process, but the idea here is to give owners some time to acclimate to their new car before diving deeper. Details can also be missed during the big day, as owners are often excited to get on the road with their spanking-new ride. Listening to a salesperson prattle on about automatic headlight functions or adjusting climate settings through your phone may not stick the first time around.
""Now more than ever, customers expect a personalized experience that matches their wants and needs,"" said Dan Mohnke, Nissan VP of eCommerce and customer experience. ""These types of experiences are extremely important for us to offer for our Ariya customers, who are largely new to the Nissan brand and interested in using all of the latest technology.""
For now, Second Delivery is only offered on the Ariya, presumably because it's Nissan's most technologically demanding vehicle. The service ""is expected to expand"" later in 2024 to the Rogue and Leaf.

Volvo Email to Customers: EX90 Will Be Missing Features at Launch,https://www.motor1.com/news/724813/volvo-ex90-missing-features-delivery/,"Wireless Apple CarPlay, bidirectional charging, and a light theme for the displays could be missing when owners take delivery.",12/25/2024 8:52,"Volvo finally started production of the EX90 earlier this month after promising to deliver it to customers in early 2024. The automaker had to delay the EV's launch to fix some remaining software issues, and while deliveries still won't start until the second half of the year, the EX90 might not arrive in customers' driveways fully baked.
A reader passed along an email he'd received from the automaker with a link to a list of features ""that may be delayed when taking delivery of your EX90."" The list includes safety and convenience features, with the full capability and integration of the LiDAR system unlocked after a future update. Other features that might be missing include cross-traffic alert, curve speed assist, wireless Apple CarPlay, and bidirectional charging.
Owners will have to settle for the dark theme for the infotainment display and driver display for the foreseeable future, as the light theme will arrive in a future update.
They'll also have to be okay with the possibility the EV could lose about 3 percent of its battery per day when parked and not being charged. Volvo says the EX90's core computer has to run in the background right now to control its ""highly advanced functions,” but that'll be fixed by a future update. The energy use stops after 72 hours as the car enters ""a deep sleep mode to conserve battery power.""
Motor1 reached out to Volvo to ask when customers could expect to receive these paid-for features and much-needed updates. We'll be sure to update this article when we hear back.
In its email to customers, the company said that most of the missing features will arrive for free via over-the-air updates. However, some might have to bring their vehicle to a dealer, who Volvo will notify ahead of time.

Study: Nearly Half of EV Owners in America Want to Switch Back to Gas,https://www.motor1.com/news/724788/half-ev-owners-american-switch-gas/,Inadequate charging infrastructure is keeping people from buying EVs.,12/25/2024 8:52,"A few years ago, automakers started to roll out elaborate plans to convert their lineups to battery-electric vehicles. Some even set deadlines for ending gas-powered car production. But many are now reevaluating the future. Sales are slowing for some and not others, consumer interest is waning, and now nearly half of EV owners in America might switch back to gas. What is going on?
McKinsey & Co.'s 2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse study reveals that 46 percent of EV owners in the United States, well above the worldwide average of 29 percent, want to switch to gasoline cars because of the inadequate charging infrastructure. Thirty-five percent of global respondents said the public network isn't good enough yet. Thirty-four percent said EV ownership costs remain too high, while 32 percent said EVs impacted their driving patterns too much on long trips.
The US charging network is growing, which could eliminate these hurdles for owners. As of May, the US had 183,000 public EV chargers, but there still aren't enough. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 allocated $5 billion in grants toward building fast chargers, but the rollout is taking forever due to a myriad of local, state, and federal regulations and consumer needs.
Other reasons owners gave as to why they might switch back include the inability to charge at home (24 percent), the stress of worrying about charging (21 percent), and charging mobility requirements (16 percent). Only 13 percent said they did not enjoy the driving experience. Some people just enjoy driving a combustion car, like 18 percent of US respondents and 28 percent in Germany.
The study also reveals why automakers seem so disjointed from one another in their EV efforts. Growth and the desire to switch back aren't equal worldwide, and some markets are converting faster than others, putting automakers in a difficult position of attempting to cater to wildly varying needs across the globe.
Shockingly, Americans aren't the most eager to switch back to gas. In Australia, a country known for its vast interior, 49 percent of EV owners are considering returning to the pump. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Japan, where only 13 percent of owners might return to a combustion-powered vehicle. Other countries below the worldwide average include Italy (15 percent), France (18 percent), Germany (24 percent), and China (28 percent). Brazil joins the US and Australia above the average at 38 percent.

Mercedes Is Spending Big Money On Gas Engines Again,https://www.motor1.com/news/724830/mercedes-spending-big-money-gas-engines/,"""A lot more"" is being invested in the S-Class compared to a usual facelift.",12/25/2024 8:52,"After conceding that its electrification goals have been overly ambitious, Mercedes is now pouring an obscene amount of money into combustion engines. In an interview with German publication Wirtschaftswoche, CEO Ola Källenius said ICE technology ""will last well into the 2030s."" To make sure gas engines will meet increasingly stringent regulations, massive investments are necessary.
Just this year, the three-pointed star is spending €14 billion (about $15 billion at current exchange rates) on its passenger car division alone. The funds are reserved for ""high-tech combustion technology” but also electrification and digitalization. Although the Swedish-German business executive didn’t specify how much Mercedes is spending on ICE, he admitted it's ""more money than previously planned.""
Källenius brought up the S-Class and the flagship's mid-cycle update scheduled for 2026: ""We have invested a lot more in the model update of the new combustion engine S-Class than we normally spend on a facelift."" The goal for Mercedes is to have its conventional powertrains at ""the very highest technological level."" Without spending big money on gasoline and diesel engines, the luxury brand ""would suddenly stall our combustion engine business in 2027 or 2028.""
He was referring to Euro 7 and China 7 regulations and how the engines must be updated to run cleaner to meet stricter emissions rules. The goal is for Mercedes to tweak all ""relevant combustion engines and transmission combinations"" to avoid having to pay massive fines. Källenius mentioned future engines will be electrified to some extent, so expect even more hybrids in the lineup.
Mercedes knows it must adapt now that the transition to EVs isn’t going as planned. Three years ago, it said plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars would represent about 50 percent of annual sales by 2025. However, that’s highly unlikely to happen. At one point, the company even said it would go fully electric by 2030 in some countries “where market conditions allow.”
After being hit in the face by reality, Mercedes has no other way but to readjust its goals. It now wants hybrids and electric cars to account for half of deliveries by the end of the decade. The ultimate objective to become carbon neutral by 2040 hasn't changed, according to Källenius.
He refuted rumors about the company canceling the development of a platform for the next-generation EQS: ""The project is running at high speed."" In addition, it's not scrapping plans for the promised eight gigafactories to build batteries to support its electric ambitions. However, the facilities will be ready ""a little later"" than originally planned.
Since we mentioned the EQS, there was an interesting report earlier this year about how Mercedes was testing its stately electric car with a range-extending combustion engine. The big EV was allegedly fitted with a tiny two-cylinder, 1.0-liter turbocharged engine mounted at the front. However, trials were supposedly stopped.
Mercedes does have a deal with Geely to jointly work on hybrid engines that will go into Volvo models as well. The Chinese automotive giant has expertise in range-extenders, including a separate deal with Renault. The newly formed Horse division specializes in combustion engines, including those developed as range extenders.

The Future Is Bleak. The Kia EV9 Proves It Doesn't Have to Be,https://www.motor1.com/features/724674/kia-ev9-sustainable-future-feature/,"I loaded up a Kia EV9 with friends, drove to the coast, and there, I found hope.",12/25/2024 8:52,"The city of Seattle was an environmental disaster from the moment it was founded in 1851. Its primary industry in the middle of the 19th century was the overzealous logging of 40-story-tall, millennia-old trees. (Its secondary industry was prostitution.)
Seattle’s first sewage system dumped directly into the Puget Sound, and high tide frequently flooded low-lying city streets with raw human waste. In the 1940s, hydrocarbons (and smog) from coal fires reached a crescendo, and massive fish die-offs occurred in Grays Harbor as factories dumped toxic anaerobic runoff into the Pacific Ocean. By the late 1960s, the city of Tacoma semi-permanently reeked of rotten eggs, a byproduct of pulp-plant pollution.
On July 1st, 1970, Washington established the Department of Ecology, the nation’s first environmental agency.
Fifty-four years later, I’m driving 250 miles around the Sound to the Olympic Coast, and without burning a single hydrocarbon. I took five of my friends with me in a three-row electric SUV powered by renewable energy. I vacationed on pristine beaches and walked in preserved ancient rainforests to discover how we built this better world out of the disasters of yore, and what it can teach us for the future.
Seeking a better future has long felt impossible for me: I am a millennial. The headlines—ecological and otherwise—have been bleak for my whole life. Since college, I’ve assumed I would have front-row seats to the seemingly inevitable collapse that runaway global warming would precipitate, and the past few years’ violent weather has only reinforced those worries: I’ve personally had to flee life-threatening climates half a dozen times in my life—first from hostile weather, then from hostile politics. It has felt like the walls are closing in, and hope of a better future is rapidly dwindling.
I’m not an aberration. According to Pew Research, most Americans believe climate change is currently hurting Americans, and roughly two-thirds believe the climate will worsen in their lifetimes. A majority are anxious about the future of the planet, but only 38% are optimistic that the problem can actually be addressed. This fear echoes broadly through our society. Polling shows that large majorities of Americans believe the country will be more unequal, less unified, and weaker by 2050.
Americans can seemingly only agree on one thing: We’re headed for a precipice.
The women in my car have lived their adult lives immersed in these feelings, for another common trait unites us: We are all transgender. Half of us relocated to Seattle within the past three years to escape the red states we lived in, when the institutional bigotry became too much for us to handle. Before I moved to Seattle, I lived in rural Idaho. I had taken to reading the state legislatures’ bills every day for its entire session, just to ensure nothing suddenly changed in my legal status.
The dire future is not abstract for us. It has already shaped how we live today.
This influenced our choice of locale. Our destination was Kalaloch Lodge, a rustic series of cabins constructed from driftwood perched on the cliffs of the Pacific, at the edge of Olympic National Park. The lodge proudly proclaims on its website that there is no cell signal at Kalaloch, and no internet available in the cabins. The only visible nod to modernization since it was first built in 1953 is a handful of Level 2 EV chargers, provided free of charge for guests with electric cars.
Around the Lodge is nothing but National Park and Forest land, a protected seashore, and an ocean preserve. Notably absent: civilization. We could completely unplug from our phones—and the stress underpinning American life.
We’d earned it.
It fell to me to find a vehicle suitable for our journey. Options are virtually endless at every price point and demeanor imaginable… unless, of course, you want an electric SUV, where three-row options have stayed scarce, even as Americans grow increasingly accepting of battery-powered vehicles.
And I desperately wanted an electric SUV. A big part of Seattle’s beauty—and what made it the only American city represented in the UN’s Role Model Cities for ecological restoration—is that its power grid is almost entirely clean. 98% of Seattle’s electricity is fully renewable, largely supplied via a series of hydroelectric dams built during the New Deal era. Charging up an electric car in Seattle is as close to living in a post-carbon world as you can get in America, and the Kalaloch Lodge’s chargers promised to make the 200-ish mile journey doable.
There was one other motivation for an electric car. My non-car-enthusiast friends who accompanied me on this journey frequently experience automotive culture as a net negative in their lives. Often, the interests of drivers are pitted against those of the climate (or pedestrians, or transit, etc.), which makes the world of car enthusiasm seem indefensible to them. I wanted to show them that our vehicles could be part of building a better world, and a road trip in a carbon-free SUV felt like the best way to do that.
There are only a handful of options for a three-row electric SUV currently on the market.
There’s Tesla’s Model X, which has an almost unusably small third row, ostentatiously gimmicky doors, and a founder who explicitly hates me and all my friends. I ruled that one out pretty quickly. There’s the Rivian R1S, which has been well-reviewed as a would-be super-SUV competitor, with 1,000+ horsepower variants and sub-three-second dashes to 60.
The Kia EV9 intrigued me for the opposite reason. The EV9 is so normal. While it does carry over some of Kia’s retrofuturistic styling from the smaller EV6 in its front fascia and wild wheel designs, at a glance, it’s not all that different from a gas-powered Telluride.
It doesn’t boast four-digit horsepower or a rock-crawling package. It has three roomy rows and excellent cargo capacity, even when chock-full of passengers. It’s relatively affordable, with a base price of $54,900—dead-on average cost for a new EV. If it didn’t hum instead of rumble, you’d likely never notice it was even an EV. It seemed like the ideal companion for a road trip like this.
With an EV9 lined up and our journey set, we headed out towards the coast. The first leg consisted of a ferry ride across the Puget Sound. While it would have been technically possible to take our journey without riding a ferry, it was part of the fun and extremely easy—Washington State Ferries is the largest ferry operating service in America, and its regular service is incredibly scenic. The sparkling waters of the Sound set the tone for the rest of our trip into the unspoiled lands of the Olympic Peninsula.
Our route then took us down the northernmost end of U.S. 101, which encircles the Peninsula. I found the EV9 doing exactly what I desired from it, which was mile-eating comfort for everyone in the car. Some girls slept, some chatted; I kept the (Meridian!) sound system cooly playing 1960s blues and jazz as we snaked through some of America’s most stunning vistas.
The EV9 performed as I hoped it would—stoically composed. As the driver, I found it perfectly acceptable for a three-row SUV; The main things I remember from our drive were my companions, the endless vistas, and the comfy seats, and that’s what I wanted to remember. Kia has not built a vehicle meant to take the spotlight; 1,000 horsepower may grab headlines, but my friends are what I want to focus on during a road trip. The EV9’s silent excellence complements day-to-day living, and it has shown a path forward for electrification in the process.
The sole snag on the journey didn’t come from the EV9 at all, but rather the dire charging infrastructure of America. I planned to stop in Forks, Washington—about 50 miles from Kalaloch—to top up the EV9’s battery, which had roughly 80 miles of charge left on it. While Kalaloch had chargers proclaimed on their website, I couldn’t be certain they’d all be working (or unoccupied). I didn’t want to get a press car completely stranded on the Pacific Coast without any cell service. Luckily, Forks had two sets of DC fast chargers.
Unluckily, that pair was a Tesla Supercharger and a Rivian Adventure Network station. Kia—which has announced a transition to NACS charging ports, but is still using CCS until the end of the year—isn’t including adapters on ‘24 models. I never thought to check this before leaving home and realized my charging-kit bag in the frunk had nothing to help me when I was standing at the Supercharger.
I had read about Rivian opening these once-locked-down DC fast chargers to every EV owner shortly before I embarked on the trip. What I didn’t remember was that those plans were for the back half of 2024. I arrived at the Rivian charger, attempted to plug in and scan a QR code, and the charging station let me know that it wouldn’t be dispensing a drop of juice to my Kia.
One panic attack later, I decided to forge onward to the lodge. Worst-case scenario, we’d make it to the hotel, but go without the car for a day while it trickle-charged on an outlet to give us enough juice to limp it to an actual charger. When we arrived at Kalaloch, I raced to the back of the lot and found the Level 2 chargers. All four were unoccupied, and three of them even worked. Crisis averted—but not before my choice of an EV had shaved a few years off my life from stress.
The rest of the trip proceeded without incident. We visited one of the only unspoiled temperate rainforests on the continent, saw tide pools full of starfish and anemones at Ruby Beach, and had a bonfire together on the shore of the Pacific. It felt like an ideal family vacation; I simply had chosen the family this time.
On the drive home, we stopped at the Satsop Nuclear Plant. Satsop was partially completed in the ‘80s by the Washington Public Power Supply System, but massive cost overruns led to voters pulling the plug before the plant was ever completed. The gargantuan cooling towers and reactor dome still loom over the small town of Elma, Washington; A business park has sprung up in their shadow, but there is no power generated.
When we arrived, it was overcast. The vacant gray landscape and looming towers, ordinarily, would feel post-apocalyptic to me. I’ve written a lot of fiction about the end of the world; It is the main thing I fixate on after a life of running from one hostile place to another, constantly struggling to stay ahead of seeming disaster. But despite the tumult America has experienced over the past decades, there are still pristine beaches. There are still ancient rainforests. I still ran on the sand with my friends. We can preserve these things because we have preserved these things despite all odds against them.
There is work to be done, to be sure. Electric vehicles will not cure our woes magically. But just as the waters of the Puget Sound were not cleaned overnight, America will not find its footing in a single election, charging will not improve without investment, and the way Americans relate to their cars—and move towards electrification–cannot change without effort.What this trip did show me, however, is a glimpse of a world where we can do it. We can still avoid the precipice and we have the building blocks to do it. We just have to keep trying.

E-Fuels Can't Work In Cars Until They Work In Planes. Here's Why,https://www.motor1.com/news/705067/efuels-future-explained/,HIF USA CEO Renato Pereira says his company can't rely on individuals to fill up on E-fuels at the pump.,12/25/2024 8:52,"At a time when wholesale EV adoption seems imminent, E-fuels represent a ray of hope for internal-combustion enthusiasts worldwide. In theory, an affordable, sustainable, readily available, and clean-burning fuel means internal combustion engines could live on indefinitely.
Just one problem; While E-fuels are already in production, it'll be ages before you can buy some at your local gas station.
""Right now, the costs [of producing E-fuels] are high,"" HIF USA CEO Renato Pereira tells Motor1. ""The costs are high because the equipment is new. That's brand new technology.""
HIF, or Highly Innovative Fuels, describes itself as the world's leading E-fuels company. It produces carbon-neutral fuels in several countries, intended for use in cars, boats, and planes. HIF's proprietary mixture, produced from hydrogen and CO₂ using wind energy, can run through gas-powered cars without any modifications to the engine, making it an appealing choice for enthusiasts who want to enjoy their internal combustion engines in an environmentally friendly manner.
It's a tantalizing idea, but reaching the point where HIF's E-fuels are cheap enough to offer to the masses is still likely years away, as the means to produce, store, and distribute the fuels are in their earliest phases. Average buyers can't subsidize the construction of these expensive production facilities; they'll demand an affordable, finalized product which doesn't yet exist.
""If you're an individual like you or me, you can say, 'I'm willing to pay a little bit more money [for E-fuel over conventional gasoline].' But we can't rely on that for the construction,"" Pereira tells Motor1. ""We either need a system through regulation or we need to support the construction of these production facilities [through investment] so that the costs can come down,""
""Every time you build a new facility, the cost goes down,"" he says.
Because these production facilities can take up to five years to build, HIF needs partners who are willing to commit to higher costs up front, before the facility is built.
""In order to build [these factories], we need a long-term commitment at a fixed price,"" says Pereira. ""So we need somebody to say, 'I'll pay you this amount for this fuel for 15 or 20 years,' and then we can rely on that commitment to go to the banks so they can lend us the money for those facilities.""
Porsche has pioneered in the E-fuel sector. The German carmaker has invested more than $100 Million into HIF Global since 2021 in return for a long-term stake. The money helped fund HIF's proof-of-concept facility in Chile. As a proof of concept, and to generate publicity, Porsche has used the clean-burning fuel in many of its special projects. On one recent expedition to the world’s highest volcano, Porsche set a record for reaching the highest altitude driven, courtesy of a highly modified 911 Carrera 4S running on E-fuel.
“We see ourselves as pioneers in E-fuels and want to drive the technology,” Porsche R&D board member Michael Steiner said in a 2022 statement. ""This is one building block in our clear, overall sustainability strategy.""
But it's not cars where the first proper E-fuels are poised to be used at scale, says Pereira. It's in ""no alternative"" modes of transportation, like transatlantic shipping boats and passenger airliners, where full-on electric propulsion adoption is extremely unlikely. It's in these industries where E-fuels have the biggest environmental benefit, as no massive investment to modify the existing methods of propulsion is needed.
Governments are beginning to realize the benefits. The European Union mandated that sustainable fuels should make up at least six percent of fuel pumped in its airports by 2030. By the year 2050, that number is required to be 70 percent. In the United States, a $1.25-per-gallon credit is awarded for sustainable fuel blends that reduce emissions by at least 50 percent.
""We have a clear market that we can serve,"" Pereira says.
Ironically, it's not the airlines themselves committing to these long-term agreements with companies like HIF, but rather traditional oil firms.
""The burden is mostly on the fuel distribution companies, the oil companies, because they're the ones who supply the fuel at the airports,"" Pereira tells Motor1. ""So we're going to them and saying, 'I have this fuel, please sign up on a long term agreement at this price that enables us to build this facility.'""
The hope for car enthusiasts, then, is that enough investment and government regulation leads to more factories, and in turn, proliferation of E-fuels. If ""no-alternative"" modes of gas-powered transportation (i.e. planes and boats) are pushed to E-fuels, either through regulation or market forces, prices will drop for all consumers.
Long-term, E-fuel manufacturers strive to reach a point where E-fuels are cheap enough to match or even beat conventional gasoline prices; It's the only scenario where E-fuels would be widely adopted by individuals, barring government intervention.
Considering the sloth-like progress of lawmaking and the length of time necessary to construct E-fuel production facilities, it's going to take a while for E-fuels to become mainstream. Pereira isn't sure when you might be able to pump your own sustainable fuel. Probably years but maybe decades. We'll be here, car keys in hand, eagerly waiting.

This Is Our First Look At Ferrari's New EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/724712/ferrari-ev-spy-photos/,Complete with comically fake exhaust tips.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Ferrari announced in late 2019 that it would not introduce its first electric car until after the middle of this decade. However, the market launch was moved forward in April 2021 when company chairman John Elkann said the car would come out by 2025. It's still on track for an official debut late next year. In the meantime, it might've been spied undergoing testing for the first time.
This strangely disguised test mule spotted by Derek Cornelissen looks like an oversized hatchback. Spotted in Maranello, the unusual vehicle appears to be wearing a modified body sourced from the Maserati Levante. However, it seems to have the headlights of a Ferrari Roma. We also can't help but notice the newly designed wheels, possibly missing the aero covers.
And yes, those quad exhaust tips hanging from the corners of the rear bumper are comically fake. The yellow high-voltage stickers indicate we are dealing with an electric vehicle. It's not the first time an automaker decides to slap a faux exhaust on an EV prototype as Porsche has been doing that for a while with the electric Boxster.
Just because Ferrari decided to use a Levante body doesn't necessarily mean the V-12-powered Purosangue is getting an electric companion. The company with the Prancing Horse has not revealed which shape its EV will take. We do know the mysterious car will be built at a new factory inaugurated this week at the existing base in Maranello. Seeing this test mule running around mere days after is probably not a coincidence.
Ferrari has promised its first EV will deliver an ""authentic"" noise, whatever that means. The car is rumored to cost over $500,000 per Reuters, although CEO Benedetto Vigna refused this week to confirm the report. He also refuted speculation claiming the new factory would push annual production from approximately 14,000 to 20,000 vehicles.
Although Ferrari is at the dawn of the electric era, it still plans to sell V-12 cars for as long as possible. Head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando recently said the twelve-cylinder powerhouse will remain in production until it is outlawed. However, the Italian exotic marque projects pure ICE cars will account for only 20 percent of annual sales by 2030. About 40 percent will be represented by plug-in hybrids, with the remaining 40 percent by pure EVs.
Meanwhile, the first EV is estimated to account for five percent of total shipments in 2026. Reuters alleges that a second electric car is in the works already, albeit in an early development stage.

Mitsubishi Might Bring Back the Lancer Sportback and Montero,https://www.motor1.com/news/724146/mitsubishi-lancer-sportback-montero-return/,But they'll probably be EVs.,12/25/2024 8:52,"In 2017, Mitsubishi revived its iconic Eclipse nameplate and promptly slapped it on the backside of an SUV. Sad. Now we're seeing new trademark filings for other iconic Mitsubishi names, like Montero and Lancer Sportback, that could also end up on unappealing models.
The former Montero nameplate hasn't been around in the US since 2006, but Mitsubishi recently filed a trademark for the Montero name with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The trademark specifies “automobiles” and dozens of other uses, so it's possible we could see the Montero name on a future Mitsubishi here in the US.
Mitsubishi filed a second trademark for ""Lancer Sportback"" that was initially refused by the USPTO, but is currently under appeal. The Lancer Sportback was the five-door version of the Lancer in the US that was introduced in 2010. This trademark appeal was filed in March, and specifies use for “automobiles and structural parts therefor.”
The Lancer Sportback trademark filing is especially interesting. We know that Mitsubishi is teaming up with Nissan to bring a handful of new hybrid and electric models to the US, including its own version of the next-generation Leaf. Rumors say the Lancer Sportback could be Mitsubishi’s version of the Leaf (if the patent is granted).
There are also rumors of a new Mitsubishi truck for the US and a production version of the D:X Concept (which could become the next Delica). But we’re taking all of these details with a grain of salt. We won’t know anything for sure until the first new Mitsubishi models start rolling off the production line sometime in 2025 for the 2026 model year.

I Designed A Hybrid Car. Now I'm Building It In My Garage,https://www.motor1.com/features/724024/lets-build-a-car/,Technology has put us on the brink of building an automobile with almost zero hard tooling. Let’s try it.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Eight years ago, I began a college degree in industrial design. I did it because I loved cars. It didn’t work out how I thought. About halfway through my degree, I realized that I didn’t want to design just the interior or exterior of a vehicle; I wanted to design the whole thing. As it turns out, that’s a gig that doesn’t really exist.
I finished my degree, pivoted my career out of design, and now I work as a journalist, writing about machines that extremely talented people have toiled over for years.
And there is a massive car-shaped hole in my life. Let’s change that.
I am going to build a car.
This project will be a little different than other custom cars because I will not be starting with an existing vehicle or fabricating almost any of the parts. Rapid prototyping technology has come very far in a very short time. Making an entire vehicle with almost zero hard tooling is possible. At least a lightweight hybrid sports car. If that sounds unreasonable, well, let me talk you into it.
Assuming it works, this vehicle will effectively be an open-source kit car, theoretically buildable by almost anyone with a garage and the right tools. Every single part will have a precise specification and a supplier. Let’s talk about the actual specs, though.
The bones of this vehicle, like its chassis and suspension, will be custom. The engine, transmission, electric motor, and differentials are not. There are a handful of great engine candidates out there, but one in particular became the favorite: The 1.6-liter straight-six out of a BMW K1600 motorcycle. Many have theorized about putting this engine in a car and I know a few who have actually done it.
The BMW straight-six is a great engine. It makes 160 horsepower via natural aspiration, has a six-speed sequential transmission, and revs out to 8,500 RPM. There are other good things about it too, but the sound and the power are the big ones. Think of it as half of the almighty BMW S54, which powered the E46 M3 from 2001-2006.
The 1.6-liter inline-six out of a BMW K1600 motorcycle
Because I chose this engine, getting the car working will be considerably harder. The most well-rounded candidate would’ve been a flat-four out of a Honda Goldwing. There are several advantages to using a Goldwing engine—especially an older carbureted one—over the six-cylinder in the K1600. However, I wanted to be sure that the internal-combustion drivetrain would be excellent regardless of the electric side of things. Many sporty hybrid cars get that wrong and I will not make that mistake.
A K1600 engine—purchased from eBay with around 20,000 miles on it—is now sitting in my garage. But there’s a big problem: It spins in the wrong direction compared to a car engine. Without addressing this problem, I would have six reverse gears and effectively no way to go forward. This is simultaneously a huge issue but also a pretty silly one.
There are several solutions, but I’ll simply be flipping my rear differential over to make it run backward, i.e. twisting it about the input shaft to put one output flange where the other used to be. A lot of people online say this is a bad idea. That’s almost the whole truth. I have spoken to people who have done it for other projects involving motorcycle engines and, as long as you use a strong differential, it should be fine for this sort of thing. I also spoke to an engineer at General Motors who has spent most of his career just designing gears—a very happy coincidence—and he said it’s ok to do as long as everything stays well-lubricated.
This engine will run on a standalone ECU, which I have never tuned with before. I have spoken to experts in the matter—aka the very helpful people from whom I plan to purchase the system—and they say it’s definitely possible. Stuff like the cam sensors, fuel injectors, and the crank trigger wheel all seem relatively conventional.
Let’s talk about the other half of this formula, though: the electric power.
You’ve probably heard of the E-Ray Corvette by now, and my kart is conceptually very similar. My front axle will be powered by an electric motor, a 35.0-kilowatt-capable unit that’s normally used in electric paramotor aircraft. It’s made by a company called Free RC Hobby, which is sponsoring this project. They offer several other more powerful motors that I could’ve used—and even controllers—but this one is lightweight and has the right characteristics to be hooked up to an automotive differential.
The 35-kilowatt motor, designed and built by Free RC Hobby, is typically used in electric paramotor aircraft. Its specifications make it ideal for lightweight cars as well
The front diff is out of an Audi A4. It provides a reduction gear and gets the power to the front wheels. I considered using two motors on the front axle—there are advantages to doing this—but a single motor is the best option for this application. I’ll cover this in a future installment, but in the meantime, if you see me at a bar, it’s best not to mention this stuff. I’ll talk for days.
Juice comes from a 72-volt nominal, 1.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack consisting of 30 prismatic lithium titanate cells in a 30S 1P configuration. It’s the big blue rectangle in the lead image. Made by Toshiba, Mazda uses the same cells in some of their vehicles’ mild hybrid systems.
Mazda uses these Toshiba LTO cells, also known as SCiBs, in some of their vehicle's mild hybrid systems. They're ideal for my purposes due to their high power density and stability
I’ve partially assembled this pack and it’s a very impressive unit on paper. It can push around 40 kW (53 horsepower) in a long burst, and charge quickly. Because of the relatively low voltage, the electric power will peter out around 50 miles per hour. With some modification—changing the motor or differential—this speed can be pushed higher at the cost of low-end performance. I’m happy with where the motor sits now, though. High speeds are not my priority as a matter of personal preference and safety.
Like the E-Ray, the pack sits in the vehicle’s structural center tunnel, which is a six-inch square aluminum tube. A ducted high-CFM radiator fan will allow for powerful air cooling through the tunnel and around the pack, but there’s space to add liquid cooling in the future if necessary.
The 1.4-kilowatt-hour pack sits at the front of the center tunnel, near the rest of the electric drivetrain
The great part about these LTO cells is they have a much lower internal resistance as compared to NMC lithium-ion cells, so they don’t get so hot under high current draws. They are also extremely safe—you can hammer a nail into them without much happening—and they can be cycled up to 20,000 times before significant degradation occurs. They’re a great hybrid battery candidate for these reasons and more, with the big caveat being energy density. I don’t need very much energy, though.
The key piece of this puzzle is the inverter to drive the motor. When you go to higher voltages, that becomes a more complex problem. I am avoiding this by nature of the vehicle, though, which I’ll expand on.
As of late, there are good candidates from Flipsky and Trampa that operate under 100V. They are all VESC-based which means the software is the same as what I have been using in the Motocompacto Type R and the quad-motor kart. I plan to have the inverter cooled by a large heatsink that resembles a shaker hood. I think that’s a cool way to show off the electric power. If this doesn’t work, I’ll cave and add radiators.
72V may sound like too little, even for a hybrid. That’s not the case. There are many excellent reasons to mate a relatively low-voltage hybrid system with a motorcycle engine in a car. The big one is that most motorcycles don’t have a reverse gear, and when people put bike engines in cars, they typically have to buy an expensive gearbox to compensate or improvise some kind of other solution. My electric drivetrain gives me a reverse gear, effectively.
Small motorcycle alternators may also struggle to provide the necessary juice to power lots of accessories. The K1600’s alternator is 700 watts, which should be plenty, but by placing a DC-DC converter between the car’s 12V battery and its 72V traction battery, you can use regenerated energy from the wheels to power onboard systems like cooling fans in a pinch.
A sealed DC-DC converter, made by Elcon, will enable the traction battery to send up to 1000W to the vehicle's 12V systems under high-load situations
There are other good reasons to go hybrid too, like less wear on the bike engine’s clutch starting off. The most compelling reason to do all of this is not technical, though.
All of this will make the car more fun to drive.
While interesting, most hybrid systems in production cars don’t provide the driver any ability to interact with or adjust the electric power delivery to their liking. This vehicle will not be like that. The level of regenerative braking and output power from the motor will be adjustable on the fly. I already know how to do this.
The way the electric power is put down, i.e. when and how the driver decides to use the selected power level, will also be configurable. I’m still deciding the best way to do that, whether it’s a sort of shift paddle, a button on the steering wheel, or integrated somehow with the throttle pedal. In the end, integrating this functionality is not conceptually complex; it is just something that must be iterated upon.
The end result is an 8,500 RPM straight-six combined with a separate electric drivetrain that can be tuned to a user’s liking. The vehicle will likely be able to start like an LMDh car, accelerating up to speed under electric power and then bumping over the combustion engine. I’m not sure how pleasant that will be, but ultimately it will be up to the driver to start like that if they desire.
Since the car is light, the electric drivetrain can be light, too. My whole battery pack weighs less than 40 pounds, my motor weighs less than 12 lbs, and the inverter weighs less than 10 lbs. The heaviest parts of this vehicle by far are the combustion engine and differentials.
This is the magic. The car is already light because it’s small and powered by a motorcycle engine (the combined engine and transmission weigh just 226 lbs). The shortcomings of the motorcycle combustion setup are largely overcome by a hybrid system which, by the nature of the vehicle it’s installed in, can likewise be small and lightweight. The value this has for inverter selection should also not be understated. Going over 100V means getting into the territory of much more expensive and complicated hardware. I don’t need to do that because of my low power requirements.
On paper, it all adds up in a really nice way.
Until about a year ago, the chassis part of this vehicle would’ve been untenable. A big part of this project is that I want to do very little fabrication personally. This will make it less about my own personal skill and allow everything to be repeatable for inspired readers. I think other people who are smarter than me can expand on this idea even more.
If this method of production sounds silly, well, it just isn’t anymore. The same sponsor of both the Motocompacto Type R and the quad-motor kart, Oshcut, can laser-cut square tubes big enough to make a complete aluminum chassis. In fact, my current progress is shown below. The only chassis component I will have to source from a different manufacturer is the roll cage. If you know of a business that can help me out with that, let me know.
The chassis consists of several bolted and bonded aluminum tubes. Some are not displayed in this image
The frame will be bolted and bonded together, similar to many other modern automotive structures. Small amounts of steel are located in key areas and will be coated or painted to prevent galvanic corrosion. The suspension, double wishbones at every corner, will have steel control arms, likely a mix of small metal 3D prints and laser-cut tubes, although I’m still iterating on this. Pushrod suspension is a convenient way to make space for the CV axles, which will have to be custom.
Body panels will be 3D-printed on a large-format FDM or SLA machine. The price of this technology has come down precipitously in just a few years. Pieces like the door skins can be printed in a single shot, without gluing any smaller prints together. Larger pieces like the hood and rear clamshell are separated into smaller panels. These parts will either be primed and painted as they are or, more likely, skinned with a composite material like fiberglass to add strength. I have already gotten reasonable quotes for these pieces, but I am looking for as many as I can, especially in the United States. Please reach out if you know of one.
Below is a preview of the basic design, which I had rendered by a talented digital artist. The actual CAD of the body is changing as the design matures, so I don’t want to share exactly what it looks like at a granular level. At least not yet. It will look very close to what you see now, though:
I could go on, but this is just a primer. For the sake of (some semblance of) brevity, I won't discuss the interior in this post; That will be an exciting topic for a separate piece.
As I progress, there will be several more journal-type features about vehicle development. These updates will be large and small, sometimes written and sometimes presented via other mediums.
This whole idea probably sounds wildly optimistic, and I may seem unaware of the trouble that’s ahead of me.
You’re right.
I didn’t know how hard this would be when I started, and I cannot anticipate how difficult the path ahead is. For every problem I face, though, I do not find myself discouraged. I find learning and problem-solving to be absolutely thrilling.

The Electric BMW M3 Will 'Beat Everything',https://www.motor1.com/news/724126/electric-bmw-m3-beat-everything/,BMW M CEO Frank van Meel is eager to take advantage of the sedan's quad-motor setup.,12/25/2024 8:52,"While some automakers are changing their EV plans, BMW is marching ahead. The company will launch models using its Neue Klasse platform in a few years, including its high-performance M cars. Those worried about the move to electrification should feel some relief from BMW M CEO Frank van Meel, who claimed that the electric M3 will ""beat everything.""
He told Motor Trend that he is eager to take advantage of the car's quad-motor configuration due to the ability to control the drivetrain and the chassis ""with one central logic,"" creating a ""neutral, linear, and predictable"" performance car that should have the power to, well, beat everything.
BMW Neue Klasse EV Concept
Frank Weber, BMW's head of engineering and R&D, has already hinted at the car making one megawatt of power, or 1,341 horsepower. The M car will feature unique battery chemistry and cooling, in-house designed e-motors, an 800-volt architecture, and special software to run it all.
The automaker is also considering a lighter rear-wheel-drive variant that offers a different driving experience. Half the motors likely mean half the power and 670 hp is still a lot. We might also get an electric M3 Touring riding on the new architecture, but all the fun stuff is still a few years away. The Neue Klasse-based 3 Series arrives in 2026, followed by the M3 in 2027. The wagon would likely come after that, closer to the decade's end.
How much will this super-machine cost? We don't know, but we hope the price doesn't also beat everything we have ever seen. Bold cars backed by bold claims often come with equally bold price tags

2026 Bugatti Tourbillon: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/723757/2026-bugatti-tourbillion-debut-specs/,"It has 16 cylinders, 3 electric motors, and a top speed of 276 miles per hour.",12/25/2024 8:52,"This is not another Bugatti Chiron derivative. There's certainly a striking resemblance to the old W-16-powered hypercar, but this a completely new beast. The monocoque is new. The suspension is new. And the hybrid V-16 powertrain is most definitely new. Say hello to Bugatti's next-generation 1,800-horsepower flagship, the Tourbillon.
The previous reports about the engine were true—this is an 8.3-liter monster that revs to 9,500 RPM and makes 1,000 horsepower without any turbochargers. Cosworth helped develop the naturally aspirated beast, which weighs just 555 pounds despite being significantly larger than the W-16 it replaces. There's also 664 pound-feet of torque, but of greater interest here is the other half of the Tourbillon's powertrain.
We're talking about the hybrid assistance. A front e-axle carries two electric motors, with a third motor positioned at the back to help spin the rear wheels. A 25 kWh centrally-mounted battery pack supplies power, adding 800 hp to the mix. The combined output is 1,800 hp, and provided the bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have enough grip, the Tourbillon will reach 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.0 seconds.
But that's not a proper metric to convey the Tourbillon's true performance. Under full throttle, 124 mph is reached in around 5.0 seconds. 186 mph arrives in a mere 10 seconds. The top speed of 236 mph happens in less than 25 seconds, unless you have the special Speed Key installed. When activated, the Tourbillon keeps its ginormous rear wing hunkered down while the speed climbs all the way to 276 mph.
The latest Bugatti doesn't lose anything in becoming a hybrid, except a little bit of weight. Yes, despite a battery pack and electric motors, Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron. It can also cruise around town without using that snazzy V-16 engine. Actually, it can go beyond town with an estimated EV range of 37 miles. There's no mention of speed on electric power, and Bugatti isn't ready to talk about charging times. But it uses an 800-volt system, and lest we forget, Mate Rimac is steering Bugatti these days. And he knows a thing or two about electric performance.
Watch connoisseurs will recognize tourbillon as mechanical bits used in high-quality timepieces to increase accuracy. Bugatti sees its Tourbillon as a big, timeless work of mechanical perfection. That becomes readily apparent when you open the electrically actuated dihedral doors to see the stunning analog interior. Three large dials affixed to the steering wheel display everything from speed to engine revs, fuel quantity, engine temperature, and more. There isn't a screen in sight.
The gauges were designed and crafted by Switch watchmakers, and they're permanently fixed to the steering column so they remain stationary as you turn the wheel. Meanwhile in the center console, you'll find banks of aluminum switches, rotary dials, and a single crystal lever that starts the V-16. The purpose of all this is to give the Tourbillon a timeless look, but there is a hidden digital screen at the top of the center console. On command, it will rotate up and give the driver access to Apple CarPlay, among other things.
As for the design, there's no mistaking it for a Bugatti. The Chiron-esque exterior features a special diffuser that begins just behind the passenger cabin, virtually hidden from view. Vents under the headlights help funnel air to the large side intakes. The horseshoe grille feeds air to radiators while also augmenting downforce. The active rear wing can deploy upward to serve as an airbrake. And it all rides on a completely new multi-link suspension that is 45 percent lighter compared to the Chiron's bones.
""The development of the Bugatti Tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of Bugatti history and the words of Ettore Bugatti himself,"" said Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac. ""His mantras ‘if comparable it is no longer Bugatti’ and ‘nothing is too beautiful’ were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the Bugatti hyper sports car story.""
Though we're seeing the car today, that era won't begin until 2026 when the first of 250 production cars will be delivered. Right now, the Tourbillon is currently in its testing phase, so start saving those pennies. You'll need every single one, because the Tourbillon's starting price is 3.6 million Euros (around $3.9 million at current exchange rates).

This Tiny EV Destroyed A Mercedes-AMG One Track Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/723933/mcmurtry-speirling-hockenheim-record/,It was 14.1 seconds quicker around Hockenheim.,12/25/2024 8:52,"With a lap time of 1 minute and 38.5 seconds, the Mercedes-AMG One is the fastest production car with a license plate around Hockenheim. However, it's no longer the fastest car overall around the challenging German track because the tiny but mighty McMurtry Speirling has shaved off a whopping 14.1 seconds. It completed a lap of the Grand Prix (GP) course in 1 minute and 24.4 seconds.
The diminutive EV has been crowned the fastest closed-wheel car around Hockenheim after beating not just the AMG One, but even a DTM race car. It improved the old record established in 2020 during a qualifying session for the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters by 3.9 seconds.
But it's not exactly a fair comparison since the Speirling is a purpose-built, track-only machine with a single seat and racing slicks. Nevertheless, it's an impressive feat considering the AMG One is essentially an F1 car for the road while the other is a DTM-spec racing machine. Not only that, but the pint-sized electric car only utilized 75 percent of available power and downforce since the run was done with a validation prototype.
The hot lap was performed on June 8 with former F1 driver Max Chilton behind the wheel. He also set the lap record at the Goodwood Festival of Speed while piloting the very same ultra-fast EV. He completed the hill climb course a couple of years ago in a blistering 39 seconds that will be hard to beat.
At 135.8 inches long, 62.2 inches wide, and just 40.1 inches tall, it makes the Miata look like a Super Duty by comparison. It weighs less than 2,200 pounds, so it’s even lighter than an ND-generation MX-5 while packing roughly five times more horsepower. McMurtry quotes a peak output of around 1,000 horsepower, all of which is channeled to the rear wheels.
While the range isn’t mentioned, it's not really all that relevant since the sole purpose of this car is to deliver neck-snapping acceleration. Although it’s a microscopic vehicle, the engineers have crammed in a 60-kWh battery the owners can charge in less than 20 minutes. We're being told that a fully juiced-up battery lasts for 10 laps of Silverstone at full throttle.
Having access to this ludicrous performance doesn't come cheap as the McMurtry Spéirling costs a whopping £895,000 before taxes and delivery fees. At current exchange rates, you’re looking at about $1.13 million. Only 100 units will be made and the plan is to start deliveries to customers in 2025.

The Electric Ferrari Could Cost Over Half A Million Dollars,https://www.motor1.com/news/723799/electric-ferrari-price-rumor/,Another EV is reportedly in the works.,12/25/2024 8:52,"The best-kept secret in Maranello these days is the Ferrari EV. The first Prancing Horse without a combustion engine remains almost a complete mystery. All we know so far is that it will be built at a new factory in the company's hometown and is scheduled to come out in the last quarter of 2025. Reuters has heard from sources familiar with the matter the electric Italian stallion will cost at least €500,000.
That works out to about $537,000 at current exchange rates. However, prices vary greatly around the world due to regional taxes, so a direct conversion isn't always accurate. Whatever the case may be, the rumored asking price is for the base version, but hardly any owners buy a Ferrari with zero options. The alleged asking price converted to dollars would make it roughly as expensive as a regular SF90 Stradale, not the hardcore $890,000 XX.
Reuters' source has also heard through the grapevine that a second Ferrari EV has already entered an early development stage. After the Purosangue SUV and the first electric model, adding yet another model to the lineup might hurt exclusivity. To avoid brand dilution, it is believed the company intends to limit production to no more than 20,000 vehicles annually, at least for a while.
Sales have gone up consistently year after year, reaching 13,663 units in 2023. People are willing to patiently wait years to take delivery. Last November, CEO Benedetto Vigna mentioned that the order books were at record levels, so much so that the production output for 2025 had already been sold out. It means newly placed orders won't be fulfilled until 2026 at the earliest.
To avoid becoming an SUV brand, Ferrari has limited annual production of the Purosangue to 20 percent of the total output. The high-riding model starts at around $400,000 and would likely sell even better without any restrictions in production. With a new plant on the way, more cars will roll off the assembly line. The most exciting of the lot will be a hypercar expected to break cover later this year.
As for the inaugural EV, Ferrari head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando recently said it'll have an ""authentic sound"" and will be a ""true Ferrari."" In 2026, the unnamed model is projected to account for about five percent of total sales. EVs are expected to represent 40 percent of all annual shipments by 2030.

"Ford's 1,400-HP Electric SuperTruck Could Break a Pikes Peak Record",https://www.motor1.com/news/723624/ford-lightning-supertruck-pikes-peak-powertrain/,The automaker beat the previous record last year by nearly 37 seconds.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Ford hopes to set another record at this year’s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The automaker beat the previous record by nearly 37 seconds last year in the SuperVan 4.2, and the company is returning with the F-150 Lightning SuperTruck. Ford showed off its wild aerodynamics late last month and now has details about the EV’s powertrain.
The SuperTruck used three STARD UHP 6-Phase Motors that make more than 1,400 horsepower combined, more than the SuperVan 4.2 that Ford campaigned at last year’s event. However, it sounds like it’s below the SuperVan 4.0, which made 1,972 hp. Power comes from an ultra-high-performance Li-Polymer NMC battery.
Ford replaced the truck’s camouflage wrap with a proper red, white, and blue livery, and its design screams extreme aerodynamics. The automaker claims the pickup can generate 6,000 pounds of downforce at 150 miles per hour.
The Ford features prominent aerodynamic features such as its colossal three-piece front splitter and the gigantic, swan-neck rear wing. It also has ducts where the headlights should be, side diffusers, hood ducts and louvers, and a massive rear diffuser that barely hides the fully custom, in-board suspension system. Pirelli P-Zero tires, wrapped around magnesium forged wheels, provide the grip, with carbon-ceramic brakes behind them.
It’s also all business inside the Lightning, where there’s a bare carbon-fiber floor, a racing seat, a steering wheel, a small display, and not much else. A makeshift center console holds two rows of buttons that control various vehicle functions.
Racing driver Romain Dumas will pilot Ford’s entry once again. He drove the SuperVan 4.2 up the course last year, setting the new record in the Open Class with a run of 8 minutes and 47.682 seconds. Ford should set a new record with more power on tap in the SuperTruck. The hillclimb happens on June 23.

The New Fiat Grande Panda Proves Fun Designs Aren't Dead,https://www.motor1.com/news/723316/2025-fiat-grande-panda-debut/,It comes with a choice of hybrid or electric power.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Although Fiat's European lineup is aging, at least it's significantly more diverse than what we get here in the United States. Aside from the 500 and 500X, there's also the Tipo hatchback and wagon. There are also hot Abarth models, like the 600X crossover, and the cutesy Panda. The latter is now joined by the new Grande Panda, a larger and mechanically different vehicle.
The Grande Panda is an addition to the family rather than a replacement for the current Panda, which will stick around until at least 2027, at which point it will have been 16 years old. As the name of the newcomer implies, it’s much grander than the old car. It’s 157 inches long, making it about 12 inches longer than the third-generation Panda launched all the way back in 2011.
It's still a diminutive car by American standards but considerably more substantial than before. The jump in size is not a real surprise since the boxy crossover is essentially Fiat's version of the new Citroen C3 sold in Europe. It looks a lot funkier than its French connection, sending concept car vibes even though this is a production model.
The cheerful Fiat Grande Panda embraces the pixel motif that might make you think of a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Those front LED daytime running lights have a chequered pattern. It's a recurring theme that you'll also notice inside the taillights. The Italian brand went to town with squares and 90-degree angles, which is refreshing to see in an automotive world dominated by swoopy designs and curvy lines.
Those 17-inch wheels with a diamond-cut design have a central ""X"" to compliment the light signature at the front and rear. Plastic cladding around the wheel arches makes the Grande Panda look more rugged, as do the chunky roof rails. Rather than using an old-fashioned badge at the back, an oversized Fiat script is debossed into the tailgate. The Panda lettering is hiding in plain sight on that black horizontal strip connecting the taillights.
The Grande Panda will be sold with hybrid and electric powertrains, presumably the same ones available for the Citroen C3. Expect a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine with three cylinders, a mild-hybrid setup, and a dual-clutch, six-speed automatic transmission. The gas is good for 100 horsepower while the electric motor provides a temporary boost of 28 hp. However, that e-motor only delivers 12 hp during acceleration.
The fully electric Grande Panda might inherit the 113-hp motor from the e-C3, along with its 44.0-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for a 199-mile range. Citroen also intends to sell a cheaper 124-mile e-C3 from 2025.
The Grande Panda won’t be a Euro-only affair as Fiat wants to sell the new model in the Middle East and Africa as well.

The First Electric Ferrari Will Deliver An 'Authentic' Noise,https://www.motor1.com/news/722841/ferrari-ev-authentic-noise/,But what is left after you remove the combustion engine?,12/25/2024 8:52,"It's been a little over three years since Ferrari did the unthinkable by announcing plans to launch an electric car. The first Prancing Horse with zero emissions is still on track for a late 2025 launch and it will make some noise, both literally and figuratively. Despite completely doing away with the ol' internal combustion engine, the EV from Maranello won't be completely silent.
While some electric cars such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N make fake combustion engine noises and even have simulated gear changes, Ferrari is hinting at something different. Speaking with Australia's Drive magazine, Ferrari head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando mentioned ""[the sound is] always authentic in a Ferrari."" He added it'll be a ""true Ferrari,"" although it's unclear what sort of sound it's going to produce.
The only way it's going to be an ""authentic” sound is if Ferrari is referring to the whine of the electric motor. The engineers could amplify it through the speakers, but that wouldn't be completely authentic anymore, would it? Whatever the soundtrack it will deliver, Maranello's first foray into the EV segment is set to ""deliver different emotions"" compared to the current crop of models.
An electric car is a huge deal, so it's understandable why Ferrari remains tight-lipped for now. It hasn't even announced what shape it will take but we do know it's going to be built at a new production site that's being finalized these days at home in Maranello. The unnamed model is projected to account for five percent of the company’s sales in 2026–the EV's first full year on sale.
The arrival of an EV won't seal the V-12's fate since Ferrari intends to keep the twelve-cylinder engine around until it is outlawed. Carando assures enthusiasts that deep-pocketed owners will be the ones who will decide whether they want a pure gas engine, a plug-in hybrid, or an EV.
Ferrari will beat archrival Lamborghini to the electric punch considering the latter won't launch the Lanzador, a 2+2 grand tourer, until 2028. By the end of the decade, Ferrari reckons 40 percent of its annual sales will be represented by cars without a combustion engine.

VW Will Spend Billions of Its EV Development Budget on Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/722457/vw-invest-billions-gas-engines/,A full third of its nine-figure EV budget will be used to keep gas engines relevant as the switch to EVs slows.,12/25/2024 8:52,"It's fair to say the transition to EVs isn't going as some automakers had projected. Several car manufacturers are delaying their lofty goals to become purely electric in the foreseeable future. Of the €180 billion ($196 billion) set aside in 2023 for research and development, the German brand said it would use more than two-thirds on ""electrification and digitalization.""
Arno Antlitz, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer at the Volkswagen Group, has now clarified where the remaining third will be spent. The company intends to invest roughly €60 billion ($65 billion) to ""keep our combustion cars competitive.""
Speaking at an event held by Reuters in Munich, the CFO and COO added that ""the future is electric, but the past is not over. It is a third and it will stay a third."" As a reminder, the previous plan announced in late 2022 mentioned VW would go fully electric in Europe from 2033.
Last year, VW brand boss Thomas Schäfer referred to ICE as being ""old technology"" in the context of e-fuels. He described the discussions surrounding synthetic fuels as being nothing more than ""unnecessary noise."" That's despite the fact fellow VW Group brand Porsche is actively involved in producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile.
Other high-end marques from the VW empire are also keeping a close eye on how sustainable fuels evolve. Bugatti is even thinking of designing fuel stations that could be installed at the owner's home and filled up with synthetic fuel. Lamborghini believes the combustion engine could be saved by making it run on something other than fossil fuels. Bentley is also exploring nearly carbon-neutral fuels.
Speaking of the Crewe-based marque, Bentley has pushed back its objective to become EV-only by 2030, delaying it by three years. Similarly, Ford no longer thinks it can go entirely electric in Europe by 2030. Aston Martin recently reversed course as well and will continue to produce cars with combustion engines into the next decade.
It's clear that more and more car companies are reevaluating their EV strategies as people aren't willing to let go of ICE just yet. Automakers are in quite a predicament because emissions regulations are getting tighter, requiring investments to make gas engines run cleaner. At the same time, the electric offensive from China is a cause for concern for global players.

Future Electric Lamborghinis Won't Imitate Combustion Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/722399/future-electric-lamborghini-imitate-combustion-cars/,Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer Rouven Mohr thinks maneuverability is more important than blistering acceleration.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Electric Lamborghinis and more advanced hybrids are coming. Whether that happens sooner rather than later is still uncertain, but the supercar brand isn't planning to simply swap gas for electrons and soldier on like nothing has changed.
That's the takeaway from a recent Top Gear report featuring Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer Rouven Mohr. He speaks at length about character in a future where the sound of an engine and the connection of a manually-shifted gearbox don't exist. To fill the void, he says companies like Lamborghini must be progressive in finding new ways to make people want cars. According to him, bonkers acceleration just isn't enough.
""Character is defined by other things,"" he told Top Gear. ""I think we have some cool ideas. In the next year or two we will showcase our thoughts. It’s far away from what your zero to 62 mph acceleration time is. That is not something that generates fun.""
It's a bold statement considering pretty much everyone looks at acceleration as a key metric for performance. And automakers love to brag about quick times—the faster you go, the more exciting the ride. Electric motors with instant torque are outstanding for delivering gut-punching acceleration, but Mohr suggests straight-line speed without the sound of an engine is an imitation of what's already been done. He envisions a future where the advantages of electric power are used in other ways to generate excitement.
That means handling. And we've already seen some of this in action with other automakers. Mercedes-Benz and Rivian both made headlines with tank turns—spinning electrically driven wheels in opposite directions to rotate the vehicle in place. Torque vectoring is something that's been around for decades, but the instant response of electric motors opens up new possibilities.
Mohr doesn't offer any details on what Lamborghini has cooking. Instead, he suggests the the company's Active Wheel Carrier tech combined with instant power management through electric motors could lead to a new level of maneuverability. Presumably, that doesn't mean a tank-turning Lambo.
Will we see some of this super maneuverability on the Huracan replacement? We'll find out in August when the new hybrid Lambo debuts later this year.

Subaru Explains How Its New Hybrid Boxer Engine is Better,https://www.motor1.com/news/722335/subaru-details-new-hybrid-engine/,Production of the next-gen hybrid powertrain starts this fall.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Some automakers are trying to save the manuals while others are attempting to rescue the internal combustion engine. Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru held a joint conference to explain how decarbonization can be achieved without going all-in on EVs. Toyota has three new smaller and more efficient engines in the works. Mazda is pursuing single- and two-rotor engines. Here's what Subaru is cooking up.
It has figured out how to keep its horizontally opposed engine alive in a next-generation hybrid system. During the conference, the company showed a prototype of its electrified boxer inside a camouflaged Crosstrek prototype. The outgoing setup relies on a parallel system where the engine and motor both power the vehicle. The new series-parallel layout will maintain a mechanical connection between the ICE and the wheels but the combustion engine will also serve as a generator to feed a battery that powers an electric motor.
Next-generation Subaru hybrid boxer engine
Subaru argues the new hardware brings notable benefits not just in terms of fuel economy but also in packaging. The engine, hybrid system, transmission, and transfer case are all housed together while the power control unit is located in the engine bay, without negatively impacting the size of the fuel tank. That allows the engineers to install bigger gas tanks to achieve a longer range.
In the old Crosstrek hybrid, the power control unit was mounted at the rear, so the fuel tank had to be downsized to make room for it. Thanks to the new arrangement, Subaru claims the fuel tank's size will be almost the same in the hybrid as in the regular gas-only model. Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Fujinuki touts a ""very long cruising distance."" During his speech, he said the new system must solve the ""current weakness in fuel efficiency.""
The company's CTO admits that if fuel economy is the ultimate goal, the boxer engine might not represent the ideal solution:
""If you were just going for efficiency, horizontally opposed engines are not necessarily always the best option. But what would Subaru be without them? When you think about it, we are the only mass-market brand making horizontally opposed engines today.""
Toyota also uses a boxer engine but only in the GR86 sports car, which is a sister model of the Subaru BRZ. Porsche has flat-four and flat-six engines but it's far from being a mainstream brand given how much their cars cost.
Subaru plans to start production of its next-gen hybrid boxer engine this fall at a factory in Kitamoto, Saitama at home in Japan. As you can imagine, the hardware is being conceived for all-wheel-drive applications.
Subaru High Performance X Future Concept
In related news, the company is working together with Toyota and Mazda on carbon-neutral fuels. To that end, it'll enter a WRX-based High Performance X Future Concept in the Super Taikyu racing series.
Since we mentioned Mazda earlier, the Zoom-Zoom company is doing things differently with the revival of its rotary. In the MX-30 small crossover, the engine doesn't actually send power to the wheels. Instead, the sole purpose of the transversely mounted rotary is to act as a generator to juice up a battery. An electric motor uses the harvested energy to drive the wheels.
Mazda is already working on a different layout for a longitudinally mounted two-rotor engine that could go into a new sports car, potentially an RX7 reboot it's ""considering.""

BMW Might Make an Electric M3 Wagon,https://www.motor1.com/news/722319/bmw-electric-m3-wagon-report/,But an electric M3 sedan will be out first.,12/25/2024 8:52,"BMW recently gave the M3 Touring a nip and tuck with sharper headlights and slightly more power. Plans are already in motion for a hardcore CS special edition scheduled for 2025 with lots of standard carbon fiber bits and another boost for the engine. Looking further ahead, rumor has it the M division is also cooking up a long-roof M3 without a combustion engine.
A well-known BMW insider familiar with Munich's agenda who has a good track record of getting things right claims an electric M3 Touring is planned. Posting on the Bimmer Post forums, the source alleges a performance electric wagon from Bavaria has been approved for production. Rather than being based on the CLAR platform as the current super estate, it'll be underpinned by the Neue Klasse architecture developed specifically for EVs.
The 2025 BMW M3 Touring with an inline-six engine
It's not coming anytime soon, though. BMW has announced it will launch a Neue Klasse-based 3 Series in 2026, with the electric M3 expected in 2027. Logic tells us the wagon will come after the sedan, so it's unlikely to go on sale before 2028. The same insider mentions the sedan has also been given the green light, along with a next-gen M3 with gas power. Interestingly, there's no word about a like-for-like replacement for the current M3 Touring with a combustion engine.
If you enjoy staying on top with BMW’s internal codenames, the gas M3 is supposedly called the ""G84"" while the electric model is ""ZA0."" The zero-emission M3 Touring is said to be known as the ""ZA1."" According to the same trusted source, the German luxury brand is also plotting fully electric M versions of the Neue Klasse-based X3 and X4. These are apparently referred to as the ""ZA5"" and ""ZA7,"" respectively.
As to what actual names these cars are going to have, BMW has already ruled out combining ""i"" with ""M,"" so don't expect iM3 or something to that effect. Oddly enough, the two letters have already been put together for electric M Performance cars such as the i4 M50, i5 M60, and the i7 M70.
The 2022 BMW Vision Neue Klasse previews the 2026 3 Series electric sedan and its M3 variant
BMW M boss Frank van Meel told Ars Technica a while back that the engineers are working on a dual-motor setup with rear-wheel-drive and a beefier quad-motor layout with all-wheel drive. The M3 models are reportedly getting the former setup, good for roughly 700 horsepower. It should be the same story with the M variants of the electric X3 and X4 since they’ll all be mechanically related.
It's too early to know whether the electric M3 Touring will be sold in the United States where the current performance wagon remains a forbidden fruit. Seeing the glass half full, America is getting the bigger M5 Touring scheduled to debut before the end of this year.

Mate Rimac Designed His Own Nevera and It Looks Rad as Hell,https://www.motor1.com/news/722099/rimac-ceo-designs-custom-nevera/,"He admits he ""wasn't the easiest customer.""",12/25/2024 8:52,"Fifteen years after founding the car company that bears his name, Mate Rimac has designed his own Nevera supercar. He admits he might not have been his company’s easiest customer, but the final creation is stunning.
He decided to show off the car's carbon fiber body in all its glory, as one would hope. The car's bespoke finish has fibers that flow in a very specific direction, continuing across neighboring panels to create an unbroken flow of carbon. However, the body isn't completely devoid of color—Mate tinted the car with red with bare carbon fiber accents. He even requested the bespoke badging feature red anodization.
Mate's Nevera has hand-painted Croatian flags on the side mirrors. It also has a hidden lightning motif under the rear spoiler that represents the sudden, turbulent Mediterranean thunderstorms that helped give the Nevera its name.
Mate selected asymmetrical trim inside—black on one side and red on the other. He filled the cabin with custom, hand-stitched motifs that are visible on the armrests, headrests, and knee pads. One is of Solinjanka, the girl from Solin, based on a sculpture in Zagreb's Archeological Museum.
""It’s kind of a crazy experience to be a customer of your own company,"" Mate says. ""And I probably wasn’t the easiest customer either. Just like with all our customers—there was a process of co-creation; sharing ideas, evolving them, and then finally perfecting them until you have a Nevera that stands alone and speaks to you personally. The result not only looks great but it tells an important story for me.""
Powering the Rimac are four bespoke permanent-magnet, oil-cooled electric motors—one for each wheel. The total output is 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 pound-feet of torque, which can propel the EV to 60 miles per hour in 1.75 seconds. The Nevera's top speed is 258 mph driving forward and 171.34 mph in reverse.

"GM's Novel Axial Flux Motor Could Be  Key to Smaller, Cheaper EVs",https://www.motor1.com/news/722078/gm-axial-flux-motor-patent/,"Using a unique hydraulic system, the automaker could boost the efficiency of an electric motor that is already lightweight and compact.",12/25/2024 8:52,"All BEVs today use radial-flux motors. In a radial-flux motor, a doughnut-shaped wound-copper stator sits around a central rotor often embedded with a series of permanent magnets. They are extremely efficient and well-suited to the task, but they have limitations. Axial flux motors could address many of their shortcomings, and General Motors has a plan to take some of the technology's design advantages even further.
The automaker has published dozens of patents related to the emerging motor topology, but one in particular caught our eye. It describes a system of mechanical field-weakening, which increases the speed of an electric motor at the cost of torque, just like a conventional transmission does.
It could mean smaller, lighter motors with a more useful powerband if it works. The biggest winners would be compact, inexpensive electric vehicles.
Field weakening is typically achieved through complex inverter controls. It creates the ""constant power"" region of an electric motor's output curve. If you didn't know, almost all permanent magnet motors have the same horsepower and torque curve, just at various magnitudes. This is presented in the chart above.
Mechanical field-weakening systems make it much easier to visualize how it works. Here's an example of a radial flux motor utilizing mechanical field weakening. This is an ""outrunner"" style radial flux motor where the rotor sits outside the stator. They're more popular in direct-drive applications.
As the stator is drawn further away from the rotor, the magnetism emanating from the stator gets weaker in relation to the rotor, which means less torque but also higher motor speeds. Just like shifting into second gear, it's a compromise to get the engine—electric in this case—into a different operating region that works better for a particular situation.
Why go mechanical if field-weakening software works with no moving parts? There are losses associated with doing it electronically. In Japan, for instance, people compete against each other in so-called ""Econo Power"" races, and many of the vehicles utilize mechanical field weakening to eke out high efficiency.
Mechanical field-weakening is conceptually simpler to achieve with an axial-flux motor, although there are still serious challenges. Axial flux motors are basically two disks opposed to each other with an air gap between them. When turned on, they spin, sure, but they also try to pull each other together. They're magnets, that's what they do. It'd be weird if they didn't.
The force trying to bring these two plates together at high torque ratings is extreme. This isn't usually a huge problem because you can use a fixed bearing to keep them apart. When you want to do mechanical field weakening, though, the rotor or stator has to move axially to adjust the air gap, but both must also stay totally rigid once they've found a new position.
GM plans to do this using a hydraulic system, which makes sense. It will use hydraulic fluid to narrow the gap when it wants more torque but less speed. It will widen the gap when it wants less torque but more speed.
If this sounds like a lot of cost, complexity, and trouble, consider how good automakers and suppliers have gotten at making something like an automatic transmission. This is much simpler than that, and the implications are impressive.
Smaller, less powerful EVs operating on lower-voltage architectures would be able to get plenty of torque off the line and then widen the air gap to achieve highway speeds. Smaller, lighter motors would be considerably more useful. This chart below from the patent explains it pretty well. The available torque is reduced, but the range at which it can be applied grows.
This system could theoretically operate like a CVT, continuously adjusting the air gap to tailor the motor's characteristics to a variety of situations.
All of this technology sure is interesting, but it likely won't be available for some time. Before we see anything like this, the next generation of mass-market EVs will likely feature more advanced battery technologies and minor enhancements to radial flux motors. Still, when someone like GM is hard at work on axial flux, you have to assume the company sees a future in it.",Peter Holderith
Nissan Has Stopped Spending Money On New Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/721845/nissan-stops-combustion-engine-investments/,It's going all-in on EVs.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru recently announced that they're joining forces to develop next-generation combustion engines. However, another Japanese automaker has taken a radically different approach by deciding to stop investing in gasoline and diesel power altogether. Nissan says it's pretty much done spending cash on new ICE technology.
Australian magazine Drive chatted with the company's Senior Vice-President and Chief Planning Officer for the Africa, Middle East, India, Europe, and Oceania (AMIEO) region about what lies ahead. Francois Bailly was asked whether Nissan intends to develop new combustion engines: ""Our future is EV. We're not investing in new powertrain for ICE, that's for sure.""
He mentioned that the transition from conventional powered cars to fully electric models will be done through Nissan's e-Power technology. It's an unconventional hybrid setup where the combustion engine acts as a generator to charge the battery. It doesn't drive the wheels, so it's similar to Mazda's rotary in the MX-30 crossover and the two-rotor setup in the Iconic SP concept.
To maximize fuel economy in these hybrid cars, Nissan wants to boost the thermal efficiency of a combustion engine to an impressive 50 percent. It's been working on the tech for several years, announcing in early 2021 that a prototype e-Power achieved the milestone during testing. It's worth noting that Toyota's Dynamic Force lineup of three-, four-, and six-cylinder engines has already surpassed 40 percent.
Just because Nissan is no longer pouring money into all-new engines, it doesn't mean the switch to an EV-only lineup will happen overnight. Bailley pointed out that emissions regulations continue to be relaxed in some parts of the world, such as in Africa where Euro 2 cars are still legal. The automaker will align its portfolio to regional requirements, so the ICE's demise will be gradual. Current engines are likely to be updated to meet stricter regulations.
Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru believe the internal combustion engine can be saved by making it run on nearly carbon-neutral fuels. The world's largest car manufacturer is working on three inline-fours while the Zoom-Zoom brand has set up a dedicated rotary team. As for Subie, it's preparing a new hybrid setup based around its signature boxer engine. Honda wants to go purely electric in all main markets (including North America) as early as 2040.

This Hidden Rear Wing Is How Jeep Squeezed 300 Miles Of Range From Its EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/721741/jeep-wagoneer-s-rear-wing-explained/,Jeep’s all-electric Wagoneer S is as aerodynamically slippery as a first-generation Toyota Prius. It's mostly thanks to that wing.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Viewed from the side, the all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S has a silhouette like most two-row luxury SUVs, with a strong resemblance to today’s Grand Cherokee in the greenhouse. Step to the rear, though, and it's a different story: Hidden behind sail-shaped D-pillars, the rear window has a much shallower angle and longer taper than the typical near-vertical tailgate. A giant wing sits atop the D-pillars, creating the illusion of a boxy, upright SUV. It’s a nifty trick that gives the Wagoneer S ultra-slippery aerodynamics while maintaining a more formal shape.
“To hit the aero target, we kept realizing that we had to create a very tapered profile,” Ralph Gilles, Stellantis Chief Design Officer, told Motor1. “We had to taper it to basically a tadpole shape, and none of us liked the look of it. So the wing became a solution to keep the profile attractive and get the benefits of the aero so it doesn't spoil the design.”
As Gilles explained, the typical SUV shape punches a hole in the air, creating a wake of turbulence that drags rearward as the vehicle moves forward. A teardrop or tadpole silhouette helps to close the hole, guiding the air back together and minimizing turbulence. If Jeep wanted the Wagoneer S to maximize its battery range, designers needed to find a way to make it aerodynamically slippery.
The pass-through wing was something of an accidental solution. “Initially it was literally just there to look cool and carry the [rear-view] camera,” Gilles told Motor1. “We ended up twisting it and turning it and finding that we can make it guide the air behind the vehicle, improving the aerodynamics.” The result: A drag coefficient of 0.294, on par with a first-generation Toyota Prius, making the Wagoneer S the slipperiest Jeep ever made.
“The really sloped roofline is absolutely one of the biggest enablers of how we got the 0.294 [Cd],” said Alison Rahm, Vice President of Product Development at Stellantis. “It was a lot of work there to get the roof down and then be able to manage the air as it comes off the roof, which the wing lets us do.”
Engineering the wing was no small feat. “What I tried to do for a long time was to put a center touchdown to the roof, because it hangs so far out, and there's so much mass in it,” Rahm said, noting with a laugh that Gilles was appalled by that idea. “And then you've got the vibration you have to worry about. The digital rearview mirror camera is in the wing. So I had to make sure, as people are staring at the mirror, that it's not oscillating. Finding the right way to get the stability without making it ugly, without adding all this unnecessary weight [...] that was probably one of our greatest challenges.”
Rahm and her team made it work, achieving their aerodynamic goal and enabling the first all-electric Jeep to achieve a battery range claim of more than 300 miles. “It is beautiful,” Rahm said of the cantilevered wing atop the new Jeep. “I stare at the car and I think, thank God, we made it work.”

Ford's Electric Pikes Peak Race Truck Makes Three Whole Tons of Downforce,https://www.motor1.com/news/721735/ford-lightning-supertruck-pikes-peak-downforce/,This is the most ridiculous pickup we've ever seen.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Ford is returning to Pikes Peak later next month with a wild electric pickup. The Blue Oval has been teasing the “EV demonstrator” since March, but today, the automaker gives us a complete look at the truck while revealing it can generate 6,000 pounds of downforce at 150 miles per hour.
The SuperTruck Demonstrator will achieve that figure with its equally wild aerodynamics. The low-slung pickup features a massive goose-neck wing that hangs off the back, towering above the roof of the cab. It also has a wide front splitter, outlets behind the front wheels, and a massive rear diffuser. Ford developed the truck in partnership with STARD.
Ford didn’t provide any further details about its electric SuperTruck beyond how much downforce it’ll make. However, it does have some styling similarities to the SuperVan 4.2 that the automaker campaigned in last year’s hillclimb event.
That, too, had a massive wing and an aggressive aero kit that kept it planted through the course’s 156 turns. Its triple-motor setup produced 1,400 horsepower. The new pickup could have a similar setup, but we’ll have to wait for more details. The Ford SuperVan 4.0 had four motors that made 1,972 hp.
This is Ford’s second electric demonstrator. It released the F-150 Switchgear, built in collaboration with RTR, earlier this year. The company based it on the production Lightning platform, enhancing its off-road capability with skid plats, composite body panels, and a new suspension.
Ford will likely continue teasing the pickup leading up to the event’s 102nd running that begins on June 23. We'll likely learn more details between now and when it runs up the hill. Romain Dumas, the current Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record holder, will pilot the Ford. But the Blue Oval won’t be the only automaker there with an EV. A modified Hyundai Ioniq 5 will also tackle the famous hillclimb course later in June.

"Fiat Reverses Course, Puts Gas Engine Back Into 500",https://www.motor1.com/news/721323/fiat-500-gas-engine-2026/,The latest 500 is purely electric but Fiat will install a combustion engine from 2026.,12/25/2024 8:52,"The rumors were true. Fiat has confirmed the latest 500 will get a combustion engine after all. Despite being launched strictly as an electric city car with no word of an ICE variant, the hatchback will get gasoline power. Parent company Stellantis has announced a hybrid 500 will be made at the Mirafiori factory in Italy beginning in 2026.
To be fair, the 500 technically never lost its combustion engine; Fiat still sells the previous-generation model outside the United States as a hybrid. In North America, the pint-sized car is strictly electric. It's too soon to say whether the ICE model will make its way to the US where it would definitely be cheaper than the pricey EV. The 2024 500e costs $34,095 before options.
It's obvious that the EV market's cooldown is forcing automakers to alter plans. Many assumed electric vehicles would replace ICE models sooner or later, but with EV incentives being gradually reduced and even eliminated in some cases, people are reconsidering their options.
With the new 500 getting a gas engine, it'll be interesting to see whether the high-performance Abarth 500e will also be joined by a hybrid model. As with the Fiat-badged, previous-generation model, Abarth still sells the sporty 500 with a conventional engine.
Several years ago, Fiat announced it would go purely electric by the end of the decade. However, it's unclear whether that's still happening. Other brands have also pushed back their EV-only ambitions beyond 2030, with the most recent example being Ford of Europe.
In related news, Stellantis also intends to build a hybrid version of the Jeep Compass at the Melfi plant in Italy. No further details were released but we're hoping it'll be based on the third-generation model. The current crossover has been around since 2016, so it's getting a bit long in the tooth.
Speaking of old cars sticking around, the Italian automaker isn't ruling out selling the Panda until 2029, at which point it will have been 18 years old. It would peacefully coexist with the next-gen model slated to debut on July 11 to mark 125 years of Fiat.

How Kia Quietly Designs Some of the Best-Looking Cars on the Road,https://www.motor1.com/features/720607/kia-design-interview/,"Kia's new head of design, Karim Habib, is turning the brand into a subtle stylistic powerhouse.",12/25/2024 8:52,"The Duomo di Milano cathedral in Italy took six centuries to erect. Six. Hundred. Years. Now it stands tall as the third-largest church on the planet and one of the prettiest buildings to grace God's green Earth. It better be for that much work.
Designing a car isn't the same as sculpting a religious landmark, but it's still a time-consuming process. Senior Vice President and Head of Kia Design, Karim Habib, knows that all too well. Habib has had a long career in car design. He spent years with BMW and Mercedes-Benz and had a small stint at Infiniti before heading Kia.
He's the man partly responsible for Kia's controversial new logo. Soon, his unique eye for design will have shaped every car that rolls off Kia's factory floor. You know his previous works like the Carnival, K5, and the facelifted Sorento. But Kia's embrace of electrification excites Habib the most from a design standpoint.
""To me, as a designer, the wonderful thing about EVs for design is you have to have big wheels because the cars are heavier,"" he tells me. ""You have to have a long wheelbase because you need as much battery as possible between the wheels. And you have short overhangs because you don’t have an engine in front of the front axle. So when you start with that, those are the basic ingredients that only premium manufacturers could afford in the past.""
Karim and I are sitting and chatting on a couch just a few miles from the heart of Milan, Italy near the Duomo. It's Design Week, an event that Kia—and Karim—deem hugely important for Kia design. With an event so focused on style, it’s the best way to get savvy shoppers in front of the newest product.
It's here where Kia offers us a closer look at the upcoming EV3—a tiny subcompact EV no bigger than the current Seltos. We saw the first EV3 concept in October, but this one is nearly production-ready; Kia says it's about as close as you can get to production while still being able to call it a prototype. The interior still isn't finished. Visually it looks similar to the updated EV6, and closer still to the newest EV9. Only tinier.
Best of all, the EV3 is coming to the US.
The EV3 offers a unique take on Kia’s ""Opposites United"" design language, which Karim helped pen nearly five years ago. While other automakers—like their corporate cousins at Hyundai—shy away from familial designs spanning multiple models, Karim believes that brand recognition is hugely important for Kia moving forward. He wants you to be able to point out his cars in a crowded parking lot and recognize them as Kias.
""Continuity is important. We’re a smaller brand than Hyundai, so it’s important for us to be recognized for a certain set of values and experiences they get when they come to Kia,"" he explains. ""So the product palette will change that perception, but we still want to have a common denominator that is the foundation. And obviously, the design is there to illustrate the values of the brand—you represent the brand as an object. So that’s why that consistency is important to us.""
The EV3 is the freshest take on Kia’s design language yet. Slim, upright LED lighting elements afford the SUV a clean, modern look while the boxy shape (becoming all too common in car design) arguably works even better on the smaller SUV than it does on, say, the three-row EV9.
The same can be said of the cabin. Clean, simple lines surround two 12.3-inch displays and a few hard buttons (like a volume dial, bless), flanked by eco-friendly materials like wool and faux leather. Kia has done away with leather in all of its EVs, in fact, and the company is looking into other eco-friendly materials. Mushroom leather, for example.
""Continuity is important... It’s important for us to be recognized for a certain set of values and experiences they get when they come to Kia.""
Karim uses terms like ""strictness"" and ""authenticity"" when describing the EV3. And while the pint-sized EV isn’t rugged at all, he does reference ionic off-roaders like Land Cruisers, Land Rovers, and Jeeps as inspiration. The idea, Karim says, is to make sure Kia’s EV designs remain as relevant as those historic SUVs still do today.
SUVs are a huge focus for Kia, obviously. The company sells a ton of them. The EV6 was the first toe dipped into electrification, and the EV9—even in its infancy—is proving to be a huge success. Soon the EV3 will stand alone as one of the only affordable electric SUVs in America as Kia aims for a starting price of around $30,000.
But Kia still cares about performance.
Remember the EV4 sedan concept from October? That too is heading to production (potentially alongside the EV3) and Karim wants to keep the brand’s ""Opposites United"" design language consistent there, too. But with more of an emphasis on performance.
""With the EV4 concept, we also have [those design elements]. When you have horizontal headlamps at the corner, it automatically makes the car feel wider,"" he explains. ""So having these vertical headlamps is a bit of a challenge, we weren’t sure if it would make the car feel narrower or higher. But we managed to place them pretty low so that you still get a nice dynamic quality to it. It has some challenges that come with it, but I think we can find ways to make it work.""
The Kia EV4 could become the next Stinger—or a slightly smaller sports sedan akin to the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 Performance. Either way, it will bear a version of Kia’s edgy design language found on the EV3 and EV9. Though, it certainly won’t be a cut-and-paste job, either.
""The [design] principle, I hope, is based on the same idea, but the execution should be different,"" says Karim.
As with anything, good design takes time. Karim and Kia both believe that. And amidst a design renaissance that could propel the company into the next decade and hopefully well beyond, Kia has no plans of rushing its future.

Volkswagen And Renault Won't Build An Affordable EV Together,https://www.motor1.com/news/720684/renault-volkswagen-failed-ev-collaboration/,"The Twingo is still happening, just not with VW's help.",12/25/2024 8:52,"Facing an influx of cheap electric cars from China, European automakers have legitimate reasons to worry. Renault wanted to create an alliance with Volkswagen to better compete with imports but to no avail. A jointly developed EV with a low starting price is not happening. Speaking with Reuters, Renault CEO Luca de Meo said the talks between the two parties have ended.
The French company's head honcho calls it a ""lost opportunity,"" but he suggests that Renault is still open to collaborating with other car manufacturers: ""There may be others."" VW refused to comment, but the two major automakers have officially parted ways. Meanwhile, Renault is riding solo and still aims to have the next-gen Twingo on sale in 2026.
It's worth noting the old Twingo is still around, both with combustion engines and as an EV. The all-new city car will come exclusively in zero-emission guise and undercut the Renault 5, which is kicking off from about €25,000 ($27,000) before incentives. The new Twingo is projected to cost less than €20,000 ($21,600).
It's unclear what VW plans now that it's no longer negotiating with Renault. The Wolfsburg company could use an entry-level EV that would undercut the ID.3 and act as a replacement for the e-up! Something along the lines of an ID.1. VW technical development boss Kai Grunitz has already suggested it would be priced at under €20,000 ($21,600). He projected it would go on sale around 2027.
The battle in the entry-level EV segment is heating up, not just because of Chinese cars flooding Europe. The Dacia Spring is a roaring success, albeit that one too is technically a Chinese car. A better example is the Citroën e-C3, which costs €23,300 and is getting a base version with a lower driving range for €19,990.
In the United States, automakers largely focus on crossovers for their EV ambitions. There's the Fiat 500e and Nissan Leaf on the affordable non-SUV side, with a new Chevrolet Bolt coming next year. The new electric Mini 3-Door could also come to America as well later this decade, but only after production starts in Oxford in 2026.

The Jeep Avenger 4xe Gets Four-Wheel Drive and Lifted Suspension,https://www.motor1.com/news/720543/jeep-avenger-4xe-debut-specs/,The Jeep you can't have in the US finally has what all Jeeps should: Four-wheel drive.,12/25/2024 8:52,"It's strange to talk about a Jeep model not sold in the United States. The Avenger, a small Euro-only crossover revealed in 2022, is built at the Tychy plant in Poland alongside its sister models, the Alfa Romeo Junior and Fiat 600. It’s only been offered with front-wheel drive, but now, a new 4xe hybrid trim adds what all Jeeps should have: four-wheel drive.
At the heart of the Avenger 4xe is a tiny 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with mild-hybrid technology. It's a three-cylinder turbo mill that develops 136 horsepower and routes output to the wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Joining the ICE are two electric motors, one at the front and the other at the rear, with each developing 28 hp.
Jeep claims the new hybrid setup enables a sprint to 62 mph in nine and a half seconds and a top speed of 121 mph. At speeds of up to 19 mph, the Avenger 4xe always works in 4x4 mode with a 50:50 split between the two axles. From 19 to 56 mph, it defaults to front-wheel drive, but the rear motor is always ready to intervene should the need arise since. Go faster than 56 mph and the rear motor is disengaged to reduce fuel consumption.
The 4xe brings other benefits. The hybrid trim also gets a multi-link rear suspension and jacks up the ride height for an extra 0.4 inches of ground clearance, now at 8.26 inches. The 22-degree approach, 35-degree departure, and 21-degree breakover angles are better than those of a regular Avenger with front-wheel drive.
Jeep says the more capable variant can ford water up to about 15.75 inches deep. To sweeten the pot, there are Snow, Sand & Mud, Sport, and Auto driving modes to choose from. On top of that, customers can spend extra on the optional all-terrain tires better suited for tackling rough terrain.
Jeep has toughened up the Avenger's appearance by giving the 4xe rugged bumpers with a scratch-resistant finish. Roof rails come as standard, as does a rear tow hitch. Inside, the seats are upholstered in a waterproof material claimed to be twice as durable as before. The seats also have a special coating making it easier to remove stains and mud.
The not-for-America Jeep Avenger 4xe goes on sale in Europe late this year. It joins the already available mild-hybrid and purely electric derivatives that are both offered strictly with a front-wheel-drive setup.

Another Rumor Says Hyundai's Hydrogen Supercar Debuts in 2026 With 765 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/720509/hyundai-hydrogen-supercar-2026-launch/,It'll try to claim the Nurburgring record for production cars.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Ok, here we go again. The N Vision 74 refuses to die. Multiple reports suggest Hyundai plans to put its modern take on the DeLorean into production, and the gossip keeps piling up. South Korean business newspaper The Korea Economic Daily says the hydrogen supercar is happening. For real this time. It's supposedly coming out in 2026, four years after the concept car debuted.
The Hyundai flagship sports car is apparently known internally as the ""N74"" and is being developed with a rear-wheel-drive layout. The street-legal model is said to be a two-door coupe with gullwing doors and design cues from the 1974 Pony Coupe—the brand's very first car.
While the concept had to make do with ""just"" 671 horsepower, the subsequent production model will allegedly pack at least 765 horsepower. The Korea Economic Daily—which is the country's largest business newspaper by revenue, per Wikipedia—claims the N74 will be able to hit 62 mph in three seconds flat.
The N74 will reportedly go after the Nurburgring record for production cars, which won't be easy considering the Mercedes-AMG One did a lap of the Green Hell in only 6 minutes and 35.183 seconds. The report goes on to mention that Hyundai's dedicated supercar will do two laps of the Nordschleife at full tilt before running out of juice.
Hyundai will reportedly limit production to only 200 units and build these cars from 2026 until 2028. Prototype testing is apparently slated to start as early as this August. The N74 is said to cost an estimated 500 million won, which works out to about $366,000 at current exchange rates.
The idea behind the car is not necessarily to make a profit but to prove hydrogen can be an exciting technology. It remains to be seen how many people will be willing to fork out this kind of money for a Hyundai. With the Ioniq 5 N, the company has already proven battery-powered EVs can be exciting. Provided the report is accurate, the firm now wants to replicate that with a hydrogen fuel cell performance vehicle.
As always, we take the information with the proverbial pinch of salt. An N74 would be an interesting alternative to the current crop of ICE, plug-in hybrid, and EV supercars. Not just because of its unusual powertrain but also thanks to its excellent design.

Alpine Wants To Sell A Hydrogen V-6 Road Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/720348/alpine-v6-road-car-considered/,It would have over 340 horsepower.,12/25/2024 8:52,"With Alpine coming to the United States in 2026, we're keeping a close eye on what Renault's performance division is planning. Like so many other brands, the French marque is investing in fully electric vehicles, but the combustion engine could still play a role. The ICE could be saved by making it run on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels.
Alpine's design boss Antony Villain told Autocar the Alpenglow isn't just for show since it was developed with a production car in mind. While the concept features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a bigger V-6 is already in development. It's going to have more than the 340 horsepower offered by the four-pot. The larger internal combustion engine might find its way into a street-legal model that would be sold in a limited series.
When asked whether the Alpenglow has a shot of making it to production, Villain replied: ""Why not? Why not have that on the roads? We want to keep both ways [hydrogen ICE and EV] possible. Maybe we could do a little series of these cars for the road. That could be just right."" Alpenglow is an evolution of a namesake concept from 2022 and Renault's go-faster division is already planning a third variant that'll look closer to a production vehicle.
The sports car's current iteration is off to a rocky start since it failed to take part during its maiden test in Belgium at the Spa-Francorchamps track. It wasn't the combustion engine's fault, but rather an electrical issue. As it stands, Alpenglow uses an LMP3 chassis from Ligier, replacing the original concept’s bespoke chassis. The smaller engine will be swapped out later this year for the new V-6.
Speaking during the Annual General Meeting last week, Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo hinted at putting the Alpenglow into production. He said the A110 is not going to be on sale for much longer but the lineup will be renewed and expanded to seven models. The portfolio will be ""100-percent electric and maybe, potentially, hydrogen-engine cars.""
In the meantime, it’s sadly too late for the mid-engine A110 to come to the United States. Its electric replacement is due here in 2026 as a coupe and roadster, with an SUV arriving in 2027 and a four-door A310 swoopy sedan to follow a year later.

Lamborghini Uncertain Electric Supercars Will Ever Catch On,https://www.motor1.com/news/720360/lamborghini-uncertain-electric-supercars-popular/,Winkelmann sees an opportunity with combustion engines running on e-fuels.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Lamborghini’s first EV won't arrive until 2028—and it's not going to be a supercar. Instead, Lanzador will take the shape of a lifted 2+2 grand tourer with four seats. Something like a Huracan or Revuelto EV isn't on the agenda. Why? There's just no business case. The company's CEO believes electric supercars are selling poorly.
Speaking with Automotive News Europe, Lamborghini's head honcho Stephan Winkelmann argued electric supercars are ""not something that is selling so far."" He went on to mention this genre might never catch on: ""It's too early, and we have to see down the road if and when this is going to happen.""
It makes sense that Lamborghini still uses a V-12 in the Aventador's replacement while the Huracan successor will have gas power as well. However, the smaller of the two supercars is losing its naturally aspirated V-10 in favor of a newly developed twin-turbo V-8.
Supercars are for rich folk but Rimac CEO Mate Rimac recently admitted that high-end buyers don't want electric supercars. It's why the Nevera is still for sale, despite the hype around it and the limited production run of only 150 cars. The electric hypercar developed in Croatia set no fewer than 23 records last year, but it looks as though wealthy people weren't impressed enough to sign their names on the dotted line.
Bugatti is also keeping the internal combustion engine alive with its upcoming Chiron replacement. The Molsheim-based brand isn't even cutting the cylinder count. The new ""French"" beast will have a naturally aspirated V-16 engine as part of a hybrid setup.
Another elite brand currently staying away from full EVs is Pagani, despite working on the technology since 2018. It hasn't abandoned the R&D efforts but a production model is not coming anytime soon. Why? Batteries are still too heavy and that dilutes the driving experience.
However, not all supercar brands think this way. Ferrari is still on track to introduce a performance EV. It’s actually ahead of schedule with development, before launching the car in late 2025. Meanwhile, it's opening a new factory in Maranello next month. The site will build the company's electric models.
Stricter emissions regulations are forcing automakers to transition to EVs but supercar makers are sticking with gas engines for as long as possible. Why? Because they know what their customers want, which is the emotion only a large-displacement ICE can deliver. EVs are significantly quicker but Stephan Winkelmann reckons it's not as thrilling as a high-revving gas engine mounted behind the seats.
Ideally, the Lamborghini supremo wants to save combustion engines by switching to e-fuels. The Italian exotic brand could leverage the advancements made by the Volkswagen Group brand Porsche in developing and producing nearly carbon-neutral synthetic fuels in Chile.

Honda Modified A Peterbilt To Run On Hydrogen Fuel Cells,https://www.motor1.com/news/719966/honda-modified-peterbilt-hydrogen-fuel-cells/,It uses three fuel cell systems generating a total output of 240 kilowatts and can go 400 miles with a full load.,12/25/2024 8:52,"Honda is known for its small vehicles. But there's nothing small about the company's latest concept. It's a semi-truck infused with hydrogen fuel cells, simply dubbed the Class 8 Hydrogen Fuel Cell Truck Concept. Honda will showcase it, along with other fuel-cell vehicles, at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Las Vegas on May 20.
The truck is a fully functional demonstrator designed to showcase Honda's current hydrogen tech. It carries three fuel-cell systems, each capable of generating 80 kilowatts. That's 240 kW of combined energy, powering an unknown number of electric motors. Honda says the truck has an estimated top speed of 70 mph, and can travel 400 miles before refueling. It's worth noting the range applies to a fully loaded truck/trailer combo weighing 82,000 pounds.
While the truck is a concept, the fuel cells aren't. They're new mass-production items currently being built at the joint Honda-General Motors plant in Michigan. With this truck, Honda hopes to grab the interests of potential partners to help pursue a hydrogen-fueled future.
“Commercial vehicles, including Class 8 trucks, where fuel cells offer the best zero-emission replacement for existing diesel applications, are a key part of Honda’s broad hydrogen business strategy,” said Ryan Harty, Honda assistant vice president of sustainability and business development. “Honda is actively seeking business collaborations and customers to help bring these hydrogen fuel cell solutions to market here in North America.”
Honda takes ownership of the concept with its fuel cell internals, but the truck is actually a Peterbilt. To our eye, it looks like a 579EV—a battery electric rig with a pair of e-axles and a range of 150 miles. Honda makes no mention of Peterbilt in its announcement, and images show Peterbilt badges removed from the concept. It's unclear if there's any co-development happening between the two brands; we contacted Honda for clarification, and we'll provide an update if more information becomes available.

The 2025 Kia Sorento Plug-In Hybrid Is Cheaper Than Last Year's Model,https://www.motor1.com/news/719672/2025-kia-sorento-plug-in-hybrid-price/,"The base price is now $49,365 thanks to a new entry-level trim. Step up to the SX Prestige model and you'll be paying $54,465.",12/25/2024 8:52,"Kia announced pricing and information for 2025 Sorento Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid on Tuesday, both of which get the refresh we've already seen for the pure combustion 2024 model. As you might expect, prices are higher versus last year—significantly higher in some cases. But there's a surprise in the mix. The new Sorento plug-in hybrid's base price is actually lower than before.
That's because buyers now have a new entry-level trim to choose from. EX is now the entry point for the plug-in hybrid, with a base price of $49,365, including a $1,375 destination charge. That's $2,300 less than last year's base MSRP, and you still get the same hybrid powertrain making 261 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. As a refresher, it's a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with a single electric motor and a 14-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The 2025 Sorento's electric-only range is 30 miles.
The EX trim also gets luxuries like heated power front seats, a 12.3-inch center display, 19-inch aluminum wheels, LED headlights, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and gobs of USB power ports throughout the three-row interior. Over-the-air updates are standard, as are a modest selection of driver-assist features like lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot warning, and forward collision avoidance, and more. And it's all wrapped in the facelifted exterior that Kia revealed last year.
Stepping up to the SX Prestige trim costs $54,465—$2,800 more than last year. This is where you'll find stuff like leather trim, heated and ventilated seats, a Bose stereo system, dual 12.3-inch screens for the driver and the center infotainment system, and more. It's also the only way to get Kia's full suite of driver assists like blind-spot collision avoidance, advanced frontal collision avoidance, rear collision avoidance, and a surround-view camera.
Kia also announced pricing and details for the mild-hybrid Sorento. You'll pay $40,065 for the entry-level EX with front-wheel drive; going for all-wheel drive bumps the sticker to $41,865. These are modest increases of $1,700 and $1,200 versus last year. The Sorento Hybrid SX Prestige, meanwhile, takes a $4,400 leap to start at $48,265. The 227-horsepower hybrid powertrain carries over from 2024; it's a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with a single motor powered by a 1.5 kilowatt-hour battery.

"Jaguar's New Electric GT Will Start At Over $125,000",https://www.motor1.com/news/719485/jaguar-electric-gt-starting-price/,A concept previewing the new model debuts in the US later this year.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Last year Jaguar Land Rover announced an expensive rebranding. The company shortened its corporate name to JLR, turned its Land Rover models into individual brands, and teased Jaguar's electrified future. The company's $18.6-billion investment will include an effort to take Jaguar upmarket, which will put the price of its first electric vehicle at over £100,000 ($125,000 at today's exchange rate).
We'll get our first look at what $125k will get you later this year when Jaguar reveals a concept that previews the new GT. The British carmaker will launch the car at an event somewhere in the United States, a market it says is vital to the company's success. The hope is to put Jaguar in competition with brands like Bentley and Porsche.
Jaguar's three new electric vehicles will ride on the Jaguar Electrified Platform. JLR CEO Adrian Mardell said the architecture, which is special to the brand, would allow Jaguer to feel unique once again, according to Automotive News Europe.
This isn't the first time the company has sought premium buyers, as Mardell noted that Jaguar had previously been successful at such an effort in the 1990s.
Personally, we're hoping for an XJ220 revival. Jaguar Chief Creative Officer Gerry McGovern said during last week's company investors call that limited-run special editions will be vital to the brand's relaunch and pricing strategy. The new, four-door GT will be an all-new model for the brand that’ll take inspiration from past vehicles like the iconic E-Type. It goes on sale sometime in 2025.

The First Hybrid Porsche 911 Debuts on May 28,https://www.motor1.com/news/719326/porsche-911-hybrid-debut-may-28/,"It's 8.7 seconds quicker on the Nurburgring than its predecessor, the Carrera S",12/25/2024 8:53,"A completely new era for the Porsche 911 will begin on May 28. Porsche plans to reveal the first road-going 911 hybrid, pushing the iconic sports car into the modern era.
We've seen the 911 hybrid in prototype form for over two years now. Porsche tells us that development is now complete, amassing 3.1 million miles in the process. Some of that mileage comes from the Nürburgring, where Porsche shares a rather tantalizing clue as to what badge the electrified 911 will wear. We're told the hybrid laps the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 16.9 seconds, 8.7 seconds faster than ""the corresponding version of the predecessor model.""
Basic math brings us to 7:25.6, and a quick look through recent Porsche 911 Nurburgring lap times brings us to the 992-generation Carrera S, which turned a 7:25 lap back in 2020. Images shared from Porsche don't reveal badges, but the lack of bonkers bodywork points to something on the milder side. A Carrera S with a hybrid powertrain certainly fits that bill.
“For the first time in our icon’s 61-year history, we are installing a hybrid drive system in a roadgoing 911,"" said Frank Moser, Porsche vice president for the 911 and 718. ""This innovative performance hybrid makes the 911 even more dynamic. We left nothing to chance during development and tested the new 911 under all sorts of conditions all over the world from the freezing cold to scorching heat, as was the case during the final stages of testing in Dubai.""
Details of the hybrid powertrain are as yet unknown. Porsche tells us it's aimed at performance, not efficiency, and we were previously told it won't be a plug-in hybrid. With a 'Ring time of 7:16, is should be plenty fast without losing its capability to carve corners.
All will be revealed on May 28. Be sure to check back in 18 days time, we'll have everything you need to know.

The BMW 7 Series Plug-In Hybrid Can't Beat The EV,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/719302/bmw-7-series-plug-in-hybrid-review/,"BMW's newest 7 Series is a fantastic car, but the plug-in hybrid drivetrain isn’t up to snuff.",12/25/2024 8:53,"I pay attention to how others perceive the car I’m in, whether it’s my own bargain-basement poverty-spec Camry, or a supercar. So I can assure you that the BMW 7 Series stands alone as the most fearsome vehicle I’ve ever tested. Finished in ""Frozen Pure Gray"" with all-black M accents, this car—a plug-in hybrid 750e xDrive—is downright evil. Cyclists yield. Pedestrians shuffle through crosswalks faster. Minivans leave the fast lane.

The 7 Series' dramatic proportions are unmatched by its contemporaries. With present-day upper crusters obsessed with projecting their ethical consumerism, a sedan that looks like Cruella De Ville’s daily driver stands alone. Whether you find it attractive or not, the 750e means business, and for that, I love it.
It looks a bit less like a supervillain’s lair inside, but remains just as luxurious as one. My demo car ($135,345 as-tested) had nicer carpets than I have in my apartment, and the wine-colored, full-grain Merino leather appointments are Rolls-quality. (If Merino leather is too poverty-spec, don’t worry, cashmere upholstery is also an option.)
The 18-way adjustable front power seats are some of the most comfortable I’ve ever experienced, and the fit and finish in the cabin is some of the best I’ve ever seen. One-touch automatic doors slam themselves shut with a satisfying “thunk”. The optional 1,965-watt Bowers & Wilkins speaker system ($4,800) has beautifully crafted grilles integrated into the door cards, and audio quality is sublime. The LED-woven glass roof ($950) is stunning at night and perfectly tinted during the day. The armrests are heated. No detail was lazily developed; Even the seats get a set of opulent crystal levers on the LED-backlit door panel strip for adjustment, with fine movements controlled via the center touchscreen.
That 14.3-inch touchscreen is also where you access the 7 Series Executive Package’s ($4,600) seat massage functionality… as well as basically every other piece of functionality in the car. The driver gets a heavily customizable 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that seamlessly blends into the infotainment system; Both of these screens are housed in the same curved glass panel that spans two-thirds of the dash. BMW’s iDrive infotainment software runs on the “floating” display, and it’s beautiful, responsive, and fairly easy to navigate, although some of the menus are hidden.
There are some minor frustrations stemming from the UI’s singular focus on the touchscreen—both driver and passenger cannot adjust their seat heaters at the same time, as only one set of controls can be used at once, for example. For a cabin almost wholly devoid of buttons, the 7 Series’ overall user experience is still excellent.
Less satisfying is the driver’s heads-up display, which takes up enough windshield real estate to become distracting. The HUD—combined with the odd half-click, half-scroll wheels on either side of the steering wheel—were confusing and difficult to use on the fly. I often changed radio stations accidentally, and had to shift my focus to the HUD to fix whatever I’d just bumped.
These quibbles pale in comparison to actually driving the 750e, which stands alone in the 7-Series lineup… as by far the most frustrating of any drivetrain on offer.
Like the mild-hybrid and fully electric 7 Series variants, the 750e has lithe, if numb, handling for its 126.6-inch wheelbase, thanks to well-tuned four-wheel steering. The problem with this PHEV is the integration of its 194-horsepower single electric motor and 308-hp turbocharged straight-six drivetrains.
Apply mild pressure to the brake pedal and regenerative braking is smooth, but weak. Then the car lurches, decelerating much harder, once the pedal is pressed hard enough to engage the calipers. The 750e’s pedal travel inconsistencies make smoothly stopping very difficult. What’s worse, the amount of brake pressure it takes to engage the calipers is variable based on speed, so I never quite knew what the pedal would feel like at any given stoplight.
BMW’s insistence of always-on “adaptive braking”—where the 750e slows itself down for stop signs or traffic ahead—drove me completely insane. It was always different behavior from the brakes every single day. The only way to shut off this one-and-a-half pedal driving was to engage Sport Mode, which brought me to my next major frustration: the throttle pedal.
At low speeds in normal modes, the EV drivetrain is quick and responsive, but lean into the pedal harder and it becomes difficult to modulate. The throttle feels as though it has two-thirds the travel it should, and attempting to smoothly roll on the gas for a quick getaway often results in pushing past the electric-only drivetrain and into a surge of gas-powered fury. Switching to Sport Mode (to get better brake behavior) made the entire driveline twitchier. When wrung out in anger, the 750e moves in a hurry (4.6 seconds to 60) thanks to its hybrid system’s 493 hp. But driving the 7 Series in constant anger feels like defeating its entire purpose.
The least frustrating way to drive the 750e was to get to the freeway, turn on the Level 2 Highway Driving Assistant ($2,000), and let the Bimmer do the heavy lifting. Still, I would have preferred more of me driving the Ultimate Driving Machine.
The EPA rates the 14.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack for 34 miles of all-electric range, which is middling in the class—the Mercedes S-Class PHEV achieves 56 miles of EV-only driving. The EPA estimates the 750e can achieve 65 MPGe (and 25 MPG) overall; I ran the 7-Series’s battery to zero and still achieved more than 30 MPG total, which is great for the 5,635-pound 750e.
The efficiency still isn’t worth the frustration. Luckily, if you want to skip all of the annoyance of the 750e but still enjoy the 7 Series’ incredible cabin and styling, you can. The superb, all-electric i7 is on offer for $1,000 less, with all of the same strengths and a much more solid drivetrain. Skip the plug-in, and move straight to the EV.

Two Hyundai Ioniq 5 Ns Overtake Dozens Of Cars At Nürburgring,https://www.motor1.com/news/719388/hyundai-ioniq-5-nurburgring-laps/,The hot EVs perform intense back-to-back laps of the Nordschleife.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Whoever thought the day would come when we'd be talking about an exciting Hyundai electric crossover? The Ioniq 5 N is just that, and these hot laps of the Nurburgring show it’s a real track weapon despite its heft. It may weigh close to 4,900 pounds but the hot EV is properly fast, provided it’s in the hands of a skilled driver, as is the case here.
Nordschleife ""resident"" Misha Charoudin took the high-performance electric crossover for a full lap of the challenging track, overtaking dozens of cars in the process. The intense onboard footage shows the YouTuber chasing another Ioniq 5 N. The two cars did back-to-back laps, switching positions during the second run.
The 84.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack was fully charged before hitting the track. Despite being pushed hard, the Ioniq 5 N still had 42 percent of juice left at the end of the second lap. As a refresher, the Nürburgring is one of the longest circuits in the world, at nearly 13 miles long. The two runs weren't timed but Sport Auto's test driver Christian Gebhardt did a 7:45 lap a few months ago. That made it only 2.6 seconds slower than a BMW M2 CS.
To be fair, not all drivers on the track were as experienced as Misha. Knowing a circuit like that gives you the confidence to push the car further. However, even if we were as experienced as him, we'd be reluctant to punish the Ioniq 5 N while the owner sits on the passenger seat.
The exciting track footage goes to show the era of truly exciting EVs is upon us. We could honestly do without the fake engine noise and gear changes, though. The recipe should be further improved if Hyundai decides to come out with a smaller and lighter vehicle. A dedicated sports car with the dual-motor setup and all the other N trickery would be wonderful.
In the meantime, the Korean brand is gearing up to launch an Ioniq 6 N sedan that could have even more power. You know, because 641 hp is apparently not enough.

This Alpine Sports Car Has a Hydrogen Combustion Turbo Engine,https://www.motor1.com/news/719186/alpine-alpenglow-hy4-details/,It's only a four-pot but a bigger V-6 is coming.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Some automakers are adamant that the combustion engine is worth saving. Toyota believes it can be done by making the ICE burn hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. Porsche and Lamborghini think synthetic fuels might be the answer. Renault's performance brand Alpine is on team hydrogen, and this Alpenglow Hy4 is a proof of concept.
An evolution of the static 2022 Alpenglow concept, the Hy4 is a running prototype. It rocks a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine developing 340 horsepower. The four-cylinder mill revs to 7,000 rpm and feeds off from three hydrogen tanks, each carrying 4.6 pounds of hydrogen at 700 bar of pressure. Output is channeled to the road via a sequential transmission.
If you finding the four-pot underwhelming, Alpine is working on a bigger engine. An all-new V-6 developed entirely in-house specifically for hydrogen applications is coming. A subsequent variant of the Alpenglow, possibly called the Hy6, will premiere in late 2024. In the meantime, the Hy4 is about to hit the track.
It'll make its public debut tomorrow during the six-hour endurance race at Spa-Francorchamps as part of the FIA WEC 2024 season. It will then head to France to attend the 24 Hours of Le Mans scheduled for June 14-15.
The Hy4 is not a spitting image of the original Alpenglow concept since Alpine tweaked the body. It has a modified crash structure to accommodate a two-seat cabin while the hydrogen tanks are embedded into the side pods. It's also a bit taller than before and has a reworked aero package, accentuated by the new roof scoop.
While the Hy4 is a track-only machine, Alpine believes the powertrain technology makes sense in a street-legal model as well. The French niche marque goes as far as to say a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine represents a ""tremendously promising solution for road use.""
The idea of modifying a combustion engine to run on hydrogen is much older than Toyota's experiments with the GR Yaris and GR Corolla. BMW had a V-12 7 Series with a 6.0-liter unit running on hydrogen in 2005. Going even further back in time, the German luxury brand developed a 5 Series (E12) to run on liquid hydrogen in the late 1970s. It's the 520h featured below in a BMW Group Classic video.

The Hummer EV SUV Is Not for the Rational,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/718986/hummer-ev-suv-in-moab/,"The Hummer EV can do a lot off-road for a 9,000-ish pound truck, but its strengths lie beyond ability or rationality.",12/25/2024 8:53,"It is absurd that GMC only offers one shocking color for the Hummer EV: Afterburner Tintcoat, an eye-searing tangerine. Ordering GMC’s self-proclaimed “supertruck” in rental-car silver would be akin to whitewashing Saint Basil’s Cathedral. This design is at its best when screaming for attention. Obviously, when faced with a lineup of Hummers to test, I asked for the bright orange one, cranked up some ‘80s rock, and made sure all eyes would be on me.
It’s a good thing I started there, because grabbing attention turned out to be the Hummer’s greatest strength—on pavement, at least. GMC tossed me the keys in Grand Junction, Colorado, and told me to get to Moab, Utah an hour and a half away.
As you might expect of a bright orange T-topped SUV, it's not oozing practicality. The Hummer was “please speak up” noisy at highway speed, courtesy of enormous all-terrain tires and a flat windshield. Steering feel is numb and heavy, and especially vague on-center. The steering wheel is barely adjustable, the synthetic leather seats are neither easy to wipe down nor luxurious, and the interior simultaneously comes off as gaudy and cheap. It doesn’t feel like a six-figure truck.
From an engineering standpoint, it’s no standout, either. Despite an estimated 170 kilowatt-hours capacity battery pack—GMC hasn’t released exact kWh stats—the tri-motor 3X trim with the Extreme Off-Road Package is rated by the EPA at just 298 miles of range and 53 combined MPGe. Back-of-the-envelope math works out to 1.76 miles/kWh. The Hummer EV is one of the least-efficient electric vehicles on the road. It doesn’t even get to claim top dog in output as a tradeoff either, as its combined 830 horsepower is bested by the Rivian R1S Quad-Motor’s 835 HP. The Hummer's 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds is handily defeated by the Cybertruck Beast’s 2.6-second dash to 60 too.
Be assured that 3.5 seconds is still plenty fast in a truck this size. On hard merges, the front end thrusts skyward with such ferocity it feels like the SUV could take off with enough runway. Luckily, you won’t be flying skyward, as the Hummer weighs somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 pounds, a number that vividly comes to life when you jam the brakes at highway speeds. This mass got exhausting to manhandle on the way to Moab, but luckily GM’s superb Super Cruise level 2 automation comes standard.
Let us abandon rational auto-reviewer thought for a moment, though. Highway comfort and bragging rights be damned. In bright orange with the T-tops off, every living being in the city of Moab down to the kangaroo rats stared at me as I drove past. If you want attention—and Lord knows I do—it’s impossible to beat the Hummer, even with a Cybertruck.
And what better way to show off your Hummer—and yourself—than to tackle a trail that would leave lesser trucks, and men, broken and battered? This is where the Hummer can surpass its competition on paper. The Hummer EV has eye-watering off-road stats: 15.9 inches of maximum ground clearance, a 35.4-foot turning circle (aided by four-wheel steering), and a staggering 49.6-degree approach angle. This puts it far ahead of the Rivian R1S and Tesla Cybertruck, and the Hummer SUV boasts better breakover and departure than the nine-inch-longer-wheelbase Hummer EV Pickup. (The SUV even bests the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler 4xe in rock-crawling metrics.) Its off-road abilities in the electrified world stand alone.
Reality backs up those impressive numbers. Our test trail was a blue “More Difficult” 4x4 path that looped through the desert south of Moab. It’s a trail you could tackle in a Jeep on 35s, but that you’d still want heaps of body protection for, as it includes sharp rocks and staircase descents.
Putting the Hummer into Terrain Mode—which heavily dampens throttle response to allow for easier power modulation—allowed me to (mostly) gently coax the four-and-a-half-ton behemoth down stairs without riding the Extreme All Terrain Package’s rock sliders all the way. One-pedal driving was brilliant and used a combination of physical brakes and regenerative braking that was smooth all the way to zero, a rarity for any EV. Its underbody shielding could make an armadillo jealous; There isn’t a weak point underneath this truck, which gave me extra confidence when sliding down big steps.
Terrain mode also dials up the front/rear steering ratio to 1:1.2—for every one turn of the front wheels, the rears move 1.2 (up to their full ten degrees of angle). It feels absurd at first, but it’s an absolute necessity for the Hummer EV. Although its wheelbase is much shorter than its pickup sibling, it’s still 126.7 inches long—almost half a foot longer than a Chevrolet Tahoe. Once I got the hang of the rear end’s steering, it made the massive Hummer almost corner like a mid-size. If desired, the 3X can also enter parallel-steering mode (known as “crab walking” in Hummer parlance), but I only engaged it as a party trick—I struggle to envision an off-road scenario where it would be useful.
While the Hummer performed exceptionally in Moab for an almost 9,000-pound truck, I never forgot how massive it was. On the few sections of trail that weren’t slickrock, I watched the first and sixth trucks in our group deal with vastly different conditions, as the massive weight of the Hummer was too much for soft dirt, which fell away from the trail with every subsequent truck. I pinstriped the Afterburner Tintcoat on every patch of sagebrush in southern Utah, because at 86.7 inches—almost half a foot wider than a Hummer H2—it was simply too wide to fit most trails. My line choices were constrained to wherever I could physically fit the truck, which forced me into trickier maneuvers than I might need in a reasonably sized vehicle.
Despite this, its off-road abilities are currently unmatched in its competitive set, although the minute electrified Mercedes G-Wagen hits the market, that title will become much harder to defend. Even if it gets surpassed by the Benz: who cares? I maintain that attempting to rationally analyze the Hummer defeats its entire purpose. Get it in orange. Pop off the T-tops. Crank up Mötley Crüe. The Hummer is here to party, and it’ll get to the party whether it’s in Miami or Moab.

Mate noted during this week’s Financial Times Future of the Car Summit that a lot has changed since Rimac began developing the Nevera around 2017. While EV sales are slowing, consumers around the world have access to far more affordable options than they did a few years ago.
Governments have imposed strict regulations to spur EV adoption, and several automakers have already pledged to sell only EVs by a specific date. But some are open to altering those plans. Those forces are “pushing stuff on us that we don’t want,” and people are “a little bit repulsed by it,” Mate said, leading to a decline in demand for high-end EVs that's affecting his brand.
The Nevera hypercar is still for sale. The company has already delivered more than 50 cars to customers, but it had plans to produce 150 in total.
Falling demand and a shift in consumer trends mean that a Nevera successor might have some form of combustion power, Rimac suggests.
""Rimac isn’t exclusively electric; it’s doing whatever is most exciting at the time,” he said.
A pure EV won’t cut it, but a potent hybrid might, which might be one reason the Bugatti Chiron successor is getting that wild V-16 hybrid engine. Mate revealed in 2022 that two years before merging with Bugatti, Rimac had already started developing a combustion engine. The writing was on the wall.

Volkswagen's New California Camper Van Gets More Space and Hybrid Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/718804/new-volkswagen-california-camper-van-details/,"Each trim comes with a rooftop tent and two sliding rear doors, and some trims even get a kitchen.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Volkswagen has redesigned its California camper van for the European market. The mini motorhome, positioned between the Caddy California and the Grand California, is available with a new hybrid powertrain and is larger than its predecessor, creating a roomier cabin.
The new camper van will be available in five trims: Beach, Beach Tour, Beach Camper, Coast, and Ocean. Every model has a rooftop tent and two sliding doors with mosquito nets. Volkswagen will offer a new awning that's optional in some markets and standard in others for both sides of the vehicle.
Inside, Volkswagen has replaced the rear bench with two individual seats. Thankfully they can still transform into a bed. It means people can still put bikes in the back without losing a sleeping space.
Engineers also redesigned the full kitchenette available on the Coast and Ocean, pushing it rearward so passengers can still exit both sides of the vehicle. Accessible from the outside, it contains a sink, a single-burner gas stove, and cabinets. Step up to the Beach Camper trim and you get a permanent rear, slide-out mini kitchen with a gas stove, two drawers, and storage.
Each of the 53-pound rear seats are removable, and each comes equipped with a drawer for additional storage. VW has placed several 45-watt USB-C charging ports throughout the cabin. Occupants even have the ability to double-tap any light switch and turn off all interior LED and background lights simultaneously.
The Beach Tour trim and higher come with VW's new camper control unit in the passenger-side C-pillar. It's one way to control the various vehicle functions, which are accessible through the infotainment system and a smartphone app.
The Ocean is the flagship model, and comes complete with two camper batteries, two 230-volt outlets (one inside and one out), heated front seats, supplemental air heating, a roof storage compartment, a folding table, and a 7.4-gallon freshwater tank.
The new camper will go on sale with three powertrain choices, shared with the Multivan. The four-cylinder, 150-horsepower turbodiesel and the 204-hp gas engines power the front wheels. The new plug-in hybrid option comes with 4Motion all-wheel drive and 245 hp. It can also tow up to 4,409 pounds.

"Lucid Air Sapphire Versus Dodge Demon 170: Again, It's Not Even Close",https://www.motor1.com/news/718666/lucid-air-sapphire-drag-races-demon-170/,One of these cars was built specifically built for the drag strip. The other has all-wheel drive and tons of power.,12/25/2024 8:53,"The Lucid Air Sapphire drag racing chronicles continue. In the last few weeks, we've seen the 1,234-horsepower electric sedan clock a 1.77-second sprint from zero to 60 mph while running an 8.9-second quarter-mile time. That was a solo pass, and it backed up that performance by easily beating its direct competitor in the marketplace, the Tesla Model S Plaid.
The Dodge Challenger Demon 170 is not a Lucid Air competitor. One could easily argue these vehicles are polar opposites, but they do have one thing in common. Both are capable of running under 9 seconds at the drag strip. And now, we have them side-by-side in the latest DragTimes video. On paper, this should be a very close race. Reality, however, is a bit different.
Before we get to that, here's a quick review of the players. The Demon 170 is literally built to live the quarter-mile life. It has 1,025 horsepower from its supercharged V-8, and yes, it's filled with E85 so the engine computer should have all that power available for the runs. Big ol' drag tires are mounted on the back, and inside, you'll find just one seat for the driver. It's completely stock as ordered from the factory, right down to the Demon's dragstrip-tuned suspension that lets it pull wheelies off the line.
But the Lucid Air Sapphire is also factory stock. It has 1,234 hp from a tri-motor powertrain, but you won't find drag slicks on this sizable four-door sedan. It's running Michelin Pilot Sport street tires, and the interior is awash with seats for people to sit in front and back. It's not tuned for drag racing, but that doesn't stop it from beating everything at the track.
And without additional drama, that includes the Demon 170. Despite being built specifically for quarter-mile dragstrips, the Challenger loses this race at every step of the battle. The Demon's best run of three is the first pass where it goes 9.49 at 144.8 mph. But the Sapphire turns the quarter in 9.01 seconds at 153 mph, and it even leaves the line harder despite not having drag tires. The Air Sapphire's all-wheel drive claws its way to a 1.44-second 60-foot time, indicating it's launching very hard. The Demon launches hard too, but at 1.48 seconds, it's not hard enough.
What's next for the Lucid Air Sapphire? We're still holding out hope for a showdown with the Rimac Nevara. That should be quite a match, but until then, Lucid just might own the title for the world's quickest quarter-mile production car.

My Quad-Motor Go-Kart Broke Under Full Power,https://www.motor1.com/features/718121/quad-motor-go-kart-fixes/,A few fixes are in order before we power the front motors.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Adding voltage to an electric motor will increase its speed. Adding current will give it more torque. In the case of my quad-motor go-kart, the voltage is not going to change much. However, its motors' current will be going up a lot.
This was the situation I found myself in, trying to hop up the current rear-wheel-drive iteration of the kart. If you’re just tuning in, I’m making a quad-motor go-kart with a maximum potential output of 20 kilowatts, or around 26 horsepower. This is one part of my journey to unlock the full potential of this platform.
The factory-rated power for the motors—what voltage and current they can sustain indefinitely without overheating—is 2500 watts or around 50 amps at 48 volts. I planned to double the current, which is sustainable for short runs. As it turns out, though, overheating was the least of my worries.
All motors have two parts: the rotor and the stator. As you might glean from the name of the stator, it remains stationary while the rotor spins around or inside it. The rotor is what the actual wheel and tire are connected to.
The stator, in the case of every hub motor I've seen, is connected to a shaft which is either clamped or bolted onto the body/suspension of the vehicle. The hub motors of the popular hoverboard product, for instance, are simply clamped to the chassis. You can buy those motors cheaply on eBay, for what it’s worth. They don’t have integrated mechanical brakes, they aren’t very powerful, and they're a small diameter.
Mine are threaded, but a flat spot is milled on either side of the shaft in order to provide a sort of keyway to keep the stator from spinning. It would be nice if the threads on the shaft were reversed as well, so that if the stator did spin it would simply be tightening itself down instead of loosening (this is foreshadowing). That’s asking a lot of Alibaba, though.
My old three-wheel karts only ever put down around one kilowatt of power to an eight-inch wheel, so I never even needed a keyway. I just torqued the motor down with a ratchet slotted into the end of a jack handle, as is standard procedure. This time I figured that wouldn't work, because it didn’t on the Motocompacto Type R. So I slipped some heavy stainless steel keys over the motor shaft which were bolted to the frame. With these installed, I went out for my first test.
The first indication that those keys wouldn’t be enough was how fast this thing was, even on the motor’s recommended continuous power. The throttle really needs some tuning because it’s twitchy in the mid-range. As soon as you go near the pedal it sends a ton of current to the rear wheels, lurching the kart forward. There’s also a slight delay between coming off the throttle and the regenerative brakes engaging, which I’ve never experienced before. Not sure how to fix that.
My decision to add no caster in the steering also became very evident at higher speeds. Let me explain myself here.
I add ""sophisticated"" features to my karts one at a time so I can wrap my head around them and make sure they work. In this instance, that sophistication was kingpin inclination. Caster was something I didn’t feel like I had to do. My other karts didn’t have it and they handled just fine.
Plus, when the kart had suspension, I expected it to sag down under my weight, giving caster naturally. When I locked out the suspension, though, I didn’t add any caster back in. Ultimately, it’s all my fault.
The result of this extra power, combined with other design flaws, is terror. The steering feels heavier as the speed increases, but it’s also trying to dart all over the place. The steering wheel itself is also only connected to the steering column with two nuts done up against each other.
Since the steering force has gone up, the wheel slips at high speeds. I turn the wheel and the kart does not turn at the worst possible time. This was another one of those features that worked great on my smaller karts but did not translate at all to this bigger one.
All of these things came to a head in the same corner. And when I got back to my garage, I discovered the motors had rounded out those stainless keys like they were made of butter. All the wires were twisted into a pigtail.
Addressing these problems required a mix of actual fixes and some, uh, resourceful tweaks I made instead of rebuilding the steering.
I wasn’t going to turn the power down, so I needed thicker keys to hold the motor shaft straight. How about two pieces of three-eighth-inch steel? Good luck spinning that.
To fix the steering, I did two things. I tightened the nuts connecting every component on the kart and took some air out of the front tires. Hopefully, this would help dampen out some of those lack-of-caster impulses.
I also wanted to know why the regen wasn’t engaging properly, so I got a cheap tablet on Amazon and linked the inverter to it via Bluetooth. This way, I could track the current going in and out of the motor as well as monitor other diagnostics.
Most of that stuff actually worked. The rear wheels are now locked in place, and I know I can use the same sort of clips for the front wheels when the time comes to turn those on. The steering is also a lot better now, but the column still needs to be replaced with a keyed shaft.
The tablet didn’t tell me much about the regen problem, but at least now I have a full set of gauges to monitor the kart. I’m not sure how that’s going to work when I add another two inverters, though. Two tablets? Unclear.
Altogether, the kart now feels pretty good, but all of those small issues still exist in the back of my mind. The steering will eventually loosen, the regen still feels sketchy, etc. I need actual solutions to those problems, not temporary fixes.
There are a few other small changes to make to the kart too, but I’m going to experiment with putting that stuff on video for the next installment. I think a lot of this will be clearer and more interesting in that form. Until then, sit tight.

The New Honda Prelude Hybrid Will Reportedly Make 207 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/718255/honda-prelude-dimensions-horsepower-specs/,And it will be nearly identical in size to the Toyota GR86.,12/25/2024 8:53,"At last year's Tokyo Auto Show, Honda surprised everyone by revealing the Honda Prelude Concept. The company has already confirmed it'll eventually produce the two-door hybrid coupe, and a new report from Best Car Web provides an insight into the car's alleged powertrain details, dimensions, and Japanese price.
We already know it'll have a hybrid powertrain, which the chief engineer Tomoyuki Yamagami said would serve as a ""prelude"" to Honda's future electric vehicles. Best Car believes it'll have the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder e:HEV engine that powers the Accord and Civic hybrids, making a bit more than both with a combined 207 horsepower. The last Prelude in 2001 made 200 hp in the US.
The Prelude will supposedly measure 169.3 inches long, 70.5 inches wide, and 51.2 inches tall with a 101.4-inch wheelbase. That makes it bigger than the two-seat Mazda MX-5 Miata at 154.1 inches long, which isn't surprising, and nearly identical to the Toyota GR86 in size with matching wheelbases.
Honda is reportedly positioning it as a premium model positioned above the two-door Toyota. It'll apparently cost ¥4.2 to ¥4.5 million ($27,325 at $29,277 today’s exchange rate) in Japan, more than the ¥2.9- to ¥3.6-million ($18,867 to $23,422) GR86, but it’s best to the the publication’s report with a big grain of salt as its past reports haven’t always been accurate.
The Prelude isn't expected to arrive until the second half of 2025, and it won't be the ""sportiest, zippiest car"" in the world, so temper your track-day expectations. It is also unclear whether Honda plans to sell it in the United States. The automaker is developing the Prelude in both left- and right-hand-drive configurations, so there's a chance we might get it here, but nothing is official.

Should You Buy An EV Track Car?,https://www.motor1.com/features/718124/buy-ev-track-car-hyundai-ioniq/,"Hyundai’s boxy Ioniq 5 N provides a best-case argument, but lap times aren’t the limiting factor for go-fast EVs.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Alright, I’m a believer now.
EVs can stir up joy like nearly any production track tool, so long as they follow Hyundai’s lead.
But just because something can perform a task doesn’t make it the best tool for the job. Or even a particularly good one. (Shout out to my long-suffering Tacoma, which sinks against its bump stops like some soggy peasant when hauling a yard of soil from Home Depot).
During the media drive of the Ioniq 5 N at Laguna Seca, the Hyundai hammered down the track’s front straight, again and again without fatigue. This hot hatch’s hole-shot pace would heat check many supercars, and in the corners, you could play it scalpel-neat or flick the Hyundai’s tail against the exit curbing like Ott Tänak.
But each successive lap left me wondering, ""Could you actually own one of these as a dual-purpose daily driver track special? Should you?""
In our first drive of the car, I answered the question in a couple sentences, but the review was not solely focused on the I5N’s viability as a track car. Inquiring minds will want to know, could you actually daily an EV track car and enjoy it?
Let’s break it down.
Track days are not race days, but anyone who says pride’s off the line is lying. Nobody spends $67,000 on a track special to point by a Spec Miata. Thankfully, Hyundai's N department handled this one.
By any objective performance measure, this 4,861-pound, crossover-sized hot hatch performs miracles. Hyundai says it’ll hit sixty in 3.2 seconds from a stop, but my butt dyno says it’s slightly quicker (note: my butt dyno was calibrated by several years testing vehicle performance for Road & Track). Same goes for lateral grip, though I think Pirelli left a fair amount of performance on the table in favor of longevity and civility. I wonder aloud what a set of the stickiest Michelin Cup tires would unlock here.
German publication Sport Auto clocked a 7:45 at the Nurburgring in a bone-stock I5N. It’s not the production EV record, mind you, but mind the context as well. That’s within striking distance of the Lexus LFA. That’s 997 Turbo fast. It’s on par with the Civic Type R, yet another giant slayer with racetrack bona fides, and a sniff slower than the 991.2 911 S.
Watch the onboard video itself. Unlike most performance EVs, including the record-holding Porsche Taycan Turbo GT, the I5N thrives under track abuse rather than merely tolerating it. The Hyundai’s cooling-centric powertrain design allows it two full laps of the ‘Ring before a recharge, with battery, brake, and tire temps in check the whole way. A Tesla will do three quarters of a ‘Ring lap before you’ve cooked it.
This is a meaningful distinction for track-day dorks; In capable hands, the I5N is quick enough to scrap with anything, whether it's your outlap, or the end of a standard 30-minute HPDE session.
You never simply arrive and drive. You’re hauling a the set of track-centric wheels and tires, a floor jack, a big honkin’ torque wrench, the cordless impact driver, a pop-up tent, and at least a few more track-specific odds and ends.
Again, you’re good with the I5N. A Hyundai rep said the car’s hatch will swallow a full set of four 21-inch spares, and the eyeball test suggests there’s plenty more room for track day accoutrement in the rear hold, plus a passenger up front. I can’t tell you how many times I drove a BMW E36 to and from the track with a great greasy Hoosier riding shotgun. Thankfully, that’s not necessary here.
Thermal management is any go-fast production car’s greatest foil. Ask anyone who drove the last-gen Civic Type R on a hot track. This rule counts double for EVs, which generate heat from their batteries, brakes, and tires like a reactor in thermal runaway.
The Ioniq 5 N, for example, totes something like a ton of batteries in its belly. Every time you go full throttle down a straightaway, those batteries generate monster power for the motors. This process generates monster heat in turn, degrading the battery’s State Of Charge.
I lost roughly 13 percent SOC for every three hot laps of Laguna, plus a moderately paced cooldown lap. At roughly two-and-a-quarter miles per lap, that meant 10 miles of lapping per session and 40 miles of on-track driving. After three sessions, the I5N’s SOC dropped from 94 to 54 percent. You could extrapolate that range to your local track, to gauge viability. Expect they Hyundai’s State-Of-Charge to drop further than the 13-percent-per-10-miles relationship would suggest, if you go out for longer sessions.
That’s the price of the I5N’s inertia. It takes huge brakes, an aggressive tune of the regenerative braking feature (which generates more heat), and ample tire to rein the I5N into a slow corner from a fast straight.
We did a few sessions at Laguna Seca, the first included a sighting lap and then three quick-ish laps, plus a cool-down. A couple more sessions followed with three laps each and a cool-down. I kept a curious eye on the front and rear motor temps, and the battery temp, which found an operating window and deviated little across the course of a given lap. The brakes held up to the I5N’s monster curb weight just fine, as did the Pirellis, though those did start to go a bit greasy as the sessions wore on.
A special note on the stock Pirellis. They’re quite talkative, leading you up to their limit with a hearty wraowraowraowraow. That additional feedback helps the I5N along on its mission to re-engage the driver’s senses, as does the tires’ penchant for a clean and linear breakaway between gripping and slipping.
I had a lengthy conversation with a Pirelli engineer on the project. He insisted that designing an EV track tire isn’t so different from designing for any OEM project; You provide the client a balance between performance, longevity, and civility, tailored to their taste. But performance-EV tires suffer tremendously at the hands of three-ton curb weights, paired to the instant snap of torque, and warp-speed acceleration. For the most part, the Pirellis held up just fine at Laguna.
I checked shoulder wear visually between our lapping sessions and felt around for how heat was soaking into the tires. All seemed well. No chunks or fissures broke out of the tires’ treads or shoulders. No excess hot spots across their breadth. Honestly, I was impressed by how well these tires handled the Ioniq’s considerable mass.
However, I suspect our lapping sessions were kept brief for a reason. The physics at work here would surely punish any set of tires, regardless of brand or compound, over longer HPDE sessions. I’d recommend taking advantage of the I5N’s cargo space, finding a cheap set of lightweight alloys (18” wheels fit on the I5N Cup car, which is mechanically identical) and some tires aimed at durability, rather than ultimate lap times.
Alright, here’s the rub. In every performance metric, the I5N is absolutely ready for your next track day. But as with garden-variety EV adoption, charging is the hang-up. Or, rather, a lack of charging infrastructure.
If your track doesn’t have an 800-volt fast charger, which it almost certainly doesn’t, you’re probably SOL. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, or that you can’t get a decent amount of lapping in under perfect conditions.
I’d bet at most tracks in America, you could get away with a pair of 30-minute lapping sessions in the morning, a break for off-site fast charging over lunch, then a few more 15-minute sessions in the afternoon, with enough battery left to get you home before rush hour. That’s not exactly a double stint at LeMans, but many outfits that run track days limit participants to sessions around 15-20 minutes, lest the Red Mist descends.
For a small percentage of Americans who live close enough to a race track and have access to at-home charging, I think the I5N could fit nicely
It should be said Hyundai is actively working to build and/or facilitate the building of fast chargers at race tracks. But this will take broader interest from consumers to seal the deal. Race tracks are often in remote locations, which in turn requires significant investment to upgrade even simple infrastructure, let alone infrastructure to facilitate an incredibly niche.
We’re just not there yet. Not even close. But cars like the I5N bridge the gap between performance EVs and the track day workflow we’re accustomed to. Ultimately, it won’t be up to the automakers to deliver a product that’s track-capable. Hyundai’s just done it. Mass adoption of EV track cars will depend entirely on the charging infrastructure at or near the track.
For now, the track-day masses wait.
But a select few—those in fair-weather states who live close to a race track with fast charging nearby—will have a ball with the Ioniq 5 N. For the price, you won’t find much that’ll lap your local bull ring any quicker. Remember, a base Cayman starts at $68,300 and for that price, its owner will have the pleasure of waving by an EV hatchback with the badge of a Korean upstart on the hood and a grinning face behind the wheel.

Stellantis Could Put Gas Engines Back in EVs if There's Enough Demand,https://www.motor1.com/news/718129/stellantis-will-put-combustion-engines-in-evs/,"Company CFO Natalie Knight emphasized the flexible nature of the platforms, but that doesn't mean the EV revolution won't happen.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Stellantis has ambitious plans to have an entirely electric passenger-vehicle lineup in Europe by 2030. In the United States, the goal is 50 percent. This is the crux of the conglomerate's Dare Forward 2030 plan, and despite the cooldown on EVs in the US, it's still full-speed ahead. But that doesn't mean the company won't build combustion-powered cars if that's what buyers want.
That's the takeaway from a recent report by WardsAuto, which cites Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight talking about the flexibility to build combustion-powered vehicles from electric platforms. It's not the first time we've heard a Stellantis executive talk about flexibility, but the report presents things in a broader spectrum. In short, if demand is there for a combustion version of an EV, Stellantis is open to building it.
""I don’t want to ignore the fact that we want to stay close to the consumer, and if we see there’s an opportunity with those models that we introduced as a BEV first, we’ll look at that,"" she said, according to WardsAuto.
Despite its all-electric endgame, Stellantis has a fresh range of STLA platforms designed to accommodate either electric or combustion powertrains. The company sees it as an advantage going forward, and why not? As the auto industry pivots from combustion to electric, having such flexibility is certainly an advantage. But one can't help but contemplate the larger question here. What happens if, come 2030, 75 percent of buyers in the US want a combustion vehicle? Will that override the 50-percent plan outlined in Dare Forward 2030?
While the future is uncertain, a Stellantis spokesperson confirmed to us that, as of now, the company isn't changing or reconsidering aspects of its 2030 goal. 50 percent electric in the US and 100 percent in Europe is still the plan. In Europe, EV sales are still doing well. Things stateside aren't quite as rosy, though some models are doing better than others. But, 2030 is just six years away. Unless the automotive market makes a significant adjustment, a new-car lineup that's 50 percent electric could be a hard sell for US buyers.

Pininfarina Made An Electric Batmobile You Can Actually Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/718046/pininfarina-b95-battista-batman/,"If you have as much money as Bruce Wayne, of course.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Automobili Pininfarina has created a new line of ultra-exclusive cars that take their styling inspiration from Batman’s civilian persona, Bruce Wayne. The two models—the B95 and Battista—feature unique design touches tailored to make you feel like the billionaire comic book hero.
Pininfarina created two trims for its two cars: Gotham and Dark Knight. Gotham cars feature tan leather upholstery, bespoke center panel quilting, and tan stitching. The other trim uses black Alcantara, black leather upholstery, and black and gold duo-tone contrast stitching.
The Gotham Battista wears Argento Vittorio gloss paint on its exterior and has a Nero Torino roof. Pininfarina backlit its iconic logo, finishing it in brushed and polished anodized aluminum. The car has 20-inch front and 21-inch rear alloy wheels with gloss-black faces and matte-black rims. The B95 wheels closely match the Battista’s, featuring matte-black inner and gloss-black outer rings.
The Dark Knight Battista and B95 have Nero Profondo exteriors and Nero Torino roofs. They also share the same ceramic-polished rims.
Each car has a 120.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery powering four electric motors that generate 1,900 horsepower. The B95 and Battista can fly to 62 miles per hour in less than two seconds. The displays feature Wayne Enterprises enhancements and an instruction voice modeled after Alfred Pennyworth.
Pininfarina also tweaked the Battista’s aerodynamics, giving it new tailgate shark fins, louver openings, and rear carbon wings. It also has Wayne Enterprises logos on the side skirts and roof.
The special Pininfarina cars are the latest in a line of new products looking to wring every bit of value out of the Batman brand. The automaker and Wayne Enterprises, a luxury brand developed by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products, will launch their partnership at BruceWayneX.com and host an “invite-only, first-of-its-kind retail theatre concept” this summer where a lucky few will get to see a Battista. The site also has limited-edition jet skis, bicycles, and the iconic Tumbler from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy.
Pininfarina doesn't how much these two Batman-themed special editions might cost, but the Battista starts at $2.2 million and the B95 costs $4.8 million. So you'll need to be as rich as Bruce Wayne.

Italdesign’s 777-HP Concept Car Is Almost a Pickup Truck,https://www.motor1.com/news/717878/italdesign-quintessenza-ev-concept-truck/,"The rear roof comes off, exposing a small bed accessible via an electronic tailgate.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Italdesign’s latest creation blends a sleek GT car with a pickup truck to create a vehicle tailer-made for looking up at the stars. It’s up for debate as to whether the Quintessenza succeeds at being either body style, as it’s just a concept, but the EV’s sleek design hides some wild styling features that should excite the stargazer in all of us.
The Quintessenza is big. It’s longer than the shortest Ford F-150, with a lengthier 127.6-inch wheelbase. All that space helps accommodate four seats with a central console running down the middle that houses the infotainment controls and other switches. It also contains an organizer and a refrigerated mini-bar large enough to fit a bottle of wine and two glasses.
You’ll want a drink when you flip around the rear seats and remove the rear hardtop, opening the cabin to the outside world. The center console can slide back, bringing the mini bar right to you as you recline the rear seats and enjoy the sights.
At the front of the cabin, a floating central dashboard at the base of the windshield blends into the doors and wraps to the rear of the car. Italdesign made the dashboard out of a marble-based fabric that hides the controls underneath until needed, using a projection-based system to display them. It sounds fancy and fussy.
The primary vehicle interface is located behind the steering wheel, which is nothing more than a dock for your smartphone, which connects with the car through a unique app. Users can control various vehicle settings through the phone, which can also display vital information when it’s docked, such as battery level, speed, turn signals, and more.
The minimalist interior is serene compared to the rugged exterior. The Quintessenza has chunky fender flares over 24-inch wheels, sharp vertical and horizontal lighting elements front and rear, and a fastback roof that hides the truck bed. It can adjust its ground clearance from 7.9 to 11.0 inches. There are even full-length scissor doors and an electronically powered tailgate.
Powering the EV is a 150-kilowatt-hour battery feeding three electric motors—one front-axle drive unit and two in-wheel rear-axle motors. The total output is 777 horsepower, and it can reach 62 miles per hour in less than three seconds, but Italdesign doesn't mention anything about towing or payload capacities.
Either way, this thing is cool. While it probably won't ever see production, we're glad it exists.

"Four Companies Are Still Interested In Saving Fisker, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/717836/fisker-four-automakers-interested/,So you're saying there's a chance?,12/25/2024 8:53,"Fisker has had a bumpy few months, to say the least. After the company said it would need to partner with another automaker before it went bankrupt, talks with Nissan fell apart. Then Fisker quickly slashed prices on inventory for a version of the Ocean SUV that may or may not even exist. But there’s still a small glimmer of hope.
According to Business Insider, CEO Henrik Fisker held an all-hands meeting last week and told employees that at least four automakers are still interested in a potential stake in the company. ""We do have four car companies that have signed NDAs,"" Fisker told his employees last week. ""However, they obviously need time to get to some diligence.""
Fisker didn’t provide a timetable or any specifics on which companies might be interested. Nissan almost certainly won’t be one of them after talks fell apart following a rumored $400-million deal that would kickstart production of the Alaska pickup and a separate electric pickup for Nissan.
If Fisker doesn’t strike a deal with any of these four automakers within the next 30 days, bankruptcy could be inevitable. The company reportedly has just $54 million in cash equivalencies and says that will ""not be sufficient to meet its current obligations."" This comes months after the company delivered hundreds of cars while failing to collect millions of dollars worth of payment.
We’ll see in the next few weeks if Fisker is able to strike a deal and stay afloat, or if bankruptcy is right around the corner.

Here's An Exceedingly Nerdy Explanation of GM's Ultium Battery System,https://www.motor1.com/features/717675/gm-ultium-battery-deep-dive/,"We spoke with Jerry Beemer, the head of GM’s EV Propulsion team.",12/25/2024 8:53,"The Cadillac Lyriq is one of the first vehicles to use GM’s Ultium platform. This drivetrain system now underpins all of its current and upcoming electric vehicles, other than the outgoing Chevy Bolt EV. After driving the Lyriq and liking it very much, I was interested in the precise details of the car’s pack and the larger Ultium system. So I interviewed Jerry Beemer, who leads GM’s EV Propulsion team. If you want to know everything about this system down to the individual cells, he’s your guy.
The Ultium platform currently consists of packs made from the same building blocks. The core of this system is the Ultium battery cell, a long and slender 103 amp-hour (Ah)  pouch utilizing a derivative of the nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) chemistry. That means a peak voltage of around 4.2V and a nominal voltage of around 3.6V. The upcoming Chevy Bolt will allegedly be on the same platform but will utilize a lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry. That means the peak cell voltage will be around 3.65V, with nominal coming in around 3.2V.
It’s unclear if these cells will take the same shape as the current Ultium cells, but Beemer told me the cell itself is not vital to the platform. In China, for instance, “We sell Lyriqs with a module-based pack like we have today, but it’s a different chemistry, a different form factor of prismatic cans in those packs” Beemer said.
In other words, key things like the battery management system, module-centric pack construction, and other details, like how power electronics communicate with each other are what make Ultium what it is. The system is not defined by the 103Ah cell that most of GM’s North American EVs use.
Speaking of these cells, 24 are stuffed into each of the Lyriq’s modules in a 8S 3P configuration, giving a nominal module voltage of roughly 29V. Every module is wired in series to achieve the Lyriq’s 96S pack configuration. This detail belies GM’s confidence in its lower voltage architecture. A rework in module construction would be required to push the voltage higher. Because of this, vehicles carrying fewer modules than the Lyriq will likely operate at a lower voltage.
The Hummer EV utilizes the same cells and modules, however the pack configuration of that monster is 96S 6P—effectively two Lyriq packs stacked on top of each other. The Hummer drives its motors at 400V but can charge at 800V thanks to contactors that wire the pack’s two halves in series, effectively providing a 192S 3P layout.
In terms of feeding the drivetrain with that higher voltage, Beemer said the automaker “looked at 800 volts… in the context of full-line manufacturing.”
However, GM doesn’t believe higher drive voltages are a key piece of the puzzle, at least right now. “[I won’t] say that we won’t ever go there,” Beemer told me, but he indicated that driving lower costs by building production volume was a more important first step.
The lower voltage clearly isn’t hurting the system’s discharge rates. The Hummer’s battery, despite operating in the region of 400V, can still provide a burst of 745 kilowatts (1,000 horsepower). The AWD Lyriq with half of the modules can logically provide a peak output of around 373 kW (500 hp).
The Lyriq can charge at 190kW continuously from a station. Calculating a peak charge voltage is difficult because GM is understandably cagey about revealing the Ultium cell’s charge and discharge voltage buffer—other automakers developing battery packs would love to know that kind of thing.
This buffer is the difference between the calculated pack capacity with a known peak voltage, derived from the chemistry, and the stated usable capacity from GM. To be precise, each cell is not getting charged to its max of around 4.2V and is not discharged to its minimum of 2.0V-2.8V mostly for the sake of cycle life and safety. A peak estimate of 4.1V would mean a charging voltage of 393.6V.
In terms of burst charging under regenerative braking, the Lyriq can harvest up to an observed 240 kW, which speaks to the confidence GM has in the system. If it were conservative, we wouldn’t see regenerative braking figures much higher than the pack’s continuous charge rate.
It will be even more interesting to see where the automaker takes these charge/discharge rates in the Lyriq V, which is a widely speculated performance version of the car. It will likely push these charge/discharge limits even higher, perhaps without changing out the core cell.
Indeed, Beemer said the automaker has “not realized the full potential” of the unit yet. In the case of GM, this means working out the physics of what should happen to the cell/module/pack under certain conditions, and correlating that information to test data.
“The vast majority of our work now is analytical and then supported by a few key tests that validate,” Beemer said.
So while GM applies its 103 Ah cell in the 8S 3P module to most of its EVs, testing data may indicate that different configurations are possible. As the automaker gets further into electrification, we can expect more potential to be unlocked from whatever form factor seems ideal, whether it’s pouches, cylindrical cells, or prismatic cans.
An exciting time in the world of electric vehicles.

The G80 EV Magma Is the Hottest Concept From Genesis Yet,https://www.motor1.com/news/717469/genesis-g80-ev-magma-concept/,"The concept has a performance-tuned suspension, a body kit, and a stunning blue paint job.",12/25/2024 8:53,"The Genesis performance sub-brand Magma is back with a new car. But unlike previous concepts, this one isn't orange. The G80 EV Magma Concept sports a color called Acme Blue. Chosen not because of its electric powertrain, but because blue is the hottest part of a flame, according to Genesis.
Does this mean the G80 EV Magma Concept is the fastest car from the brand yet? There's no way to tell right now. Debuting at Auto China in Beijing, Genesis talks about suspension upgrades, bigger brakes, and aesthetic changes to give the concept a meaner stance. But the company's remained mum on powertrain specs so far.
The production-spec Electrified G80 gets a dual-motor arrangement generating a modest 365 horsepower. While it's unclear whether the Magma Concept uses a version of this powertrain or something totally different, we're confident there's more power on tap.
Instead of harping on output, Genesis focuses on the concept's wider fenders, new rear fascia with an integrated diffuser, and a small ducktail spoiler on the trunk lid. There's also a new fascia at the front with larger air intakes, and blacked-out trim. The G80 EV Magma Concept rides on an ""advanced suspension system"" that lowers the car, but specific changes aren't outlined. Larger brakes are mounted behind custom 21-inch wheels that look identical to those on the GV60 Magma Concept, albeit with blue highlights. Interior upgrades include Alcantara and quilted leather with carbon fiber trim.
This isn't the first performance-focused G80 we've seen. Earlier this year, Genesis announced a limited-run model for the Middle East market called the Magma Special. That one isn't electric, with rumors suggesting it could have a 500-horsepower version of the sedan's 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6. It's also not the first electric Magma we've seen—that honor goes to the aforementioned GV60 that debuted at the end of March at the New York Auto Show.
The latest debut expands the Magma family, though at this time it's unknown if this concept will see production.

Toyota's Hybrid Truck System Will Be a Game-Changer. Here's How It Works,https://www.motor1.com/features/717505/toyota-i-force-max-hybrid-truck-explainer/,The chief engineers of Toyota’s mid-size trucks explain the new four-cylinder hybrids.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Toyota has built hybrids for over a quarter-century now, but only recently started electrifying its trucks. It’s a big deal, because the automakers' trucks have always been defined by their absolute dependability. Consequently, they’ve always lagged behind the market in terms of powertrain technology. For trucks, Toyota likes to stick with what it knows works, rather than coming up with something new for newness sake.
Now, Toyota has two hybrid truck powertrains, one with a twin-turbo V-6 for the Tundra and Sequoia, and one with a single-turbo four-cylinder for the Tacoma, 4Runner, and Land Cruiser. At the first drive for the Land Cruiser and Tacoma hybrid, we took a deep dive into the four-cylinder setup.
“For environmental concerns, America obviously has strict regulations, so for us, to ensure that as many customers as possible can enjoy the vehicle… there was a need for us to take on the challenge to improve the environmental friendliness and also the fuel efficiency,” said Ketia Moritsu, chief engineer for the new 4Runner and Land Cruiser, through an interpreter.
It’s called i-Force Max, and it’s not really like Toyota’s long-running Prius hybrid system. In fact, it’s a lot simpler to understand. Here, you have a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, an eight-speed automatic, and a 48-horsepower electric motor-generator sandwiched in between. The motor is powered by (and charges up) a 1.9-kilowatt-hour Nickel-Metal-Hydride battery mounted under the rear seats. Total system output is 326 hp and 465 pound-feet of torque.

“[The motor] is fundamentally designed to really support that part of the torque ramp and power ramp where you know the turbos are coming up to speed,” said Sheldon Brown, chief engineer for the Tacoma. “It helps us with our peak torque and then of course, when our turbo efficiency starts to fall off, it can come back in and assist.”
Because of the small battery, the Tacoma Hybrid doesn’t have a dedicated EV mode. It can drive around on pure electricity at the ECU’s discretion, briefly, at low speeds, and the system can shut off the engine for coasting on the highway. Fuel economy isn’t the priority either. Compared with their gas-only equivalents, hybrid Tacomas get around 2 mpg more in the city, 1 mpg more on the highway, and 1 mpg more combined. Really, this is about performance.
“We didn’t follow the path of just a hybrid system that focuses on fuel economy,” Moritsu explained. “So powerful, torquey, agile, maneuverability, and performance, those were the priorities. And we were able to balance that with the environmental performance of the vehicle as well. That was the biggest challenge for development.”
In terms of reliability, the hybrid system itself shouldn’t prove too problematic. Moritsu assured us of this. Toyota’s used Nickel-Metal-Hydride battery chemistry since the beginning, and while this isn’t the most energy dense, it's a well-proven technology. “We love it for its durability,” Brown said.
The electric motor itself is a fairly simple device, too. Really, the big concern for reliability in a truck is the engine.
“First and foremost, a lot of the truck duty cycle is really happening on the engine side,” Brown explained.
The 2.4-liter in the Tacoma is shared with many other Toyota products, notably the Highlander and Grand Highlander. But it’s very different for the trucks.
“There are internal components to the engine that are also specced up, maybe bearing coatings as an example, something that are going to see a longer or higher duty cycle,” Brown said. “Specifically when we start to think about things like the turbo, for example, it's really important that we think about truck duty cycles, they're gonna be towing, which means you're gonna be in the boost mode a lot more. You might be lugging in a reduction gear, which means your RPMs are up. Especially on these trucks, you're going to be giving it the beans, running through the desert. So we go to our commercial grade in terms of design requirements as well as our testing protocols for those.”
That means designing for a 50-percent longer duty cycle, and for more truck-specific scenarios. “We take the time to really consider how the truck is used,” Brown said “These trucks are going to be crawling up big hills, going down. We take a look at how the oil is actually moving throughout the engine, making sure that you're not starving the engine for oil when you're crawling up a 30-percent grade.”

Using a conventional automatic transmission enables a good tow rating and the inclusion of a low-range transfer case, an off-roading essential. Though this actually did present a problem. In the Tacoma, for example, the low-range gear is 2.57:1, which is a big torque multiplier when you’ve got 465 pound-feet on tap. Brown told us Toyota actually had to change the throttle map for 4-Low, to make sure drivers can manage all that torque when precise control is needed.
We tested the four-cylinder hybrid powertrain earlier this month in both the Land Cruiser and Tacoma. Off-road, the calibration is such that you don’t even really notice the hybrid powertrain at work. Which was the goal.
“We were in a review one time, and I said to [the engineering teams], ‘The highest compliment I can give you is this was unremarkable because it just did everything I wanted to do when I wanted it to,’” Brown said.
On the road, the torque of the hybrid system is noticeable compared with the standard gas-only Tacoma, but again, it all works seamlessly. You don’t think about the fact that it’s a hybrid.
Only time can reveal if this powertrain ranks up there with Toyota’s best, but know that these are nameplates the company takes very seriously. If Toyota is going to go hybrid for trucks, it can’t miss. On early exposure, it seems they haven’t.

The Company Behind the Hummer EV Camper Conversion Just Went Out of Business,https://www.motor1.com/news/717488/gmc-hummer-ev-earthcruiser-out-of-business/,EarthCruiser's last day of operations is April 25.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Pour one out for EarthCruiser. The Oregon-based company that built a modest range of overlanding vehicles is officially out of business. In a statement posted to EarthCruiser's website, the company's last day of business is Thursday, April 25.
Changes in the market and economic factors are cited in EarthCruiser's announcement as reasons for the closure.
""Our journey over the past years has been extraordinary,” said Lance Gillies, EarthCruiser CIO and founder. ""We are incredibly grateful to our loyal customers, dedicated employees, and industry partners for their support and trust in our brand. Although this decision marks the end of an era, we are proud of our legacy and impact on the world of travel, automotive innovation, and overlanding. We hope our vehicles, our customers, and their stories will continue to inspire the adventurous spirit in all of us.""
EarthCruiser was founded in 2008, and offered a handful of camper conversion builds based on a variety of vehicles. The least expensive choice was the $350,000 Terranova, built on a Ford Super Duty or Ram 3500 one-ton pickup truck platform. For a starting price of $595,000, EarthCruiser had the single-cab FX or dual-cab EXP, utilizing a four-wheel-drive Isuzu platform with V-8 power.
There was also the GMC Hummer EV EarthCruiser, which debuted in August 2023. The upfit added a carbon-fiber camper shell with a power-operated roof, creating space to stand up as well as room for a full-size bed. It added a small kitchen and shower to the off-road EV, powered by a 605-watt solar system and a 6-kilowatt-hour battery. With sizable tanks for fresh and gray water, EarthCruiser said it was capable of off-grid living for seven days.
Deliveries for the GMC Hummer EV EarthCruiser were to begin this summer, but that's obviously not happening. In an email to Motor1, an EarthCruiser representative confirmed that just the single demonstration model was built and has already been sold. No customer models were made, but the company is open to selling the design as part of the asset liquidation to any interested party.

The Kia EV9 GT Arrives January 2025 with 'Enormous Power',https://www.motor1.com/news/717574/kia-ev9-gt-january-2025-debut/,"Meanwhile, an updated EV6/EV6 GT and Sportage will debut later this year.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Kia released business results for the first quarter of 2024, full of the usual sales and financial jargon. But with that press release, the company also published a recording of its CEO's Investor Day speech that took place earlier this month. And in it we discovered some juicy details about upcoming product.
The EV9 GT will break cover in January 2025 with ""enormous power"" from an upgraded dual-motor setup. Kia says it'll do 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds, which is impressive given the large SUV’s heft, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds. We’re expecting a major power boost over the 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet offered by the most potent version on sale today. The additional oomph will help the GT version shave off more than one second from the sprint time.
Unless Kia plans to improve the battery chemistry, the range will probably to take a hit. That's what usually happens when an EV gets the performance treatment at the expense of efficiency. The EV9 GT-Line available today does 270 miles on a single charge, per EPA. Kia mentions the full-fat GT model is getting a beefier suspension setup and upgraded brakes.
This isn't the only electric Kia SUV about to spawn a GT version. Although not mentioned during the CEO Investor Day, the EV5 GT (pictured below) has already made an early appearance in China. It was recently homologated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, with images showing up on MIIT's website.
Later during the presentation, which we've attached below, a product roadmap was displayed in the background. An updated EV6 is scheduled for a market launch in the second quarter of this year. The sporty EV6 GT will follow in early Q4. Kia also plans to tweak the popular Sportage in the final quarter of the year. Elsewhere, the first-ever EV3 and new K4 are coming in Q3 when the large K8 sedan unavailable in the United States is bound to get a mid-cycle facelift.
But first, a five-door hatchback version of the also-not-for-America K3 compact sedan is coming soon.

This Lotus Evija Broke A Very Specific Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/717421/lotus-evija-x-debut/,The 6:24 lap is the fastest of any car with a chassis of a production model.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Remember that wild Lotus Evija X we saw last year testing at the Nürburgring? It's now finally out. Strictly a one-off, the electric beast is a track-only version of the hypercar that holds a very specific record for being the fastest vehicle around the Nordschleife with the chassis of a production car. Allow us to explain.
It completed the lap in 6 minutes and 24 seconds, or 11 seconds less than the Mercedes-AMG One. The F1-engined machine is the fastest street-legal car ever around the 'Ring. However, the Lotus Evija X is not the fastest car overall to complete a lap of the Green Hell. The Volkswagen ID.R took 6:05 while the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo remains unbeaten, at an incredible 5:19.
Because neither the ID. R nor the 919 Hybrid Evo has any connection with production models, Lotus can brag about the Evija X's performance. It's worth noting that there has been another car faster than the Lotus beyond those two. In 1983, Stefan Bellof drove the 956 to a 6:11 lap. In the same year and with the same car, Jochen Mass crossed the finish line in 6:16.
The Evija X is likely to return to the Nürburgring and try to shave off seconds from its already impressive lap time. The performance it achieved back in October 2023 was on a damp track, so there's room for improvement. Lotus says we should ""watch this space"" regarding a potentially better time.
Aside from the crazy aero with a massive wing, the track car has Pirelli slicks along with new dampers and carbon fiber brakes. Underneath the skin is the same carbon fiber tub and quad-motor setup with 2,011 horsepower and 1,257 pound-feet of torque as found in the street-legal Evija. The four electric motors draw their juice from a relatively small 70-kWh battery pack mid-mounted behind the seats.
Lotus touts a 0 to 62 mph in less than three seconds and a 62 to 124 mph in under three seconds as well. The 124 mph to 186 mph sprint is said to take less than four seconds. Flat out, the road car is electronically capped at 218 mph. The road-going Evija has entered production many years after its debut, and only 130 units will be assembled.

The Mazda Arata Is Another Attempt At An Electric SUV,https://www.motor1.com/news/717414/mazda-arata-electric-suv-concept/,"The MX-30 isn't exactly a roaring success, but Mazda isn't giving up.",12/25/2024 8:53,"The main star at Mazda's stand in Beijing at the Auto China 2024 is unquestionably the rear-wheel-drive electric 6 sedan. However, it's not the only premiere. A sleek-looking electric SUV concept called the Arata also debuted in China, and it's destined to go into production by the end of next year.
Much like the EZ-6 sedan, the Arata has been developed by Changan Mazda, a 50:50 joint venture between Changan Automobile and Mazda founded in late 2012. It's likely to adopt a different moniker for the production version, possibly an alphanumeric designation to echo the other SUVs. The ""EZ-60"" nameplate has already been trademarked in China and therefore might be used for this vehicle.
Meanwhile, the Arata (Japanese for ""new"" or ""fresh"") previews an attractive electric SUV that could be related to an existing product. While the EZ-6 is expected to be a reskinned Changan Depal SL03, the EZ-60 is likely to be based on the Changan Deepal S7. However, these will be more than just cases of swapping badges and calling it a day since there are major design differences. We reckon the Mazda sedan and SUV duo looks significantly more upmarket to justify what will likely be a higher price tag.
The Arata is strictly an EV, at least for now, whereas the EZ-6 going on sale this year in China will also be sold with a plug-in hybrid setup. The SUV also adopts the familiar Kodo design language and has relatively small windows and sleek lights front and rear. Just like the sedan, it gets an illuminated grille. The large ""Mazda"" script on the sides also lights up.
Since it's still a concept, it has cameras instead of conventional mirrors and also does away with door handles and a rear wiper. Mazda gave it a chunky spoiler bisected by a vertical third brake light that seems to extend to the roof panel. The design of the quarter panel gives the illusion of flying buttresses but we're not sure there's an actual hole. Nonetheless, it's an unexpected design cue to see on an SUV.
Mazda isn't saying anything about selling the sedan and SUV outside of China where the two will be manufactured. The Zoom-Zoom company has taken shy steps toward electrification but it knows EVs are inevitable. Although the MX-30 hasn't been a commercial success, to say the least, the Japanese brand is aware it must pursue electrification to survive.

The sedans appear to be similar in size, but we'd argue the Evo has a more daring design with a rakish roofline and a nicer derrière. Nissan is only showing the Evo’s interior, featuring a Tesla-esque minimalist approach by cramming all controls into a large tablet-like display. Unlike on the Model 3, there's still a digital instrument cluster that appears to be a smidge larger than the industry norm.
Despite carrying the Evo name that recalls performance sedans, it's a car ""perfect for weekend getaways and creating special moments for the whole family,"" per Nissan. The two models will fight in a crowded market considering automakers active in China are still offering plenty of sedans across multiple segments. The new Volkswagen Passat Pro is a relevant example since no other market gets the sedan.
Of course, Nissan couldn't miss the opportunity to show a couple of SUVs as well at the Auto China show. The electric Epic and plug-in hybrid Era follow the same design language as the two sedans and are planned to hit the market within the next three years. The Epic has bidirectional charging while the Era gets air suspension, zero-gravity seats, and four-wheel drive.

Lamborghini Urus Plug-In Hybrid Keeps the V-8 and Adds More Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/717143/lamborghini-urus-se-phev-details/,"The Lamborghini Urus SE gets a transmission-mounted electric motor that, combined with the twin-turbo V-8, delivers 789 horsepower.",12/25/2024 8:53,"Leave it to Lamborghini to make a plug-in hybrid SUV exciting. The new Urus SE is an electrified version of the company's best-selling model, now with more power and speed. Although a PHEV setup typically implies a downsized engine, that's not the case here. The twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is sticking around, supplemented by an electric motor.
Housed within the eight-speed automatic transmission, the e-motor produces 189 horsepower and 356 pound-feet of torque. The gasoline engine is rated at a substantial 612 hp and 590 lb-ft. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 789 hp at 6,000 rpm and a mountain-moving 701 lb-ft from 1,750 rpm.
Compared to the Urus S, the new SE is 0.1 seconds quicker to 62 mph, completing the task in 3.4 seconds. It's worth noting the Performante remains the quickest of the Urus range, at 3.3 seconds. This new raging bull reaches 124 mph in 11.4 seconds, or 1.1 second before the gas-only version, and even 0.1 seconds before the spicy Urus Performante. Flat out, it can do 194 mph, making it a tiny bit faster than both V-8-only flavors.
The Urus SE comes with a 25.7-kWh lithium-ion battery mounted below the cargo floor, good for over 37 miles of pure electric range. Driven in EV mode, the SUV tops out at 81 mph. After that, the V-8 automatically kicks in. Lamborghini goes as far as to say emissions are down by 80 percent compared to the pure ICE model.
With the plug-in hybrid, Lamborghini takes the opportunity to give the SUV a nip and tuck. Those updated matrix LED headlights now have a daytime running light signature that takes after a bull's tail, or so we're told. There are some discreet tweaks to the front section with design elements derived from the Revuelto supercar. The rear apparently takes after the Gallardo, and increases downforce by 35 percent compared to the Urus S.
Lambo will sell the electrified SUV with new 23-inch wheels, over 100 body color options, and 47 interior themes. If none of them tickle your fancy, there's also the Ad Personam program for one-off builds ... provided your bank account can handle it. The Urus SE comes with a pair of 12.3-inch screens and four new selectable modes: EV Drive, Hybrid, Performance, and Recharge. These are on top of the usual Strada, Sport, Corsa, Neve, Sabbia, and Terra.
We're wondering whether a similar V-8 PHEV setup is also planned for the Huracan replacement coming later this year. We already know Lamborghini is retiring the V-10, with plans to downsize going forward.
As for the Urus, Lamborghini has already confirmed the second-generation model will be strictly an EV when it launches in 2029. So if you want a gas-powered exotic SUV from the legendary Italian brand, get your order in now.

The Range Rover Electric Sure Looks Like the Gas Model,https://www.motor1.com/news/717046/range-rover-electric-first-images/,The first revealing images of the Range Rover EV show it's a spitting image of the ICE model.,12/25/2024 8:53,"After half a century of gas-guzzlers, Land Rover is turning the Range Rover into an EV. It'll be sold alongside the combustion engines and promises V-8 performance with zero emissions. The new teasers released today show the luxury SUV without camouflage because there's nothing to hide. It looks all but identical to the conventionally powered model.
The electric Mercedes G-Class debuting this week at Auto China 2024 in Beijing will follow the same recipe by largely inheriting the design from its ICE counterpart. Meanwhile, the Range Rover Electric posed for the camera while undergoing cold-weather conditions in the Arctic Circle. It endured temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Land Rover is also testing the silent SUV in the grueling deserts of the Middle East at 122 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's touted as the ""quietest and most refined Range Rover ever created"" and has a newly developed traction control system. The electric luxobarge put the setup to good use on the frozen lakes of Sweden. Compared to a standard traction control setup based on the ABS, the Rangie EV's new hardware can distribute wheel-slip management to each electric drive unit. Doing so reduces the torque reaction time at each wheel from about 100 milliseconds to only 1 millisecond.
There's also some software trickery to minimize ABS intervention and achieve a smooth ride even on slippery surfaces. Land Rover says the large EV will be motivated by a ""new in-house all-electric propulsion system."" The Tata Motors-owned brand doesn't go into details but we're expecting over 500 horsepower since the V-8 has 523 hp from a BMW-sourced 4.4-liter, twin-turbo gas engine. Maybe even more considering the Range Rover SV has 606 hp on tap.
At the very least, a dual-motor setup seems like an educated guess since the Range Rover Electric is certainly going to have four-wheel drive. The electric G-Class officially known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" is expected to feature a quad-motor setup.
Much like the go-anywhere Defender, the electric Range Rover will wade through 33.4 inches of water. It'll be underpinned by the same Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA) used by the regular SUV with combustion engines and is going to feature an 800-volt architecture for fast-charging capabilities.
The upcoming SUV will be JLR's second electric model, following the Jaguar I-Pace launched back in 2018. While the smaller EV is assembled by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, the Range Rover Electric will be manufactured at home in Solihull, UK.
The ICE-less Rangie will be a stepping stone to JLR's goal of achieving zero tailpipe emissions by 2036. Jaguar will be the first to go purely electric in the coming years.

The Mercedes-AMG GT Hybrid Has 9 Miles Of Electric Range on Purpose,https://www.motor1.com/news/716970/mercedes-amg-gt63s-e-performance-range/,The 816-horsepower hybrid's battery is intentionally compromised to offer little energy.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Range is almost everything when it comes to electric vehicles. It's surprising, then, to hear that a lot of hybrid cars, even plug-ins, offer very little all-electric driving range. In the case of fast hybrids like the elegantly-named Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance Coupe, this is an intentional decision. Its nine miles of electric range is more or less just a nice plus.
The new two-door performance offering from AMG has a battery because it's a good match for a high-performance combustion drivetrain. The car's 400-volt hybrid system consists of 560 individual cells optimized to offer high charge and discharge rates, as opposed to a massive amount of energy. Its 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack can discharge up to 204 horsepower (150 kilowatts) in a burst. That's more power than the outgoing Chevy Bolt, despite having a pack that's less than 1/10th the size. It can also absorb 134 horsepower (100 kilowatts) from the wheels, which is twice as fast as the Bolt could charge from a plug.
Battery cell and pack design is all about compromise. Factors like power density, energy density, cycle life, cost, and more have to be balanced to produce the right solution for the car in question. A low-power EV like a Fiat 500e is optimized to provide maximum range at the cost of output power. Its 42.0-kWh battery pack can provide just 117 hp (86 kW), but it can go 149 miles on a charge. The Corvette E-Ray, on the opposite end of the spectrum, has a small pack; just 1.1 kWh is usable. Despite this, it can regenerate more power under braking than the Fiat can put to the ground in anger. The E-Ray's battery is capacitor-like and power-dense, not energy-dense.
The AMG's hybrid system is the same way. It's a compliment to the existing combustion drivetrain, increasing both performance and efficiency. Keep in mind, the new 816 hp Mercedes in question emits just 188 g/km of CO2, which is the same as a 382 hp BMW M340i xDrive.
So while kilowatt-hours and range might be the headline figures for BEVs and PHEVs, it's far from the entire story. The world of hybrid cars especially is complicated by the realities of higher cycle life requirements and other constraints that make designing their batteries an interesting challenge. That challenge should be appreciated—it's a very interesting one—and not just dismissed as a small amount of range in cars that should always have more.

The New MG Electric Hypercar Hits 62 MPH in 1.9 Seconds,https://www.motor1.com/news/716915/mg-exe-181-concept-debut/,The concept car has an ultra-low drag coefficient of just 0.181.,12/25/2024 8:53,"With the 2024 Auto China show starting later this week, we're in for variety of attention-grabbing concept cars. MG will be in Beijing to showcase the EXE181 concept, an electric hypercar with a single-seat moncoque design. Sitting extremely to the ground, the striking EV looks like one of those Vision Gran Turismo cars.
The teardrop shape contributes to a remarkably low drag coefficient of only 0.181, which is better than the Volkswagen XL1's 0.199 and any other production vehicle. But some concepts were better. The 2022 Mercedes Vision EQXX concept had a Cd of just 0.18, the 2000 General Motors Precept had a drag coefficient of 0.16, and we can't forget about the 1954 Fiat Turbina with a remarkably low 0.14.
Regardless, the new MG EXE181 is a modern-day equivalent of a namesake concept from 1959. The UFO-shaped car before it supposedly had an even lower Cd of 0.12. The ""British"" brand owned by China's SAIC Motor says it's not just one of the most aerodynamic cars out there, but also among the quickest. It needs only 1.9 seconds to reach 62 mph from a standstill.
The Lucid Air Sapphire recently did it in 1.77 seconds, albeit to 60 mph rather than 62 mph and with a one-foot rollout. Last year, the Rimac Nevera took 1.74 seconds to get the job done. Elon Musk promises the new Roadster can reach 60 mph in less than a second but we're honestly finding that hard to believe.
As for top speed, MG doesn't say, but it does mention the EXE181 ""defies the land speed record."" The original concept from the late 1950s managed to reach 254.91 mph with American racing driver Phill Hill behind the wheel.
The extremely tight interior with a center-mounted seat and a racing harness is just as futuristic while reminding us of the single-seat Lamborghini Egoista. The new EXE181 has been envisioned with a yoke incorporating a large screen suggesting the car has four electric motors. Although MG is tight-lipped on other technical specifications, we can safely assume all-wheel drive and a combined output of well over 1,000 horsepower.
The chances of seeing a production version are likely slim to none since this looks more like a spectacular one-off affair to grab the headlines, which it has succeeded.

The 805-HP AMG GT63 S E Performance Is The Quickest Mercedes Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/716809/mercedes-amg-gt-63s-eperformance-debut/,The GT63 S E Performance is the quickest-accelerating production vehicle Mercedes-AMG has ever built.,12/25/2024 8:53,"You knew it was coming. For those who prefer their insane Mercedes-Benz performance cars wearing sleek two-door clothing, you have a new toy. The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door coupe is here, and all indications suggest it was worth the wait.
Those familiar with Mercedes-AMG know E Performance is the company's name for hybrid power. You get 805 combined horsepower in the new GT flagship, courtesy of the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 at the front and an electric motor at the back. The gas burner alone accounts for 603 hp, but arguably the more impressive number is the combined 1,047 pound-feet of torque. With everything working together, Mercedes says the AMG GT63 S E Performance reaches 60 mph in a supercar-beating 2.7 seconds. The new-generation coupe might be bigger with its extra seats, but it's officially the fastest-accelerating AMG production model of them all.
While this is technically a plug-in hybrid, efficiency is not a factor here. The battery capacity is just 6.1 kWh, and Mercedes makes no mention of electric-only range other than to say it will be announced later. Instead, the battery's focus is on performance, and to that end, Mercedes keeps it at an optimal temperature to draw the most power when needed. Charging comes through either a plug or various driver-selectable recuperation settings, including a one-pedal mode similar to an EV.
A nine-speed dual-clutch transmission routes power through Mercedes-AMG's 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system. In normal operation, the electric motor only drives the rear axle, but when slip is detected, power can be routed forward. Rear-axle steering and the AMG Active Ride Control suspension with roll stabilization are standard-issue here, as are carbon ceramic brakes. Six-piston calipers grip 16.5-inch rotors at the front, mounted behind standard-issue 20-inch wheels, while 15-inch rotors with single-piston calipers can be found out back. Optional wheels up to 21 inches are available.
Appearance-wise, you'd be hard-pressed to identify the E Performance version from the standard AMG GT63 unless you get up close. Mercedes adds special badging to the trunk lid, and there's a door hiding a charging port on the rear fascia. Unseen are changes to the active aero system, designed to optimize performance specifically for the hybrid powertrain. In the 2+2 cockpit, it's standard-issue Mercedes-AMG, which means it's not a bad place to be.
Pricing for the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door will be announced closer to its on-sale date in late 2024.

Here's The Kia EV5 GT Before You're Supposed To See It,https://www.motor1.com/news/716702/kia-ev5-gt-photos/,There are some specs to go along with the revealing images.,12/25/2024 8:53,"The Kia Stinger GT is dead. Long live the electric GTs. Following the EV6 GT, there's a new EV5 GT on the way. Although announced last year, it hasn't officially launched. However, revealing images have emerged in China as part of the vehicle's homologation process. The photos were published on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's website where there are also some preliminary technical specifications.
The MIIT site lists the spicy electric crossover as a full-fat EV5 GT rather than a GT-Line. The grainy images make it hard to see whether the badge says GT or GT-Line, but we're betting on the former. According to the specs sheet, it has a front electric motor with a peak output of 215 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. At the rear, the motor is good for another 98 hp and 125 lb-ft.
It's worth noting the continuous output is–as expected–considerably lower: 83 hp and 73 lb-ft at the front axle along with 64 hp and 55 lb-ft at the rear. The all-wheel-drive Kia EV5 GT weighs a hefty 4,916 pounds and rides on 20-inch wheels with 255/45 R20 tires. As for size, it’s 164 inches long, 73.8 inches wide, and 67.5 inches tall. That makes it nearly 21 inches shorter, 0.6 inches narrower, and 6.7 inches taller than the EV6 GT. The 108.2-inch wheelbase is six inches shorter than that of its bigger brother.
As a refresher, the regular EV5 was introduced last October during Kia's inaugural EV Day event in Seoul. The company is considering bringing the EV5 to North America, but a final decision has yet to be announced. It's worth noting the new electric crossover is front-wheel-drive-based rather than having a rear-biased setup as with the EV6 and other Kia/Hyundai/Genesis models riding on the E-GMP platform. It also has a 400-volt electric architecture instead of the superior 800-volt setup that enables lightning-quick charging times.
There's another high-performance electric SUV planned since it's already been over a year since Kia promised an EV9 GT. It's scheduled to come out at the beginning of 2025.

Here's Why The Toyota Camry Is Hybrid Only,https://www.motor1.com/news/716462/2025-toyota-camry-hybrid-only/,"We speak with Mark DeJongh, chief engineer for the 2025 Camry. He tells us why it’s “sedan to the core.”",12/25/2024 8:53,"Perhaps the most important thing about the new Toyota Camry is its hybrid drivetrain. It’s the only one available, with conventional four-cylinder and V-6 options dead for 2025. It’s a big deal, yet for Toyota, a natural step.
“It’s just the right vehicle at the right time,” Mark DeJongh, the Camry’s chief engineer, tells Motor1, “and we really think the customers are going to embrace it. The fuel economy is so great, and we knew with the new [Toyota] Hybrid System 5, we really had an opportunity to tune that drivetrain and get it to where it could be great.”
THS 5 is, naturally, the fifth generation of the Toyota Hybrid System that debuted with the Prius back in 1997. To give a very basic overview, THS centers around two electric motor-generator units (MGUs). MGU1 works as a starter for the engine and a generator for the battery; MGU2 is a larger motor that can drive the wheels either with or without the engine. In all-wheel drive Camrys, these are augmented by an additional electric motor that drives the rear wheels.
Whereas the Prius uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Camry uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder evolved from the previous Camry hybrid. It now makes 184 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque. DeJongh talks a lot about finding efficiencies wherever possible, and for the engine, that resulted in switching from 0W-16 oil to an astonishingly light 0W-8. The Camry also has a slightly smaller lithium-ion battery with just 1.0 kWh of capacity, but it now delivers more power than before. System output for the new Camry is 225 hp. The all-wheel drive Camry develops 232 hp.
The most-efficient model, the LE FWD, sitting on its 16-inch wheels, manages 51 mpg combined. Whereas the least efficient, the XSE AWD returns 44 mpg. It’s a figure we easily beat on our drive route.
DeJongh says that, “[O]nce we decided to go 100-percent hybrid, we almost forgot we were going 100-percent hybrid. It just didn’t become a thing anymore.”
It speaks to where Toyota and its customers are. The Japanese giant didn’t go all-in on EVs, instead pushing hybrid models, and it came at the right time. As backlash to EVs grows, so too does consumer interest in hybrids. Going hybrid is a big step, especially for an important model like the Camry, which is still Toyota’s second-most popular model in the U.S.
Beyond the hybrid system, the new Camry is all about iterative updates.
“It’s Toyota, right?” DeJongh says, “Kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen. Little improvement, little improvement, little improvement.”
There are naturally the expected updates to infotainment and driver-assist systems, but DeJongh and his team worked on improving the ride and handling of the SE and XSE models, and steering and brake-pedal feel across the lineup.
“We do kind of a message when we start, a message out to the engineers and everybody’s who’s going to be working on it,” DeJongh says. “Part of my message was ‘SUVs have taken the place that used to belong to sedans, but we are going to stay true to being a sedan.’ People who go to SUV's, we're not trying to get them back... we're not chasing them; we’re making a true sedan. Actually, our motto was ‘sedan to the core.’”
The idea was to simply make a better Camry. Toyota knows well what defines this sedan, and it’s not deviating from the formula.
“That's a double-edged sword,” DeJohngh tells us. “As an engineer, or somebody who develops cars, you want to do something fun and way out there, but like I said, ‘sedan to the core.’ We’re following what a Camry is and making it much better.”

The New BMW i4 Arrives Next Week,https://www.motor1.com/news/716539/2025-bmw-i4-debut-date/,The BMW Group will bring the new i4 and Mini Aceman to the Auto China show.,12/25/2024 8:53,"With BMW offering such a vast lineup, there's always a new model around the corner. After introducing the updated 4 Series Coupe and Convertible in late January, the i4 will break cover next week. The electric 4er is going to celebrate its world premiere in Beijing at Auto China alongside the Mini Aceman.
BMW only mentions the i4, without the 4 Series Gran Coupe upon which the EV is based. It's unclear whether the model with combustion engines will be there as well. Spy shots of the zero-emission model have revealed redesigned headlights with boomerang-shaped elements inherited from the recently updated two-door 4 Series models. The front bumper will also adopt a fresh, albeit busy look.
It's too soon to say whether the 2025 BMW i4 is getting those cool laser taillights we saw on the 4 Series Coupe/Convertible. The M4 CSL had them first a couple of years ago, and so did the ultra-exclusive 3.0 CSL. They're now trickling down to the lesser 4 Series/M4 models.
Inside, the flat-bottomed steering wheel we saw on the ICE-powered, two-door models could come to the i4 as well. In addition, BMW is likely to transition the EV to its latest infotainment system, the iDrive 8.5. We're also expecting slightly revised central air vents surrounded by contour ambient lighting–as seen on the 2025 4 Series Coupe/Convertible.
Joining the i4 in China will be the Aceman, Mini's first electric-only model. Positioned below the Countryman, the new subcompact crossover is going to be built locally by Spotlight Automotive. It’s a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group and Great Wall Motor. The electric three-door hatch is also made there at a new factory in Zhangjiagang, China. The two EVs will also be assembled at home in Oxford, UK from 2026.
Auto China 2024 starts April 25 with the first press day. However, the BMW Group Night event is scheduled a day before, on April 24.

Jeep's Electric SUVs Could Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/716367/jeep-wagoneer-s-recon-gasoline-engines/,The Wagoneer S and Recon EVs could be joined by ICE models to bolster sales.,12/25/2024 8:53,"From 973,227 vehicles sold in 2018 to 643,000 units in 2023–that's quite the downfall for Jeep. It's suffered five consecutive years of decline. Axing the affordable Renegade and Cherokee certainly didn't help, but new CEO Antonio Filosa has a plan. The Wagoneer S and Recon are coming as electric SUVs. In addition, gasoline versions are apparently being considered as well.
Speaking with Automotive News, Jeep's boss admitted the two future electric SUVs might be joined by conventionally powered derivatives. This would be possible thanks to the STLA Large platform that has already underpinned the new Dodge Charger. It's an EV-centric architecture that can accommodate ICEs as well. The next-generation Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio are getting this hardware, too.
Jeep's head honcho told Automotive News that should opportunities arise for ICE versions, ""we need to grab them or somebody else will."" Since the EV market seems to be cooling down, selling these two models with gas engines at a presumably lower price seems like a no-brainer. It would make sense especially considering the company’s new goal is to achieve one million annual sales in the United States.
Even with gas derivatives of the Wagoneer S and Recon, hitting 1M still seems like an overly ambitious goal at this point. Cheaper vehicles to indirectly replace the Renegade and Cherokee would help bolster volume. Europe's Jeep Avenger might be a solution in the US but it wasn't mentioned during the interview.
Meanwhile, the 600-horsepower Wagoneer S is scheduled to go on sale in the third quarter of the year for a short 2024MY run. With a 0 to 60 mph in less than three and a half seconds, it'll be Jeep quickest vehicle ever. It's getting about 400 miles of range and all-wheel drive with a dual-motor setup. The firm's boss says the large electric SUV can lure in Tesla buyers who ""want something more sophisticated.""
The smaller Recon is coming by year's end and will have its first full year on sale in 2025. Other than the STLA Large platform, technical specifications have not been disclosed, but it should be smaller than the Wagoneer S. Filosa projects Wrangler customers interested in electrified off-roaders will want the Recon.

The 2025 Audi RS E-Tron GT Performance Will Be A New Flagship,https://www.motor1.com/news/716219/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-performance/,Think Porsche Taycan Turbo S but not as hardcore.,12/25/2024 8:53,"Hot on the heels of the 2025 Porsche Taycan's debut, Audi is previewing its version of the updated electric sedan. Much like there's now a Taycan Turbo GT, the Four Rings are putting the finishing touches on a new flagship. It's called the RS E-Tron GT Performance to echo gasoline models such as the RS6 and RS7 Performance versions.
It won’t be as hardcore as the model from Zuffenhausen, much like the current RS E-Tron GT isn't as intense as the Taycan Turbo S. Nevertheless, there will be a power boost over the 637 hp and 612 lb-ft offered by the outgoing range-topper. Audi remains coy on details (this is a teaser after all) but it's sharing images of a camouflaged car with ceramic brakes lurking from behind those aero wheels.
The revamped front and rear motors are unlikely to match the 938-hp grunt of the Taycan Turbo S, let alone the immense 1,019 hp of the fierce Turbo GT. We do know Audi's engineers have made changes not just to the powertrain but also to the battery pack for longer range. For reference, the new Taycan with the Performance Battery Plus has a usable energy content of 98.6 kWh while the base model gets an 83.6-kWh net battery pack.
Charging speed is also up, which isn't a surprise considering the latest Taycan can now take 320 kW instead of 270 kW. Elsewhere, Audi has developed a new suspension system with four individually active dual-valve dampers. This quicker-reacting hardware will be adapted from the new Porsche Panamera. In the Audi, the suspension is tuned for greater comfort compared to the sharper Taycan.
Audi intends to unveil the 2025 E-Tron GT later this year. There will be updates across the range since the lesser models positioned below the RS and RS Performance will be tweaked as well.

Mercedes Stops Testing EQS with 1.0-Liter Range-Extending Engine: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/716214/mercedes-eqs-range-extender-test-stopped/,The tiny two-cylinder gasoline engine served as a range extender.,12/25/2024 8:53,"The EQS is built on a dedicated electric car platform, but Mercedes has been toying around with the idea of throwing in a gas engine. Not to drive the wheels but as a generator to juice up the battery on the fly. A new report claims testing of a prototype has been done with a tiny 1.0-liter turbocharged range extender. However, these trials have allegedly been suspended.
Autocar cites a Mercedes insider claiming the German luxury brand is no longer pursuing range-extending EVs. It's deemed as a ""transitional technology"" that’s expensive to produce and brings only minimal benefits. The EQS allegedly had a two-cylinder version of the ""M254"" four-pot engine with an exhaust system mounted at the front of the car. Power came from a rear-mounted electric motor with 268 hp, drawing its energy from a lithium-ion battery pack installed in the floor.
The front-mounted ICE likely wouldn't have hindered practicality since the EQS doesn't have a frunk anyway. However, adding a combustion engine and a small fuel tank would've added weight to an already heavy car. An EQS 450+ tips the scales at 5,597 pounds while the AMG variant weighs 5,952 pounds.
Pricing would've been another issue. Logic tells us a range-extending EQS would've been more expensive given the extra hardware. The base model already costs six figures, starting at $104,400 and rising to $147,550, before options and the destination charge.
We've reached out to Mercedes for a comment, and we will update this story once we hear back. In the meantime, it's worth noting the company inked a deal with Geely in late 2020 to work on hybrid powertrains. While range-extenders weren't specified, we do know that China's automotive juggernaut has this type of technology in its portfolio. The partnership stipulated that Geely-owned Volvo would also use those engines.
The company carrying the fabled three-pointed star is now channeling its efforts toward regular battery-powered EVs. The recently launched 2025 EQS is already a good cure for range anxiety since the enlarged battery (from 108.4 to 118 kWh) enables a maximum WLTP range of 511 miles.
EPA has not rated the revised model, but the old one did up to 352 miles on a single charge. WLTP is generally more optimistic than EPA, so don't expect America's EQS to have the same high rating as the equivalent European model.

Hyundai's New EVs Were Caught Testing in the US,https://www.motor1.com/news/716061/hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt-video/,The Ioniq 5 XRT and Ioniq 9 three-row should debut later this year.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Hyundai’s electric onslaught is in full swing. With the Ioniq 5 recently getting a nip and tuck, the Korean brand is extending its lineup with a rugged-looking XRT trim. It's been spotted in the United States where the larger Ioniq 9 is under final testing as well. The latter is a three-row SUV, which apparently won't be called Ioniq 7 as originally intended.
The Ioniq 5 won't be Hyundai's first model to get the XRT treatment, but the trim level will make its debut on an EV. Already available for Santa Cruz, Tucson, Santa Fe, and Palisade, the XRT is essentially an appearance package. Don't expect real off-road upgrades since it'll mostly be about black accents, new wheels, and possibly those chunky tires as well. We wouldn't hold our breath for a lifted suspension or any other mechanical upgrades for that matter.
The Ioniq 5 should arrive for the 2025 model year alongside the already available high-performance N model. Logic tells us the US-spec variant will inherit the updates we saw on the global model, which also spawned an all-show-without-extra-go N Line. Hyundai tweaked the bumpers and grille, along with adding a rear wiper and a few more buttons inside.
The Ioniq 9 will essentially be Hyundai’s equivalent of the Kia EV9, with room for six passengers. Speaking of how many people it can seat, the Concept Seven introduced in November 2021 was a preview of the brand’s biggest electric vehicle to date. The name change will leave room for a smaller Ioniq 7 that could arrive further down the line.
While the concept (pictured below) did away with B pillars, the subsequent production model will add them back. In addition, the sliding rear doors will make way for a conventional setup. The most striking angle of the Concept Seven was its rear with a massive glass tailgate but that seems to be going away as well. The cutout in the camouflage for the license plate indicates the glass no longer extends all the way down.
How big is it? Well, the Kia EV9 stretches 197.2 inches long. Hyundai didn't reveal the Concept Seven's overall length, but it did say it had a massive wheelbase of 126 inches. That's a full four inches longer than the distance between the EV9's axles. It should translate into an even more spacious cabin, especially for third-row occupants. Looking at the prototype's profile, we notice the roofline gently slopes toward the rear whereas on the Kia it’s pretty much flat. The arched-back silhouette could eat into headroom and cargo volume.
Both the Ioniq 5 XRT and Ioniq 9 are expected to premiere later this year. Automotive News reports US sales of the three-row SUV won't start until mid-2025.

Rivian R1X: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/715808/rivian-r1x-debut-horsepower-details/,Rivian could have a real Raptor fighter in the new R1X.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Rivian recently released two new models: The R2 and the R3. Part of that launch included the surprise debut of the automaker's first performance EV, the R3X. It's essentially a rugged version of the R3, with a slight suspension lift, knobby tires, and a few orange accents.
But that ""X"" moniker could make its way to other models, including the R1 range. A recent trademark filing suggests more jacked-up Rivians are in the works. The company filed for the R1X trademark in 2021, but wasn't published until late last year. Companies trademark names they'll never use all the time, but now that Rivian has the R3X, the R1X seems like a genuine possibility.
Although there aren't specifics on exactly how capable the Rivian R1X could be, we expect it to be able to keep up with the likes of the GMC Hummer EV on the trail, and maybe even the Ford F-150 Raptor. Here's what we know.
All rugged performance models need the right look, naturally. The R1X would have unique fascias and new bumper treatments to improve its off-road capability. Rivian might have already teased what such a model could look like with its bedside storage patent.
The Rivian shown in the filing has an aggressive new face, rugged rockers, and a chunkier bumper that would significantly improve its approach angle. The patent fails to show most of the truck's rear, but we expect a similarly upgraded bumper at the back for all-around capability.
The R3X also debuted with orange accents on the mirror caps, tow hooks, and bumpers, and a teal exterior, which could be hallmarks of Rivian's performance EVs and find their way onto the R1X. The accent color should also carry over to the cabin. The new model could also include the unique bedside storage system Rivian patented last year.
Our rendering artist brought the rugged R1X to life using cues from the R3X and the original patent images.
The R1S SUV and R1T pickup both have dual- and quad-motor setups, but the smaller R3X debuted with a tri-motor layout. That could be a limitation of the R3's smaller size, but Rivian didn't provide any details about the R3X's powertrain configuration.
It's unclear whether that tri-motor configuration could carry over to the larger R1, but a quad-motor setup seems like the likeliest option for a rugged R1X. If Rivian wants it to go off-road, a motor at each wheel with the right software would provide the greatest precision and control.
Rumors say a future performance R1 could have more than 1,000 horsepower. That would make sense given that the R1T has up to 835 hp on the Performance trim.
If the R1X is part of a new trim family, it will probably take after the R3X. It'll likely get all the required hardware for tackling the trails—a raised ride height, chunkier tires wrapped around bigger wheels, and thicker cladding along the bottom.
That means the electric pickup will be even more capable on the trail. The current R1T already has a decent approach angle of 35.5 degrees and a departure angle 26.4 degrees, with the ability to wade water of up to 43.1 inches. All of those numbers should improve with the X upgrades.
The Rivian R1T starts at $71,700, but costs $90,800 with the dual-motor setup and the largest Max battery. The R1S is even more expensive at $76,700 to start, and $95,800 for the dual-motor Max model.
A high-performance version like the R1X would easily push past the $100,000 mark. Assuming the quad-motor layout comes standard—which costs $88,800 on the R1T—the off-road upgrades and updated interior would make this a pretty pricey proposition.
But that's not outrageous for this type of vehicle. The GMC Hummer EV pickup starts at $99,340 for 2024 and the gas-powered Ford F-150 Raptor is $80,325 before options.
Rivian has quite a lot on its plate as it prepares to launch the R2 and, eventually, the R3. The R2 is smaller and more affordable than the R1S, and should be Rivian’s first mainstream model. It goes on sale in 2026.
But there are rumors that Rivian could launch an updated R1 series sometime this year. If that happens, it would be an opportune time to expand the R1 lineup with an X off-road variant. While Rivian will allegedly focus on improving the efficiency of its core lineup, a high-performance model with 1,000 horsepower is rumored in 2024, which could very well be the R1X.

My Quad-Motor Electric Go-Kart Finally Works,https://www.motor1.com/features/715524/quad-motor-electric-go-kart/,We’re gonna need a better battery.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Electric go-karts aren’t uncommon, but I’ve personally never seen a go-kart with an electric motor on each wheel. If you read the last edition of this series, you’ll know my attempt at cheap kart suspension didn’t work. This time, I fix that. I also get this machine moving for the first time under its own power. Spoiler alert: It’s a monster.
I fixed the suspension by getting rid of it. Once again Oshcut, this project’s sponsor, came to the rescue. I modeled up some tubes in CAD which effectively kept the wheels in their original position but mounted them directly to the chassis. I uploaded the files to their site, selected the material, and ordered them. A few days later they were at my doorstep, ready to be installed on the kart. The biggest pain of the entire process was removing the old suspension. Who designed that junk anyway?
The fact that Oshcut offers lasered tubes now is a huge deal. They’re the only company that does it among the handful of businesses with instant-quoted laser-cut/CNC parts. I used laser-cut tubes on the Motocompacto project, and now this one. It will not be the last time you see them. They’re truly a game-changer.
Anyway, my parts were exactly as I specified in CAD, so I installed them with ease. The next thing for me to do was assemble the new front steering system. As you saw last time, my old steering was too weak. This time I doubled the thickness of the tie rods and added some beef to the actual uprights and their mounting positions as well. It seems very strong now, probably more rigid than it needs to be. These bent sheet metal parts are also from Oshcut. Some of them even have threads on them, which you can specify during the upload process on their site.
Finally, I bolted the motors up. The rears went on without much fuss. The fronts were different. I wanted to use a 2-by-3-inch aluminum tube for the rear of this kart because the stub axles off the hub motors would be well supported. It’s also cheaper on Oshcut to get four of the same part, so I used identical tubes on the front. Because of the extra width of the steering system, the front axle is wider than the rear axle. I could accommodate for this with another set of tubes on the back but I just don’t think it’s worth the hassle. This thing is already big enough.
Now it’s time to discuss the electric drivetrain, which is the cool part.
All power electronics have ratings. They can take X amount of power continuously for the rest of time, or Y amount of power for a shorter time. Y is known as the burst rating. It’s a high level of output that cannot be sustained forever but will make you smile. Battery and inverter manufacturers will often state a burst rating, but motor manufacturers will not, for whatever reason.
My hub motors are each rated for 2.5 kilowatts of continuous output. That’s 3.35 horsepower; 52 amps at 48 volts. The voltage will not change considerably as I run the kart, going down a little when I ask for a lot of power–a phenomenon known as voltage sag–and gradually as the pack discharges. Adjusting the current is where the magic happens.
In my experience, hub motors can take about twice their rated current for a short run. Do the math and with four motors that means a potential peak of 20 kW, or 26.8 hp. That’s about as much as a Citroen 2CV.
You run into problems when you desire this much power, though. Even my 2-kilowatt-hour module swiped from an Audi Q5 PHEV cannot provide the 400 amps of current necessary to reach the peak output of this quad motor setup. In fact, it probably can’t even provide the 200 amps necessary to get the peak power out of a rear-wheel-drive setup, which is how I have the kart configured now.
Even without all of the power possible, this thing is fast, though. I’m currently limited to doing short pulls in my driveway, but I can already tell, not only how much torque it has, but also how fast it wants to go. Each motor is only set to 60A and it’s already quick. I really need to find somewhere to stretch this thing’s legs. I can tell the kingpin angle cooked into the steering gives it some semblance of feel, sort of like a car. The entire thing just feels complex, powerful, and massive.
Indeed, it weighs 177 pounds according to my heavy-duty postal scale. Each motor weighs 12.5 pounds for a total of 50 pounds. The battery weighs roughly 30 pounds, which means more than half of the kart’s weight is just drivetrain. The chassis could definitely be lighter—I had to use T-slot extrusions for the main rails because I designed it before Oshcut offered tube cutting. But once there’s a driver on this thing, it wouldn’t save a huge percentage.
Despite this excessive weight, the entire driving experience is still nothing short of thrilling. For the first time I’ve created a vehicle that’s similar in weight to me, and it’s tough to wrap my head around the physics of something like that. The complexity of everything going on is tantalizing. This is not a car, not even close, but even without suspension, I get car-like cues from it. It’s very satisfying.
All of this is a big reason why I don’t want to add more battery to solve my lack of power. I like the current state of the thing’s dynamics and I don’t want additional weight. I’m instead going to change chemistries. That will be the topic of the next edition of this series: Unlocking all of the power of the RWD configuration. Then, once I can put together the AWD battery, we’ll really be entering the danger zone.

Porsche's Skunkworks Built the Taycan Turbo GT,https://www.motor1.com/news/715238/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-skunkworks-development/,Only a handful at Porsche knew about this car’s development. We learned what makes it remarkable.,12/25/2024 8:54,"A few years ago, Stefan Weckbach, then the chief engineer for the Porsche Taycan, built a weird prototype.
""He came up to me with this normal-looking Taycan with two bucket seats and more power,” Porsche test driver Lars Kern told Motor1 at the car’s Spain launch. ""He was like ‘Can you drive it?’ I was looking at the tires and they were Pirelli Corsas from the Panamera. I was like ‘Okay, seems good,’ And we just drove around in Weissach. There wasn’t even a number plate on it and the thing was flying.”
Kern approved. Weckbach’s successor, Kevin Giek, revived it some time later. The brief was essentially to build the ultimate EV, and no idea was too silly. It was to be a real skunkworks effort. The development team was small, and they answered only to Giek and Porsche’s board—no middle-management, no complex approvals process, almost unprecedented freedom to build.
The Turbo GT features a number of tweaks compared to the Taycan Turbo S. A new silicon-carbide inverter for the rear motor boosts total output to 1,092 horsepower when using launch control (1,019 hp with Attack Mode enabled, and 777 hp at all other times). The engineers saved a bit of weight by ditching luxuries like a power-opening charge door and soft-close passenger doors.
In the case of the Weissach-Package car, Porsche axed back seats entirely. Both the standard and Weissach Package car get a unique aero treatment, with the latter gaining a fixed rear wing. There’s unique 21-inch forged wheels, and the standard tires are Pirelli’s new P-Zero R, while the ultra-grippy Trofeo RS is optional. Also standard is Porsche Active Ride, the automaker’s brilliant active-suspension system, which all but eliminates pitch, roll, and dive (the system doesn’t compensate for tire deflection).
Extreme measures like the rear-seat delete or the addition of bespoke Trofeo RS tires wouldn’t happen if the Turbo GT was developed like a normal Porsche model.
“It’s a little bit crazy,” says Christian Müller, the Turbo GT’s chief engineer. “At the beginning, we were talking about ‘Okay, let’s take out this, and this, and this, and this. But it felt good to go in a radical way….you have to go one step further than the others.”
“It was all the little ideas and little tweaks which made the cars so special,” Kern tells us. “I mean everybody was allowed to bring up an idea and it all went through Christian to Kevin, and he was like ‘Yeah. Whatever makes this faster, we’ve got to fuckin’ do it.’”
Müller says that the Turbo GT isn’t simply a response to Tesla showing up at the Nürburgring—a Model S Plaid with the optional Track Package ran a 7:25.231 in 2023, besting the Taycan Turbo S’s 7:33.35 in 2021. But Müller conceded the Nordschleife is like Porsche’s “living room.” The company takes Nürburgring lap times very seriously, so surely it wanted to take the crown from Tesla. And indeed, with Kern’s 7:07.55, the Turbo GT is not only the fastest electric sedan at the Nürburgring, but the fastest sedan period. It’s just two-ish seconds slower than the fastest EV to ever lap the track, the Rimac Nevera hypercar.
What’s perhaps most remarkable is that for all its speed, the Turbo GT is approachable and friendly. Fun, even. In other words, not just a lap-time machine.
“It’s not just one thing… we always try to get a good package that makes the car fast and rounded,” Kern said. “You’re not buying the battery or the suspension,” he added. “You’re buying the whole car. You don’t care how we did it, you just want it to be done as well as possible.”

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Will Race at Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/715558/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-pikes-peak/,The hot EV will lose the rear seats in exchange for a roll cage.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Hyundai wants to show off the Ioniq 5 N's performance chops by bringing four examples of the hot EV to this year's Pikes Peak. The 102th running of the hill climb event takes place June 23 and will feature two production-spec vehicles along with a couple of modified cars. The standard ones won't be truly stock either since some tweaks will be made inside.
Going after the electric production SUV/crossover record, the two Ioniq 5 Ns won't have rear seats. Not because Hyundai wants to make the vehicles lighter but safer by adding a roll cage in the back. In addition, the driver's seat is replaced by a Recaro Pro Racer SPA Hans seat with a six-point Sabelt racing harness compatible with HANS (head and neck support). In case something goes awry, there's going to be a fire suppression system.
Other than these modifications, the Ioniq 5 N will be completely stock. It'll carry over the dual-motor setup from the road-going model, complete with up to 641 horsepower when overboost is active. In regular mode, the total system output is still a massive 601 hp. Hyundai touts a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.25 seconds with launch control and the extra temporary power. Flat out, top speed is electronically capped at 162 mph.
Eleven-time PPIHC winner Paul Dallenbach will hunt for records in one of the two ""stock"" Ioniq 5 Ns. The other one will be driven by rookie Ron Zaras, a former Hoonigan executive. As for the two modified vehicles, these will be piloted by WRC driver Dani Sordo and four-time overall winner and King of the Mountain title holder at Pikes Peak Robin Shute. The two will perform a test ahead of the grueling 24 Hours of Nürburgring set for May 30.
Hyundai is already evaluating the Ioniq 5 N at Pikes Peak, but the speedy EV will adopt an N livery instead of this red finish for the actual race in Colorado. The four vehicles are going to tackle the 12.42-mile course with no fewer than 156 turns. All drivers will go through an elevation gain of 4,725 feet, crossing the finish line at 14,115 feet above sea level.
The outright record at Pikes Peak belongs to Romain Dumas in the Volkswagen I.D. R with a time of 7 minutes and 57.148 seconds established in 2018. It's safe to assume the Ioniq 5 N won't get anywhere close since the VW was a purpose-built electric race car.

The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Demolishes the Track,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/715239/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-review/,"We lapped Porsche’s 1,000-plus-horsepower EV. It’s a friendly beast.",12/25/2024 8:54,"I'm too narrow into Circuto Monteblanco's turn two. Lars Kern, Porsche’s factory development-driver ace in the car leading me around the track, pulls away. No matter, though. Tug at the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT’s right-hand steering-wheel paddle and you unlock Attack Mode, which gives you 1,019 horsepower for 10 seconds. Get on throttle quickly, and the car scrambles out of the corner with authority, vaporizing my mistake.
It’s a monster.
The Turbo GT is the product of ""what if?"" Specifically, ""What if we made a track car out of an electric sedan?"" A genuine skunkworks project, a small team within Porsche developed the car. The team answered only to the board, not middle management. The quickest four-door in the world—electric or not—resulted.
We turned a handful of laps at Circuito Monteblanco outside Seville, Spain, on the launch for the recently facelifted Taycan. It was eye opening.
Based on the Turbo S, the Turbo GT gets a new silicon-carbide inverter for the rear motor that pushes total power output up to 1,019 hp during launch control and for 10 seconds in what Porsche calls “Attack Mode,” and in all other situations, you get 777 hp.
That power pairs to revised aerodynamics including a fixed rear wing on the Turbo GT model, wider wheels and tires, a specific tune for the standard active-suspension system, and some weight-savings measures. Nothing too extreme, well maybe except for the rear-seat delete with the Weissach Package. Even the power figure, though enormous, isn’t that much greater than the Turbo S’s. But these tweaks adds up to a very different electric sport sedan.
Even knowing chassis electronics have made ultra-high-horsepower cars so approachable, the Taycan Turbo GT intimidates. It’s still a 1,000-plus-horsepower car that weighs close to 5,000 pounds in its lightest form. I didn’t pay much attention in physics, but I do know that force is equal to mass times acceleration, and this has a lot of M and A.
Yet, the Turbo GT is shockingly approachable. For something designed to set crazy fast lap times, it’s incredibly welcoming and talkative. You quickly get a sense of the grip level available, which is gargantuan. The Turbo GT comes with the new Pirelli P-Zero R tires standard, and while these tires manage the huge power and weight well, the optional Trofeo RS really make the car come alive. Turn-in grip is absurd. You turn the wheel and think you’re at the limit, but there’s always more available. And breathe off the throttle mid corner and the car rotates beautifully. It’s so responsive.
On either tire, the Turbo GT feels hundreds, if not a thousand pounds lighter than it is. The standard Porsche Active Ride suspension system is fully active, meaning it can put force into the body via hydraulic motor-pump units connected to each damper. The system runs off the Taycan’s 800-volt battery and is capable of generating enormous force (2,248 pounds) in a very short amount of time. As a result, the Turbo GT has virtually no roll, pitch, or dive. (It doesn’t compensate for tire deflection, so the car does move around, but the body sits perfectly level.)
Clever calibration means this feels more natural than you’d expect, but Active Ride generates immense grip by controlling the loads independently at each corner. The damping is basically perfect, too. Monteblanco has a couple tall curbs and big rumble strips. You can huck a Turbo GT over them at silly speeds and the car just shrugs it off.
If a car is just a battle between horsepower and grip, this battle is evenly matched. Which is astonishing. In the slow corners and chicanes, the Turbo GT rockets forward, with just a hint of how hard the car is working to generate traction; in the high-speed stuff, it feels absolutely stable. Between the massive mechanical and aero grip—the Turbo GT Weissach Package generates a maximum of 485 lbs at its 190-mph top speed—the car feels planted at all times.
Monteblanco’s best corner is a fast uphill right with a compression at the bottom. You need a light brake or a lift, and the corner puts so much load through the car. The Turbo GT takes it all no problem. It’s astonishing.
The Turbo GT excels at stopping too, especially when you consider the fact that it’s constantly adjusting the balance of regenerative and friction braking, and dealing with incredible speed and weight.
Oh yeah, speed. Porsche had us stop along the front straight and launch the Turbo GT. From there, Kern says if you ran the full length of the straight, you’d probably be doing around 175 mph braking into turn one. Too fast for an event like this. Yet even stopping more than halfway down the straight and using launch control, you still hit around 120 mph before you have to pull the chute.
Launching the Turbo GT is genuinely disorienting. Porsche says 0-60 mph in 2.1 seconds for the Weissach Pack car, and the first time I did it, my vision went blurry for an alarming amount of time. It takes a little over six seconds to get to 124 mph, which is about as long as it’d take me to get to 60 in my Volkswagen GTI if I decided that I no longer wanted a functioning clutch.
The acceleration and speed are party tricks, but the Turbo GT is much more. It feels entirely at home on a track. The way it generates grip recalls the best stuff I’ve ever driven on a circuit, and it still manages to feel engaging.
“For us as race car drivers, it’s not a negative if the car drives well,” Kern says. “It’s as easy as that. We like a comfortable car as well, a car that’s easy to drive at the limit.”
Downsides? The cool bucket seats you see here aren’t available in America. They’re a little silly in a car like this, but they offer more feedback through the seat of the pants, and, well, the whole car is a little silly, right?
I think the target audience for this is small, though. A $230,000 four-door EV track car is a very specific niche, but I suppose there are always people who want the best version of a thing. And while we didn’t get to drive the Turbo GT on the road, the flexibility of the active suspension should mean it’s no more difficult as an everyday proposition than any other Taycan. Unless you delete the rear seats.

The Electric Mercedes G-Class Is Called G580 With EQ Technology,https://www.motor1.com/news/715396/mercedes-g580-eq-technology/,It debuts at Auto China this month together with several other premieres.,12/25/2024 8:54,"At long last, the electric Mercedes-Benz G-Class finally has a name. Contrary to reports indicating the off-roader would be the first model to drop the EQ branding, the two letters are sticking around. But rather than being called EQG like the concept, the production version will be known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" when it debuts this month at Auto China in Beijing.
Since it's called the ""G580,"" we can safely assume that it has more power than the G550. For the 2025 model year, the regular G-Class loses its V-8 in favor of a mild-hybrid, inline-six engine that makes 443 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. We reckon the electric G is not going to outpunch the AMG G63, which keeps the V-8 packing 577 hp and 627 lb-ft.
The electric G-Class is expected to have four motors—one at each wheel—and a battery capacity estimated at 100.0-kilowatt-hours. That should give it a range of over 200 miles, which isn’t ideal, but not surprising since it'll be a heavy SUV. An optional high-density battery pack benefitting from silicon anode chemistry is due in 2025. We also know it'll have 32-degree approach and 35-degree departure angles, along with 9.8 inches of ground clearance.
The G580 with EQ Technology won't be the first quad-motor EV from Mercedes since that title goes to the SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012. It's going to need all the power it can get considering G brand boss Emmerich Schiller has said it'll weigh less than 7,716 pounds.
An updated EQS will also attend the 2024 Auto China where the luxury brand intends to unveil (takes a deep breath) the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance with a plug-in hybrid V-8 setup. Without going into details, the three-pointed star mentions new show premieres from Maybach and the E-Class lineup will be there as well.
We'll first see the GT63 S E Performance on April 20 during the AMG Brand Night Event in Shanghai during the Chinese F1 weekend while the electric G premieres on April 24. Auto China starts April 25 with the first press day.

Watch Mercedes Drift The Electric G-Class on a Frozen Lake,https://www.motor1.com/news/715123/watch-mercedes-drift-electric-g-class/,We learn a few details about its off-road capability in the process.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Mercedes-Benz promises the forthcoming EQG—also known as the electric G-Class—is a proper off-roader. There's little reason to doubt the claim given that it looks almost exactly like the ICE model. With each wheel getting its own motor, the electric version could be more capable, with the ability to pull off stationary tank turns. Those individual motors are also good for getting comfortably sideways should you come upon a frozen lake in Sweden.
In this new video from Mercedes-Benz, CEO Ola Källenius journeyed to his home country for an electric G evaluation, demonstrating the G-Class's capabilities at a winter testing center set up by the company. There, he tackles a slalom and skidpad, where the SUV seems composed, despite all the snow and ice.
The real action comes on the skidpad, where Källenius explains how the individual motors can vector the EQG to keep it under control when slip is detected. Even when goading it into significant oversteer, things appear calm in the cockpit. After an acceleration test on ice (which Mercedes says takes ""just a few seconds"") Källenius jumps into more sideways fun. It's unclear if stability systems are adjusted or even disabled for this portion of the video, but the big G has no problem sustaining plenty of opposite lock.
The video concludes with a short trail ride off the lake, where we get a few technical teasers. The electric G-Class has a 32-degree approach angle and a 35-degree departure angle, slightly better than the current model. There's 9.8 inches of ground clearance too, also a few tenths better versus the ICE version.
It's been a minute since Mercedes first floated the electric G-Class with the EQG concept. Thankfully the production model will debut this year, though a specific timeframe hasn't been shared. Until then, expect a few more teasers leading up to the official reveal.

Porsche Working on Next-Generation Taycan with Greater Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/715027/porsche-working-second-generation-taycan/,Solid-state batteries might not be ready in time for the second-gen model.,12/25/2024 8:54,"There's no such thing as pausing development. Although it's been only a couple of months since Porsche updated the Taycan, work is already underway on the second-generation model. Despite giving the current sports EV substantial tweaks for its mid-cycle revision, more upgrades are planned for the next iteration.
The Taycan Manager of Charging and Energy Systems, Sarah Razavi, confirmed in an interview with Australian magazine CarSales that a new Taycan is already being developed. She admitted the J1 platform that also underpins the Audi E-Tron GT has been pushed to the maximum and that Porsche needs to come up with something else. Although not specified, perhaps the next-gen car will switch to the already announced SSP Sport platform that will serve as the basis for a large three-row electric SUV.
""Next generation? Yes, obviously, once we publish one model, we already [start] work on the next one, so we are currently creating ideas [and asking] what should we improve with the next generation. I think we did a great job to really push and squeeze every bit out of the current platform. We're probably going to see an evolution of the platform.""
Razavi admitted the J1 architecture ""definitely has some limitations"" and that the goal for a follow-up to today's Taycan will be to achieve greater range. Meanwhile, the revised model introduced in February promises up to 421 miles of WLTP range, a jump of 109 miles or 35 percent. EPA figures are not out yet. Asked if solid-state batteries are planned, Taycan product specialist Mayk Wienkötter suggested the technology might not be ready in time:
""We've been working on it, of course, but giving a timeframe when it's ready? It's way too early, too early [to confirm]. It's not ready in one or two years. It's coming but it will take time.""
Porsche could easily cram in a bigger battery but that increases the weight of an already heavy EV. Razavi mentioned that the engineers need to ""find the sweet spot"" so as not to overburden the Taycan but also avoid giving owners range anxiety.
With a second-generation Taycan confirmed, you're probably wondering where does that leave the Panamera. An Autocar report from September 2022 alleged the latter will evolve into a larger EV positioned above the Taycan while using the same SSP Sport platform. It's too soon to know for sure but an electric Panamera might not necessarily spell the end of the gasoline model.
After all, the new Macan EV will peacefully coexist with the ICE model for several years, and so will the electric and gas Boxster and Cayman sports cars. That said, the first-gen crossover and the current 718 models have been phased out in the European Union due to stricter cybersecurity regulations.

Give Performance EVs A Chance,https://www.motor1.com/features/714562/give-performance-evs-a-chance/,"Who knows, you might like 'em.",12/25/2024 8:54,"I see you, Instagram commenters. Whenever I read something on a Motor1 post like, ""Abomination,"" and ""Nobody wants this,"" it makes me smirk—especially when we're talking about the quickest and most powerful Porsche ever built. My favorite line: ""Even if vegan cars have 2,000 horsepower they are still trash."" Chef's kiss.
It's fair to be skeptical of electric vehicles, especially since the push for mass electrification has dragged on for years. And most certainly, those are fair criticisms to lob at appliances like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Nissan Ariya—electric crossovers that truly do nothing to separate themselves from the swathes of better gas alternatives, other than ""battery.""
But when those insults are directed at a 1,092-hp Porsche that gets to 60 mph in 2.1 seconds—what are we even doing here?
Part of the problem comes down to exposure, or lack thereof. It’s easier to say an EV sucks when the only one you've experienced firsthand in is an eight-year-old Nissan Leaf. If someone handed you an iPhone 7 in 2024, you’d say the same thing.
Technology evolves rapidly, and modern EVs have come a long way in a short time. The current market has so many awe-inspiring and soul-stirring electric vehicles that you'd be shocked (pun intended).
Take the Rimac Nevera. Two years ago I spent a glorious 30 minutes behind the wheel of what is still the quickest production car in the world. No, the batteries don’t roar to life like the W-16 in the Chiron, nor does an electric powertrain offer the same delectable character as a 911 GT3’s flat-six at 9,000 rpm. The Rimac does other things spectacularly.
The Nevera launches to 60 quicker than the mind can comprehend. No gas engine in the world delivers the same wallop of torque. And a clever torque vectoring system sends the exact amount of twist to each wheel, adjusting that amount at a rate of 100 times per second, so you can go full speed into a turn and the Nevera knows exactly how much twist you need to maximize exit speeds. Try that in a Bugatti and see what happens.
The Nevera is a technological marvel. It’s the amalgamation of my wildest childhood automotive fantasies come to life. Nineteen hundred horsepower packed into a futuristic design with spaceship sounds pumping from the speakers while you full send it into a corner—it's everything video games promised.
The Porsche Taycan has a lot of those same qualities; Instant acceleration matched with an excellent chassis and a world-class suspension. I rode shotgun in the Taycan Turbo GT for a few laps of Porsche’s Atlanta test track with pro driver Jörg Bergmeister at the wheel. And for a posh four-door that weighs nearly 5,000 pounds, it was one of the most dynamic passenger experiences in recent memory.
Engineering is truly amazing.
And it’s not just the most extreme and unattainable, either. Even on the more affordable side of things, cars like the BMW i4 M50, Polestar 2 Performance, and Kia EV6 GT are ripe with instant torque and mind-bending acceleration. The EV6 GT will get you to 60 miles per hour in nearly 3.0 seconds flat. In a Kia.
Soon the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will go on sale and—given the brand’s track record—it’s bound to be another smash-hit from Hyundai’s N Performance division. That, too, is packed to the gills with power (641 hp) and will get you to 60 in just over 3.0 seconds.
That’s not to say you won’t have to make sacrifices, though. There’s certainly an emotional connection missing. Even the quickest and most powerful EVs are about as feelsome as an iPhone when you’re just driving around town; Batteries and electric motors have very little personality. Bugatti’s W-16 (RIP) feels alive underhood of a Chiron—you can barely tell Rimac’s batteries are even there.
The sound and vibration you get from a real gas engine is missing, obviously. Some companies, like Hyundai, are trying to simulate the noise of a gas engine—and it doesn’t sound half bad on the Ioniq 5 N, to be honest. But it’s still a far cry from the real thing.
And then there’s the big one: No manual transmission. The single-speed gearbox in most EVs is duller than dirt; it virtually does away with the idea of shifting entirely. Some companies like Toyota, to their credit, are trying to figure out how to get manuals in their EVs. But it’ll probably still feel a lot like your little brother playing a video game with the controller unplugged. Disconnected entirely.
Affordability is still an issue too. Of all the cars mentioned above, the Kia EV6 GT is the cheapest—and it still costs $62,975. Prices overall will eventually get cheaper as the initial investments in tooling, manufacturing, and battery technology settle, and electric performance cars (in theory) should get cheaper too. Volkswagen recently tempted us with promises of a $25,000 electric GTI, and there are rumors of other sub-$40,000 performance EVs on the horizon
So no, performance EVs aren’t perfect. At least not yet. Even some of the cars I mentioned here don’t move the needle as much as their gas counterparts do in many respects. But electrification is inevitable, so instead of poo-pooing the idea of performance EVs entirely, it’s worth giving some of them a shot. The experience is different, but there’s still a lot to like.
Go take a ride in a Taycan or borrow a buddy’s EV6 GT—who knows, you might actually enjoy yourself.

"Mercedes-Benz EQS Loses Nearly Half Its Value After One Year, Study Says",https://www.motor1.com/news/714685/mercedes-benz-eqs-loses-nearly-half-value/,"That's a whopping $65,143 on average. Meanwhile, a Kia Rio only loses $21 in the first year of ownership.",12/25/2024 8:54,"It's no secret that new cars take a big hit on value once they leave the dealership lot. Some take bigger hits than others. Then there's the Mercedes-Benz EQS. With sedan, SUV, and AMG trims combined, the luxury EV loses a whopping 48.7 percent of its average new price after just one year of ownership, according to a study published by iSeeCars. That equates to $65,143—essentially the same as writing off an entire E-Class.
It's not the only electric vehicle on iSeeCar's list of fastest-depreciating cars, either. Five of the top ten vehicles in the study are EVs, starting with the Nissan Leaf in second place. It only loses $15,786 on average, but with a considerably lower starting price, we're still talking about a 45 percent drop. Jaguar holds the distinction of having the highest-depreciating combustion vehicle with the F-Pace in third, losing $28,555, or 35.4 percent of its value. Alfa Romeo isn't far behind with the Giulia at 33.4 percent, dropping $16,297 on average. The Kia EV6 nabs fifth 33.3 percent, losing $18,081 on average.
What about vehicles that aren't taking such a financial beating? The study shows lots of love for hybrid vehicles, but it's the plucky Kia Rio that turned our heads. It seems folks in the US still want an inexpensive combustion-powered subcompact, because it only lost $21 on average after one year of use. It's a drop of just 0.1 percent, meaning a lightly used Rio still fetches a nearly-full sticker price. The fact that it was dropped from Kia's lineup for 2024 could be a factor, too.
Saving face for Mercedes is the G-Class, which ranks third on the least-depreciating scale with a 2.3-percent drop, or $4,587 on average. Meanwhile, the Ford Maverick only loses around $1,400 on average. It holds fourth and fifth place here, representing the standard combustion model and the hybrid at 4.1 and 4.4 percent.
The first-place Land Rover Range Rover has the curious distinction of selling 2.8 percent over its new sticker price on average after one year. We suspect this is skewed due to the new 2024 model slowly reaching the market, pushing up demand for used SUVs as impatient buyers get tired of waiting or refuse to pay high dealer markups. The iSeeCars team mentions this theory as well.
The study evaluated over 1.6 million new and used listings from January through March 2024, incorporating 2023 and 2024 model-year vehicles. In this instance, ""used"" equals a vehicle having mileage within 20 percent of 13,476 miles, largely considered average mileage for a year of use. Low-volume niche vehicles were excluded from the research.
It's interesting to see a clear drop in EV prices versus strong residuals for used hybrids. This supports the softening demand for fully electric vehicles we've seen, while hybrids remain desirable choices for many. The study further breaks down new-versus-used vehicles by price brackets and locations in the US, which you can see at the source link below.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup is a Lighter Electric Race Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/714472/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-en1-cup-debut/,It loses substantial weight and adds race car bits over the regular Ioniq 5 N.,12/25/2024 8:54,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is going racing in a dedicated series. It's called the eN1 class and it will consist of sprint races as well as one-on-one knockout races. The new racing series echoes the N1 class featuring the Elantra (Avante in South Korea) and is not limited to a single manufacturer or just one tire vendor.
The first electric N model receives many changes over the road-going car to make it more track friendly. For starters, Hyundai shaved off a lot of fat. While the street-legal Ioniq 5 N weighs up to 4,916 pounds, the eN1 Cup Car sheds nearly 600 pounds. It tips the scales at 4,343 lbs despite getting a full aerodynamic body kit with bulging fenders and a massive rear wing.
The diet was achieved by mounting a fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) hood and polycarbonate windows. It also gets 18-inch forged wheels with slick tires and has a stripped-out cabin with a single bucket seat. Although the Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup Car has been put on a diet, it comes with a lot of hardware not found on the regular model. Hyundai installs a full FIA-compliant roll cage, meaty 18-inch slick tires, an asphyxiation fire layer, and a high-voltage shutoff system.
Other changes over the road-going Ioniq 5 N include an adjustable suspension with two-way dampers, a high-voltage warning indicator, and a charging port relocated at the back. Oddly enough, the race car retains the fake engine noise trickery (N e-Shift) and teams will even be allowed to pick their favorite sounds. The function enabling artificial gear changes (N e-Shift) has also been retained. Battery pre-conditioning is still there, as is the N Grin Boost that unlocks full power for 10 seconds.
The dual motors continue to produce a combined 641 hp as with the road-going Ioniq 5 N from where it has also inherited the 84.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Performance details have not been revealed, but 0 to 60 mph should take around three seconds considering the standard hot electric crossover does the job in 3.25 seconds with the N Grin Boost active.
We'll see the new Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup Car in action for the first time on April 27 during the inaugural round of the 2024 Hyundai N Festival at the Inje Speedium where the eN1 class will have an official practice session. A total of 10 races are set for later this year.

Porsche Explains Why Its Next Electric Hypercar Needs All-Wheel Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/714294/porsche-hypercar-awd-better-efficiency/,"If approved for production, the flagship model will eschew the concept's rear-wheel-drive setup.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Porsche hypercars have been few and far between. The 918 Spyder came out in 2013 while the Carrera GT launched in 2004. Even further back, the 959 debuted in 1986. In 2023, Mission X previewed a potential flagship model from Zuffenhausen. Later this year, a decision will be made whether to put the concept into production. If green-lighted, there's going to be a major hardware change.
When the all-electric Mission X debuted in June 2023 to celebrate Porsche's 75th anniversary, the concept had a rear-wheel-drive layout. However, a subsequent road-legal car would switch to an all-wheel-drive setup. Not to unlock extra performance, but to improve efficiency. As weird as that might sound when talking about a hypercar, it makes sense. An AWD setup would significantly increase energy recovery to put more juice back into the battery and help extend the range.
Speaking with Australian magazine Which Car, Mission X project manager Michael Behr explained why AWD would be adopted: ""It's an electric car and you need a four-wheel-driven car to recuperate a lot of energy [for the battery] to have a bigger range on the Nordschleife, not just for one lap, maybe for three laps.""
That's still an extremely low range considering the track is just under 13 miles long, so three laps would be 39 miles. However, Behr was talking about three laps performed by a driver who knows what they’re doing and can extract every drop of performance from the Mission X. Driven at a regular pace, the electric hypercar would likely have a significantly higher range.
That said, it's obvious Porsche doesn't want to cram in a huge battery to extend range since that would add weight. It would be difficult to install a supersized battery anyway since the concept was only 177.1 inches long, so there would be packaging constraints. Behr mentioned the wheelbase would be altered for a production version compared to the concept, which measured 107.5 inches between the axles.
In the concept, the battery was mounted centrally behind the seats and featured direct oil cooling. Porsche developed the Mission X with a 900-volt system architecture to enable charging speeds about twice as quickly as the pre-facelift Taycan Turbo S. The updated electric sedan now supports 320-kilowatt charging power instead of 270 kilowatts, and can replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes.
During the same interview, Behr suggested the production version is likely to be sold strictly with a left-hand-drive layout to reduce complexity. He added it would have more headroom than the 918 Spyder, enabling drivers to comfortably use a helmet. This will be possible by fitting doors that open upwards and forward in the same vein as on the 917 Le Mans racer, which also had the curved glass extending onto the roof.
Porsche has previously said it will approve the Mission X for production only if it meets certain criteria. It must generate more downforce than the 911 GT3 RS and feature a power-to-weight ratio of 1 to 1. In addition, it must double the charging speed of a Taycan Turbo S. Most importantly, it must set a record for a street-legal production car around the Nürburgring. The title currently belongs to the Mercedes-AMG One with a lap time of 6 minutes and 35.18 seconds.
Porsche holds the outright record around the Green Hell with the track-only 919 Hybrid Evo and an incredible 5:19.55 lap.

That gets you the Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid sedan with a whopping 670 horsepower. However, like other Porsche products, the price tag grows quickly when you start to add options.
The Turbo E-Hybrid packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter hybrid V-8 engine that cranks out 680 pound-feet of torque. The sedan can accelerate to 60 miles per hour with the Sport Chrono Package in 3.0 seconds flat and hit a 196-mph top speed with the summer rubber.
The new E-Hybrid has a bit less power than the previous Turbo S E-Hybrid, down from 690, but Porsche countered the drop with an increase in torque by 45 pound-feet. Its electric motor also has a heavier punch—187 hp vs 134. The battery capacity also increases from 17.9 kilowatt hours to 25.9.
Porsche controls all that power and the car’s 5,200-pound weight with its Porsche Active Ride, a fully active suspension system. This allows Porsche to have great control over the car’s body motions, making it lean into corners like a motorcycle or pitch rearward/forward during braking and acceleration.
You can build your Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid on the configurator now. Porsche lists numerous options that can add nearly $100,000 to the price tag, with our most expensive build reaching $285,205. That, thankfully, includes the $1,995 destination charge.
If the Turbo E-Hybrid has too much money and power, the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid starts at $117,495. The 4S E-Hybrid is $128,795 to start, while Porsche prices the entry-level Panamera at $104,795.

We Tried Unusual Sodium Ion Batteries in Our Motocompacto Type R,https://www.motor1.com/features/713344/sodium-ion-motocompacto-type-r/,"Sodium ion is all the rage now, but what's the deal with the emerging chemistry?",12/25/2024 8:54,"Lithium-ion is all the rage in EVs, but have you heard of sodium-ion batteries? The excitement around this emerging battery chemistry is huge. As with any new energy storage tech, it can be hard to nail down whether it's a legitimate step toward a sustainable future or just hype. Luckily, sodium ion cells have been commercialized quickly, and regular people can buy them in familiar formats.
As we have our hopped-up Motocompacto lying around, we figured we’d try these new cells to see what they're good for. Could they match up to the performance of a lithium-ion pack? The answer is pretty interesting.
To test this idea out, we decided to make our own battery packs that can accept any variety of 18650-type cells. 18650s, named for their diameter of about 18 millimeters and length of 65 millimeters, are one of the most ubiquitous varieties of batteries available. They're powerful little cylinders, and our circuit board-based pack can accept 12 of them wired in series. This will give us more than enough voltage to get our Motocompacto up to respectable speeds.
I designed these packs mostly as an experiment. They consist of 12 separate cell holders connected by very heavy copper traces and all of the components come pre-soldered on. Charging and discharging happens through an XT60-type connector, which is common for this sort of application. I’m not sure if they’re gonna work, but they were reasonably cheap to order to my specifications, so I figured why not give them a shot? Worst case scenario: Something catches on fire.
In order to do a fair comparison between lithium and sodium-ion cells, I bought both. The Sodium cells were easy enough to find; a reseller called Sriko Batteries sells them online in their own custom wrappers. Their exact origin is unknown to me, however they did come with an OK datasheet. I'll go into the specifics of these cells in a moment.
The lithium cells did not come to me so easily. You can easily buy practically new individual cells online—the kids these days call them loosies—from a handful of reputable websites. They just cost a lot of money. People are generally buying them for vapes or flashlights, so getting just two or three at these prices isn't unreasonable. Getting a dozen costs a lot more.
Luckily, one of my favorite battery resellers had a bunch of good-quality cells for sale in bulk. The only issue was they were in existing enclosures. I bought them, removed them from the enclosures, and had my lithium. They're Molicel INR-18650As, a quality cell with a high discharge rate. Molicel, for reference, makes the batteries that power the quickest electric car on earth; the McMurtry Spierling. Very reputable.
Comparing the two cells is relatively straightforward. Battery cell capacity is determined by multiplying its rating in amp-hours by its nominal voltage, which is a midpoint between fully charged and fully discharged. The sodium cells operate between 2.0V and 4.0V with a nominal voltage of 3.0V. They are rated at 1.3Ah each, which means each contains 3.9 watt-hours of energy. It's worth noting that the datasheet says 1.2Ah, while the wrapper says 1.3Ah. I'm feeling optimistic, though.
The lithium cells butcher them badly in terms of capacity and these aren't even the best 18650s you can buy from Molicel. They are 2.5Ah each, operating between 2.0V and 4.2V (although I only discharge them down to 2.8V). Their nominal capacity is 3.6V. This translates into 9Wh each, which is more than double the sodium cells.
So why even buy the sodium cells? It has everything to do with “buy.” Getting a good quality INR-18650A will cost you $4-$6 each if you don't want to get your hands dirty. For our battery pack that would mean a cost, just in cells, of at least $48. I didn't pay that, but if I wanted nice clean units without having to tear apart any plastic enclosures, that's how much it would cost.
The sodium ion cells arrived spotless and charged up, all ready to go. They cost me $1.52 each. This practically makes them disposable, and keep in mind that the company I bought them from is still making money selling them that cheap. This is after they bought them wholesale and re-wrapped all of them. The hype around sodium-ion is about the price and how, with a little improvement, it might be able to challenge lower-end lithium chemistries, like lithium-iron-phosphate. They also just got commercialized in the last few years and they’re already that cheap. Pretty nuts.
Capacity isn't everything when it comes to batteries. Cells have a specific energy, sure, but also specific power, i.e., how much current they can discharge.
The sodium cells max out at around 13A continuous discharge but can provide more than that in a short burst—around 25 amps. The lithium cells can put out 20A or more continuously. In other words, the sodium cells have a comparable power density, which again is respectable considering the price, even if the capacity isn't very good.
Combining all of these cells into a pack gives us the whole story. The lithium pack contains 108Wh of energy and is capable of providing 864W continuously at nominal voltage, which is great. The sodium pack contains less than half the energy; just 46.8Wh. It can put out 468 watts of energy, though. That's around half the power, but again the cells are 1/3 or even 1/4 the price. You could buy twice as many cells and wire them in parallel to get the same battery performance for less cost, albeit with a physically larger and heavier pack. You can extrapolate how this might translate into full-sized EVs.
In terms of what these are like to ride with the different packs, the lithium one is much quicker. The sodium cells can provide stock Motocompacto performance, but as you’ve probably read in earlier installments of our series, that isn’t saying much. The Molicel pack allows for almost double the performance of the stock scooter. The lithium cells can also charge a little faster than the sodium cells, which means we can regen harder. These 18650As don’t even have especially good charging performance, either. With a different cell, we could harvest even more energy under braking.
So what’s the over-under? Well, sodium-ion is mostly cheap. Another thing I didn’t mention is that it has a good cycle life. These lithium Molicel units have a rating of around 500 cycles before they degrade to roughly 80% capacity. That’s the price you pay for big power. The sodium cells can do more like 3,000 cycles before that degradation occurs. I think a sodium-ion cell with more power density—which I know exists—would be good for hybrid cars or grid storage, where their poor energy density in terms of weight and volume isn’t as important. For hybrids, cycle life and power density are key.
In a nutshell, sodium-ion has yet to see its full potential in a transportation context, but the cost-benefit is huge. The whole scooter battery pack cost me just $18.24 in cells. That’s a great deal, especially considering the stock Honda Motocompacto battery costs more than $300. It has 5x the capacity, sure, but an equivalent sodium bank would still be under $100, and there’s plenty of room in the compacto’s body to store batteries.
Aren’t batteries fun? I love batteries.

Volkswagen R Wants to Be an Independent Brand and Launch Hot EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/713819/volkswagen-r-independent-brand/,R is getting a dedicated section at VW's theme park in Wolfsburg.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Volkswagen R started in 2002 with the Golf R32. Then the Passat R sedan/wagon came along in 2008, followed a year later by the Scirocco R, while the Polo R WRC landed in 2013. In recent years, ""R"" has even been used for hot versions of the Arteon and T-Roc, Tiguan, and Touareg SUVs. But in 2024, VW wants R to evolve into an independent brand.
The plan is to open a dedicated Volkswagen R section at the Autostadt theme park in Wolfsburg. If you haven't been there already, it’s a visitor attraction located near the company’s factory, similar in philosophy to the BMW Welt in Munich. Annually, about two million people visit the Autostadt and its multiple pavilions dedicated to VW Group brands, from Skoda and SEAT to Audi and Lamborghini. An R pavilion spanning 1,076 square feet will join them this summer.
Fans of hot VWs will have the opportunity to check out concept cars and limited-run production models. Inevitably, there will be electric performance models on display. VW says the R lineup will gradually evolve in the coming years with amped-up EVs in the works. The process has already started with the Touareg R—complete with a plug-in hybrid V-6 powertrain.
However, there's still life left in the ol' internal combustion engine. The Golf R facelift is coming out this summer but sadly without a manual gearbox. That won't be such a dealbreaker in Europe where the Mk8 was never offered with three pedals but the stick shift will be missed by enthusiasts in the US.
VW’s decision to distance R (originally called Volkswagen Individual GmbH) from the main brand started in 2020 when it became a separate business unit. Elsewhere within the VW Group, SEAT went a step further with its US-bound Cupra spin-off marque by introducing standalone models. Audi Sport is also a separate entity within Audi.
As to what the future entails, VW has said the ninth-gen Golf will be exclusively electric. Will that be the first electric R? Time will tell, but we're likely going to see an electric GTI first. Spicy EVs are already part of the company's portfolio since the GTX models have more power, including even the ID. Buzz GTX minivan.
In the meantime, R is doing better than ever as more than 35,000 cars were produced in 2023, a record for the brand. Since 2002, over 300,000 R-badged vehicles have been sold.

Porsche Caught Testing Electric Boxster with Fake Exhaust,https://www.motor1.com/news/713806/porsche-boxster-electric-spy-video/,It had a large charging port door.,12/25/2024 8:54,"With Porsche killing the 718 in Europe due to cybersecurity regulations, its all-electric successor can't come soon enough. Ahead of its release in 2025, the Boxster EV was spotted cold-weather testing in Scandinavia. Some of these prototypes now have the final headlights and taillights, but that center exhaust tip is definitely fake.
This is a running joke with Porsche; both Taycan prototypes had fake exhaust tips before they debuted. In addition, the Macan EV was also seen with fake exhausts during the testing phase. We won't be surprised if the already confirmed three-row electric SUV and Cayenne EV will adopt a similar setup once testing starts.
But we can't help but notice the large charging port door in the center of the rear bumper. EV owners usually juice up the batteries from one of the car's sides, but that won't be the case with the future Boxster. It's also different from what Porsche is using considering the Taycan has dual charging ports on the front fenders while the Macan has the pair on the rear fenders. We can't tell because the prototypes are still cleverly camouflaged but it looks as though the next-gen 718 will only have one charging port.
Likely carrying the ""983"" internal codename, the next-gen 718 could retain the ""Boxster"" moniker despite doing away with the boxer engine. That wouldn't be surprising—the Taycan Turbo doesn't have a turbocharger. These are popular nameplates Porsche doesn't want to retire.
The new electric sports car will retain the fabric roof, two-seat layout, and front trunk, but it will be a different model underneath the skin. It could borrow bits and pieces from the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) hardware co-developed by Porsche with Audi. We're expecting rear- and all-wheel-drive versions with single- and dual-motor setups, respectively. The Boxster is likely to come out first, with the Cayman coupe to follow shortly after that.
The new electric-only Macan has a lithium-ion battery pack with a usable capacity of 95.0 kilowatt-hours, but Porsche might downsize it for the Boxster/Cayman to reduce the weight penalty. People buying a sports car are more willing to settle for less range if that means extra performance. If the future 718 gets the same 800-volt architecture as the crossover, it should support DC charging at 270 kilowatts.
Don't expect a design overhaul since Porsche prefers evolutionary over revolutionary. However, the current car's interior is beginning to show its age, which is why prototypes of its replacement have been spotted with a more modern dashboard. Aside from the usual bigger screens, those cars had touch buttons on the center console to adjust the temperature as well as the heated and ventilated seats.
The future 718s will be sold exclusively with electric power but the current Boxster and Cayman are not going away. Although the duo is being phased out in the European Union, the gasoline sports cars are sticking around in other markets. Porsche will sell the ICE and EV models together for an unspecified amount of time before inevitably pulling the plug on the former. It's the same story with the old and new Macan.

VW Says There's No Market for an ID.Buzz Camper Van,https://www.motor1.com/news/713335/vw-no-market-id-buzz-camper/,Rumored production delays due to excessive weight aren't a concern if nobody wants to buy one.,12/25/2024 8:54,"When the Volkswagen ID. Buzz debuted back in 2022, talk of a pop-top camper model pretty much debuted with it. And why not? Camping adventures and the classic VW bus go together like peanut butter and chocolate, but a modern take on this formula is likely years away, if it materializes at all. That is, at least in an ID. Buzz California camper coming directly from Volkswagen.
The holdup isn't development problems as reported last year. According to Autocar, VW executives simply don't see enough demand to warrant the expense of building it right now. Citing Lars Krause, sales and marketing head for VW, there are some expected development challenges that are typical for any new model. But also, buyers aren't ready to commit to an electric camper.
""I can tell you we always start from the market, and looking at the market figures and looking closely at our customers, it turned out that the need for these types of vehicles— BEV-driven campers—is not there yet from our perspective,"" said Krause, as reported by Autocar.
He further states that demand is expected to increase by the end of the decade and that VW is targeting that timeframe for a possible ID. Buzz California launch. In the meantime, there is the Volkswagen California based on the T7 Multivan slated for European markets this year. It debuted last August as a near-production prototype, bringing the iconic California moniker and pop-top roof to a plug-in hybrid platform.
VW Commercial Vehicles CEO Carsten Intra believes it will serve as a stepping stone toward electrified campers, and as such, we suspect its sales will be monitored very closely. If buyers don't respond to a larger PHEV California, it's reasonable to think a smaller EV California could be nixed completely. Only time will tell on that front.
The irony is that, despite bearing the name of a US state, the VW T7 California won't be offered for sale in North America. When (or if) the ID. Buzz California goes live, it could make the journey. It would be based on the long-wheelbase model, which is the only version offered to US buyers.

Audi's New Entry-Level EV Will Be 'Wonderful and Unique',https://www.motor1.com/news/713158/entry-level-audi-ev-2027/,It’ll slot below the Q4 E-Tron and could be called the Q2. It debuts in 2027.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Audi is planning to launch a new, entry-level electric vehicle in 2027. It’ll slot below the Q4 E-Tron in the lineup, but company CEO Gernot Döllner was reluctant to dish out additional details about the upcoming model.
He told Autocar that the new EV would be a ""wonderful, unique independent vehicle concept."" It might ride on the MEB architecture, but Döllner admitted the company hadn’t decided which platform would underpin the car. We’ll likely learn about the EV’s battery size and chemistry, range, and power output at its debut.
Audi will accelerate the car’s development to meet its 2027 launch date. It and other automakers are increasingly wary of cheap Chinese EVs and are responding accordingly. In June last year, VW Group CEO Oliver Blume admitted Audi lagged behind its rivals due to software issues, saying it would speed up the luxury brand’s EV development.
The company will produce its entry-level EV in Ingolstadt, Germany, which could wear the A2/Q2 name. Audi has reserved even numbers for its EVs and odd ones for its combustion-powered cars. While Audi could produce a small sedan, the likelier product is a compact crossover with the Q nomenclature as consumers still flock to the high-riding models.
The Audi Q6 E-Tron debuted earlier this week, joining the portfolio's E-Tron GT, Q4 E-Tron, and Q8 E-Tron models. An entry-level EV would help flesh out the lineup, but it’s three years away from going on sale, and competition will only continue to increase. Audi might not even offer it in the US, and it could still be expensive. The 2024 Q4 E-Tron starts at $56,395 (the price includes the $1,195 destination charge).

Future BMW Electric Cars Will Have Bidirectional Charging,https://www.motor1.com/news/713239/bmw-bidirectional-charging-neue-klasse/,Neue Klasse models will power your household.,12/25/2024 8:54,"The Neue Klasse will be BMW's long-awaited dedicated electric car platform when it debuts next year with an SUV. Previewed today by the Vision Neue Klasse X concept, the architecture is bringing a handy feature that other automakers have had for years. Better late than never, the new wave of EVs with the famous white and blue roundel will support bidirectional charging.
That means the future iX3 SUV (2025) and i3 sedan (2026) will double as power banks to juice up your house, appliances, e-bikes, camping gear, and other products. While luxury automakers tend to charge (pun intended) you for just about everything, bidirectional charging is going to be standard on Neue Klasse-based models. Functions such as Vehicle to Home, Vehicle to Grid, and Vehicle to Load will all be supported without having to pay more.
While the current EVs and PHEVs use batteries with prismatic cells, the next wave of batteries will switch to round cells. BMW estimates that charging speed and range will increase by 30 percent, while energy density is going up by 20 percent. These sixth-generation batteries will power your toaster and whatnot.
BMW intends to roll out bidirectional charging in three stages, kicking off with Vehicle to Home for your household. Vehicle to Grid will follow, allowing the car's owner to feed the stored energy back into the network but only in countries where legislation allows it. Vehicle to Load will power external electrical equipment. Interestingly, the German luxury marque doesn't say anything about Vehicle to Vehicle to provide energy to another Neue Klasse EV.
After the launch of the iX3 and i3, BMW intends to launch at least four more models on the same underpinnings by 2028. By the end of the decade, the Munich-based marque projects more than half of its global annual sales will be represented by EVs. In the early 2030s, Mini and Rolls-Royce will go completely electric.

The New Three-Row Peugeot 5008 Has Hybrid and Electric Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/713069/2024-peugeot-5008-reveal-specs/,The boxy SUV gets a 21-inch screen and a striking front fascia.,12/25/2024 8:54,"The third-generation Peugeot 5008 plugs into Europe's already crowded SUV segment in more ways than one. It's available with a fully electric drivetrain but you can also have the three-row family hauler with a plug-in hybrid setup. Alternatively, the French brand part of Stellantis plans to sell a cheaper mild-hybrid model as well.
Essentially, the new 5008 is an enlarged version of the latest 3008 introduced in 2023. It sits on the STLA Medium platform and has the following dimensions: 188.5 inches long, 74.4 inches wide, and 66.5 inches tall, with a generous wheelbase of 114.1 inches. One major advantage it has over the Tesla Model Y sold in Europe is the availability of a third row.
You can imagine there's not much cargo space left with all seven seats in place, but 9.1 cubic feet should suffice for short trips around town. In the five-seat configuration, the luggage capacity jumps to 26.4 cubic feet. Should you need even more, you can fold the second row as well and unlock a cavernous 64.0 cubic feet.
While SUVs nowadays tend to have swoopy rooflines, the new Peugeot 5008 retains the boxy shape of its predecessor to maximize interior space. It largely inherits the design of its E-3008 smaller brother, complete with the same 21-inch display positioned atop the dashboard. There are also 10 customizable touch controls providing shortcuts to often-used functions accessible from the center console.
The most affordable version will be powered by a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with 48V technology. This tiny three-cylinder mill sends 136 horsepower to the front wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission featuring a built-in electric motor.
Should you need more oomph, the plug-in hybrid combines a 150-hp combustion engine with a 123-hp electric motor for a total system output of 195 hp channeled through a seven-speed, dual-clutch auto. This PHEV can cover more than 50 miles on electric power before the gas engine starts feeding from the 15.8-gallon fuel tank.
Then there’s the fully electric E-5008 model available in multiple configurations. The single-motor, front-wheel-drive versions come with 210 hp and 228 hp, both of which offer an instant torque of 254 pound-feet. Step up to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model, and the combined output is rated at 318 hp.
Stick to the front-wheel-drive model and Peugeot installs a 73.0-kilowatt-hour battery good for 311 miles. The bigger 98.0-kWh pack means fewer stops at a charging station since the range grows to 410 miles. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version gets the bigger battery but efficiency takes a hit due to the vehicle's higher curb weight.
Those batteries are guaranteed for eight years or 100,000 miles during which Peugeot is sure charging capacity won't drop below 70 percent. A heat pump comes as standard, as does the 11-kW charger. You can optionally get a 22-kilowatt charger, while DC charging can support up to 160 kW. In this case, it takes 10 minutes to put enough energy in the battery for 62 miles. Spending half an hour at a charging station replenishes the battery from 20 to 80 percent.
In recent years, Stellantis has ruled out a return for Peugeot to North America but that STLA Medium platform is likely to underpin a series of US-bound electric models.

"The New Audi A5, Q5, And A6 E-Tron Confirmed For 2024 Reveal",https://www.motor1.com/news/713087/audi-a5-q5-a6-e-tron-coming-2024/,More than 20 new models are due by late 2025.,12/25/2024 8:54,"It's only March, but Audi has already introduced several new products. It started with the updated Q7 in late January before the RS6 Avant GT arrived in early February. The revised S3 debuted a few days later, followed by the normal A3 facelift last week. The first-ever Q6 E-Tron joined the fray a few days ago. But there's much more to come later this year.
The 154-page Audi Report 2023 document mentions more than 20 new products will hit the market before the end of next year. Leading the way will be the A6 E-Tron (pictured above in prototype guise). It's arriving in the following months as a fully electric model based on the Premium Platform Electric. The PPE hardware has been co-developed with Porsche and has already underpinned the Q6 E-Tron and Macan. The new A6 E-Tron will be sold as a sedan (well, it'll technically be a five-door hatchback) and as a wagon.
In the year's second half, Audi will take the wraps off the next-generation A5 lineup and the Q5. These models will ride on what the Four Rings refers to as the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), which will be an evolution of the VW Group's existing MLB architecture. The German luxury brand doesn't mention the A4 at all, and that's because it's going away.
The A4 we know today will become the A5, leaving room in the lineup for a future electric-only A4 E-Tron. Audi doesn't say whether there will be another sedan in this segment with combustion engines or whether the A5 Sportback will supersede the A4 Sedan. Spy shots have revealed the wagon will live to see another generation, so prepare for A5/S5/RS5 Avant models to be offered alongside the Sportback.
Car paparazzi haven't seen any prototypes of an A5 coupe or a convertible but here's hoping the two-door models are still planned. That said, the segment is shrinking, which is why Mercedes has fused the C-Class and E-Class coupe and convertible models to create the CLE.
The Q5 will enter its third generation in 2024, and just like the upcoming A5, it's getting a new family of ""highly efficient"" combustion engines with plug-in hybrid power. These will be the last ICE developments from Audi since the brand intends to launch its final cars with conventional powertrains in 2026. Every new launch after will be an EV because the company wants to go purely electric by the end of 2033.
Meanwhile, here are some of the other models we think are coming out by late 2025. There should be a Q3 compact crossover successor, a facelifted RS3 hot hatch/sedan duo, a Q6 E-Tron Sportback with a rakish roofline, an electric A8 sedan replacement, and a Q9 three-row SUV.
The A1 and Q2 won't be renewed as Audi has announced that these models will be retired at the end of their life cycle. The TT suffered the same fate last year when it was discontinued, with the R8 facing an imminent death as well.

GM Thinks Tetris-Shaped Batteries Could Be the Key to Better Cooling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712993/gm-tetris-shaped-battery-cells/,Battery cells are typically only rectangular or cylindrical. GM might change that.,12/25/2024 8:54,"General Motors has plans to operate four battery plants, with one in Lordstown, Ohio already pumping out cells. With the ability to make its own batteries comes the potential for custom configurations and form factors, something the company is considering taking to the extreme. A recent patent from GM shows batteries not shaped like rectangles or cylinders, but Tetris-like blocks meant to accommodate more efficient cooling channels.
The document is currently just an application, but it was published very recently in late February, with a recent file date as well. All of this seems to indicate it's a new idea out of the automaker that it may have wanted to protect quickly. It begins by saying how battery cells are currently cooled, at least in GM's case. In cars like the Hummer EV, we know this is achieved on a module-by-module basis with a cooling plate at the bottom of the cells. In this patent, GM claims this method can lead to uneven cooling, which leads to premature battery degradation. As a side note, other companies use other cooling methods to combat this phenomenon.
GM's idea is to make the cells in a rough ""L"" or ""C"" shape so that two cells combined will leave one or more tunnels between the cells where a cooling channel can be added. GM even has some unusual diagonal shapes in there.
I'm not aware of any other battery cell, at least in automotive use, that is shaped anything like this.  I have personally only ever seen rectangular prisms or cylinders. There might be considerable manufacturing challenges associated with making these strange cells, though it's tough to tell going only by this application.
To that end, the company suggests other possible configurations using rectangular prismatic cells but achieving a similar effect. Two of the cells in a proposed four-cell group would be shorter and fatter, while the other pair would be longer and skinnier. This would allow for a rectangular or H-shaped cooling channel. Longer and skinnier cells like that are less common, but there's one China-based company, Topband, that makes somewhat similar long slender lithium iron-phosphate cells.
In any case, GM's idea is an unusual one that may have some merit, but it's unclear if developing an entirely new cell format in the name of cooling would be an effective approach to improving electric vehicles. If the company patented it, it's likely worth exploring, at least conceptually.

Bentley Delays First EV Due To Software Problems,https://www.motor1.com/news/712921/bentley-first-electric-vehicle-delayed/,It's also pushing back the goal to become electric-only from 2030 to 2033.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Bentley intended to introduce its first electric model in 2025—but that's not happening. CEO Adrian Hallmark told Automotive News Europe the EV has been delayed by a year because of technical problems caused by software issues as well as ""platform-related concerns."" Crewe's inaugural EV is now expected to break cover near the end of 2026, but customer deliveries won't start until 2027.
Separately, Autocar has learned Bentley is also pushing back its goal to become entirely electric by the end of the decade. According to the new agenda, the ultra-luxury British brand wants to completely get rid of gasoline cars by 2033. The three-year delay will allow the company to invest more in plug-in hybrids to provide a smoother transition to an EV-only lineup early into the next decade.
The inaugural EV is going to be manufactured at home in the UK and will be underpinned by the Premium Platform Electric co-developed by Porsche and Audi. The first PPE-based models have been recently revealed as the second-generation Macan in January and the Q6 E-Tron earlier this week. While all three brands sit underneath the Volkswagen Group umbrella, Audi technically owns Bentley (as well as Lamborghini and Ducati) since 2022.
The decision to delay the EV isn't surprising. The Macan and Q6 E-Tron were also supposed to arrive sooner, per the original announcements. Before the first zero-emission model arrives, Bentley is preparing to launch a high-performance plug-in hybrid setup based around a V-8. It'll indirectly replace the venerable W-12, which is sadly going away with the 740-horsepower Batur.
The company's head honcho admits Bentley had estimated demand for hybrids would decrease closer to the end of the decade, but it's now expected to rise. Consequently, the high-end automaker is pouring ""hundreds of millions"" into a new wave of PHEVs that'll remain on sale early into the next decade to meet demand.
We'll be seeing that punchy V8 PHEV setup in the GT, GTC, and Flying Spur later in 2024. The current V-6 PHEV is staying while the Bentayga will retain its pure gasoline powertrain until 2026 when the posh SUV is set to become electric-only.
The now-delayed EV won't replace an existing model as it'll be a completely different product. When it does arrive, it's getting a hotter Speed version touted as ""the W12 of batteries"" with electric motors developed to deliver 50 to 100 percent more power than ICEs. For now, the most potent model on this PPE platform is the Porsche Macan Turbo with 630 hp and 833 pound-feet of torque.
The batteries that will go inside Bentley's first EV will have enough juice for 350 to 450 miles on a single charge, according to a statement made last year by Hallmark. It'll take less than 20 minutes to replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent.
For the time being, the Bentayga is the undisputed sales king with a 44-percent share of the total volume in 2023. The Continental GT/GTC is next with 31 percent while the Flying Spur occupies the last spot on the podium with a 25-percent share. In 2023, total deliveries dropped by 11 percent to 13,560 units.

Porsche Electric Hypercar: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/712820/porsche-electric-hypercar-horsepower-range-price/,A new Porsche halo car is on the horizon. And it’s going to be electric (literally).,12/25/2024 8:54,"Porsche is on a steady path toward electrifying its entire lineup. The company launched the Taycan in 2019, and the new Macan EV will go on sale later this year. An electric 718 is set to debut in 2024, with the Cayenne joining the EV bandwagon sometime after that.
Still, we're most excited about what could sit at the top of Porsche's electric portfolio: A new hypercar.
Porsche teased us with the stunning Mission X concept last year, and we could see a production version by the end of 2024. The company has been tight-lipped about the project otherwise. But there are some early rumors and details that paint a thrilling picture of what could be the brand's next icon. Here’s what we know so far.
The Porsche Mission X is a concept that debuted in 2023 as part of the automaker's 75th-anniversary celebration. Engineers worked under the codename XS23 for up to a year ahead of its reveal.
The Mission X previews what a future, all-electric hypercar could look like from the brand. It would succeed models like the 918 Spyder and the Carrera GT. The Mission X draws inspiration from those icons as well as Porsche's success on the track.
Porsche took cues from Le Mans prototype race cars like the 919 Hybrid, most notably with the doors that open forward and upward. Vertical headlights adorn a pointed nose with massive air intakes at the base of the bumper that help with cooling and aerodynamics.
A glass bubble covers a luxurious cabin lined with deep bucket seats, contrasting colors, exposed carbon, six-point harnesses, and an F1-inspired steering wheel. That glass cabin forms a svelte rear with an embedded spoiler and an illuminated Porsche logo flanked by slim taillights on either side.
Hopefully the production version looks a lot like the Mission X, but it's unclear how many of these cues will translate to the road. Our rendering (pictured above) previews a production version of the Porsche Mission X with many of the same elements as the concept but with Porsche's paint-to-sample Smyrna Green, aerodynamic-friendly wheels, and a few other subtle touches.
Believe it or not, the Porsche Mission X concept has a mid-motor layout. Unlike other EVs that position their batteries in the floorboard, the Mission X's batteries are behind the seats. They call it an ""e-core"" configuration. Porsche did this to try and recreate the handling dynamics of a mid-engine car. It's unclear whether that same layout will make it to production.
Beyond that, Porsche hasn't offered specifics about the powertrain. The Mission X concept had a power-to-weight ratio of one horsepower per 2.2 pounds and a 900-volt architecture. So if the new hypercar weighs around 3,700 pounds—like the 918 Spyder—it could have as much as 1,700 horsepower. It should also be Porsche's first vehicle with three electric motors and all-wheel drive.
With an estimated 1,700 hp, Porsche's EV hypercar should be pretty damn quick. The dual-motor Taycan Turbo GT will hit 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds with the Weissach package, so a tri-motor hypercar could be even quicker. Under 2.0 seconds isn't out of the realm of possibility.
Porsche has already said it wants to break the Nurburgring production lap time, which would mean outpacing the Mercedes-AMG One's 6:30.70 lap time. If it's gunning for the production EV record, it would have to beat the Rimac Nevera's 7:05.29 lap time. The Porsche 918 Spyder completed a lap of the Nurburgring in 6:57.00.
The Mission X concept is relatively compact by modern supercar standards. It’s about 6 inches shorter than the 918 Spyder; 182.9 versus 177.0 inches. And it’s a full 10 inches shorter than the Rimac Nevera (187.0 inches). However, the Mission X is 2.0 inches wider than the 918 and has the same wheelbase of 107.5 inches.
Expect Porsche's hypercar to command over six figures. The company recently introduced the Taycan Turbo GT with 1,092 horsepower and a starting price of $232,000, making it Porsche's priciest EV to date. The electric hypercar should easily beat that to become one of the most expensive cars on sale.
For comparison's sake, the 918 Spyder went on sale in 2013 for $845,000—but current hypercar prices easily stretch into the millions. The Rimac Nevera costs $2.4 million, the Mercedes-AMG One is $2.7 million, and the Aston Martin Valkyrie is over $3.0 million.
Production of Porsche's new hypercar is expected to be limited. The company only built 918 examples of the 918 Spyder, and the Carrera GT was limited to just 1,270 examples. The 959 was even rarer still; Porsche only built 292 of them.
Porsche could confirm production of the new hypercar by the end of this year. CEO Oliver Blume said that feedback on the Mission X concept has been ""massively positive,"" and that ""it’s a great motivation for us to do the car.""

The First Standalone Mercedes-AMG EV Has NA Miata-Looking Fake Taillights,https://www.motor1.com/news/712744/amg-electric-sedan-prototype-teaser/,"Don't worry, the production model will have different rear lights.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Hiding underneath the swirly camouflage and those Miata-like taillights is the first Mercedes model on the AMG.EA platform. It's a sports sedan engineered from day one strictly as an EV to serve as a replacement for the current AMG 4-Door Coupe. The latter has already received the hybrid treatment, but its successor will forgo the combustion engine altogether to embrace a pure EV setup.
Judging by the swoopy shape of the prototype's rear, it'll be a more practical liftback rather than a traditional sedan. That wouldn’t come as a surprise since the outgoing model is also a five-door hatchback, despite its confusing ""coupe"" name. A closer look at these official teaser images reveals an active rear spoiler and front canards. The production version should have more than a few things in common with the 2022 Vision AMG Concept.
The road-going model will go after the likes of the Porsche Taycan by offering a more dynamic ride than AMG versions of the EQE. It will use disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors with ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight"" compared to traditional cylindrical radial-flux motors. The peeps from Affalterbach have already revealed one motor can churn 480 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque while weighing only 53 pounds.
Aside from having new motors, the AMG.EA-based model is expected to employ a slimmer battery pack with a 40 percent boost in energy density. The dedicated architecture should also enable a roomier cabin by not having to make compromises associated with ICE cars adapted for EV duty. This will be possible by stretching the wheelbase and shortening the front and rear overhangs. The SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012 was an ICE-to-EV supercar.
Currently testing on a frozen lake in Sweden at temperatures as low as -13 degrees Fahrenheit, the sporty EV is heading to other regions of the world for additional evaluations. We're not expecting the high-performance electric model to go on sale this year but the official reveal might take place late 2024 or early 2025.

Volkswagen Will Reveal its High-Performance ID.Buzz GTX on March 21,https://www.motor1.com/news/712626/vw-id-buzz-gtx-reveal-march-21/,"Spotted testing at the Nürburgring last year, the performance-oriented electric van will carry the GTX nameplate.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Volkswagen announced on Friday plans to reveal a new performance vehicle during its annual press conference happening March 21. The company published a teaser image to LinkedIn alongside the announcement showing the headlight silhouette of an ID.Buzz electric van, suggesting a high-performance version of VW's people-mover is less than a month away.
Confirmed for production at the beginning of 2023, the ID.Buzz GTX will join the company's other sporty EV offerings, the ID.3 GTX and the ID.7 GTX Tourer, in VW's growing list of high-performance, zero-emissions vehicles.
Volkswagen's been mum on details regarding the ID.Buzz GTX, saying only that it'll make 335 horsepower thanks to a dual-motor all-wheel drive system, mirroring output on the ID.7 GTX. We expect other upgrades too, like a stiffer suspension, better brakes, bigger wheels, and a sportier interior.
The ID.Buzz GTX has been on our radar for months now. An all-white test mule said to be a prototype for the car was spotted by our spy photographers on the road last summer. Not long after that, it was caught lapping the Nürburgring during an industry test pool session. So the timing of this reveal makes sense.
It's unclear right now whether Volkswagen is planning to bring this high-performance ID.Buzz variant to the United States. Neither the ID.3 GTX nor the ID.7 GTX tourer are slated for US consumption, and the normal ID.Buzz has yet to even go on sale Stateside. Moreover, Volkswagen's electric GTI has yet to be greenlit for the US. With demand for electric vehicles waning, a sporty EV van sounds like a very niche product that might not conjure the demand VW expects. Either way, we'd love to give one a go.

The Skoda Epiq Has A Pompous Name But It's Just Another Electric Crossover,https://www.motor1.com/news/712518/skoda-epiq-concept-debut/,"The production version is coming in 2025 and will cost the equivalent of $27,000.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Skoda intends to launch six EVs by 2026, and the most affordable of the bunch will be this pretentiously named Epiq. It’s scheduled to go on sale next year with a targeted starting price of €25,000, or roughly $27,000 at current exchange rates. Touted as being ""small but epic,"" the brand's entry-level EV will be among the first models to embrace the fresh ""Modern Solid"" design language.
At around 4.1 meters (161.4 inches) long, you can think of it as an electric alternative to the Kamiq. However, the subcompact Skoda Epiq is destined to ride on a dedicated EV platform, likely the MEB Entry the Volkswagen Group has already announced. The architecture has been previewed by the German automotive conglomerate with last year's ID.2all concept. While VW is going the hatchback route, Skoda is cooking up this crossover.
Even though it's shorter than the Kamiq we mentioned earlier, it's far more practical. The cargo capacity of 490 liters (17.3 cubic feet) is more than 20 percent higher thanks to the dedicated EV underpinnings, resulting in better packaging. The Czech marque remains tight-lipped about the other technical specifications, but it does say the unspecified battery pack is good for over 249 miles (400 kilometers) of range, presumably in the WLTP cycle.
The MEB Entry platform is intended for EVs with front-wheel drive whereas the regular MEB used by the bigger Enyaq comes with rear-wheel drive. The more expensive and powerful MEB-based models sold by the VW Group come with AWD by adding a front motor. It remains to be seen whether the MEB Entry models will get an all-paw setup at some point.
The Modern Solid design language per Skoda's marketing jargon will toughen up the appearance of future models. This Epiq has plastic body cladding around the wheel arches and unpainted sections of the rear bumpers. We also notice a pair of nifty roof rails, an illuminated rear badge, and slim lights at both ends.
The charging port is mounted on the front fender rather than at the back as is the case with the Enyaq. Contrasting orange accents are found inside and out, along with an interrupted light bar that goes across the wide grille. Overall, the Epiq looks to be more along the lines of a near-production prototype since it's unlikely to change all that much until 2025. Skoda calls it a design study rather than a concept.
Before the Epiq arrives in 2025, the bigger Elroq compact crossover will be officially unveiled later this year with an electric-only setup. These two will be joined by 2026 by the next-generation Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe. An Octavia-like wagon in EV flavor is also coming, along with a large three-row SUV previewed by the Vision 7S sans a combustion engine.

"Majority Of Drivers Are Afraid Of Autonomous Cars, Study Says",https://www.motor1.com/news/712439/drivers-afraid-autonomous-cars-study/,"Sixty-six percent of respondents said they feared self-driving cars, up from 55 percent in 2022.",12/25/2024 8:54,"The promise of fully self-driving cars remains elusive. That might be a good thing, at least going by a new study from AAA that found the majority of people are actually afraid of autonomous vehicles. Even more surprising: That number has increased in recent years while public trust has fallen.
According to AAA, 66 percent of respondents said they feared self-driving vehicles. That’s up from 55 percent in 2022, but down from 68 percent last year. The share of those who trust AVs held steady from 2023 to 2024 at 9 percent, while 25 percent were unsure of them. Both numbers are down from 15 and 30 percent, respectively, in 2022.
While buyers might be weary of robot cars, they aren’t opposed to some technological assistance behind the wheel. Respondents said they were interested in some technology, with more than half open to automatic braking, reverse automatic braking, and lane keep assist. Only 42 percent were interested in active driving assist, and 49 percent were for adaptive cruise control.
Are Self-Driving Cars The Future:
Buyers should be skeptical of even those driver aids, however, as another AAA study discovered that they aren’t always reliable. The organization recently researched the effectiveness of automatic rear braking systems, and only one out of 40 test runs ended without a crash. Half of the cars failed to stop for stationary pedestrians standing behind the vehicle.
Most buyers won’t have to worry about autonomous vehicles anytime soon. General Motors’ Cruise division has faced significant safety hurdles over the last few months, and it appears that Google’s Waymo is one of the remaining outfits putting in a full effort to develop the technology. It expanded its robotaxi service to Los Angeles today, but the tech is still years away from making it into everyday passenger vehicles.

15 Fastest EVs To Lap The Nurburgring,https://www.motor1.com/features/712434/fastest-ev-nurburgring/,"Some are production cars, others are track-only—but all of them are silent speed demons.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Porsche's new Taycan Turbo GT just broke a record to become the fastest production four-door to lap the famed Nurburgring Nordschleife—and the second-fastest production EV. Porsche accomplished that feat in 7:07.55, making it quicker around the Green Hell than a vast majority of cars on sale today, gas or electric.
But it's not the reigning EV champion. One production car and a few electric race cars and concepts have done it faster. Since 2010, automakers have been taking their performance EVs to the track in hopes of capturing a lap record. And as more performance EVs enter the market, expect more record-breaking laps in the months and years to come.
In the meantime, we've put together a list of the 15 fastest electric vehicles to ever do it. These cars all have a spot in the Nurburgring record books for their fast laps, and some of them won't see their records broken anytime soon.
6:05.3
Before the ID.4, the ID.Buzz, and the rest of Volkswagen's electric vehicle lineup, the mad scientists in Wolfsburg cooked an EV concept the world had never seen. The ID.R was a no-holds-barred, battery-powered race car with 671 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque thanks to two electric motors—oh, and it only weighed 2,500 pounds.
In 2019, VW unleashed the ID.R on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with French racing driver Romain Dumas behind the wheel. The epic run resulted in a record-breaking lap time of 6:05.336, making it the fastest EV—and one of the fastest cars ever—around the historic track. There isn't a single production car that's faster, and only the Porsche 919 Hybrid EVO race car had a better lap time (5:19.546).
6:45.9
The Nio EP9 isn't technically a production car, even though the company built and sold 10 of them between 2016 and 2019 for a cool $3 million each. The track-only hypercar had four electric motors mounted on each wheel for a total output of 1,341 horsepower and 1,091 pound-feet of torque, good for a 0-60 mph time of around 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 194 mph.
In 2017, Nio let the EP9 loose on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with British racing driver Peter Dumbreck behind the wheel. Dumbreck set a lap time of 6:45.90—beating the Nio's former record 7:05.12 set in 2016 (this time with race tires), and second only to the McLaren P1 XP1 LM Prototype at the time, which did it in 6:43.22. The EV9 is currently fifth on the list of non-production cars and second only in EVs to the VW ID.R.
7:05.2
The first real, actual production car on this list is the Rimac Nevera—even if it is a $2.2-million hypercar. Powered by four permanent-magnet synchronous electric motors, the Nevera has 1,888 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 1.7 seconds. It is, by definition, the quickest car on sale today.
It's no slouch on the track, either. Late in 2023, Rimac set a production EV record with the Nevera on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with a lap time of 7:05.29. Croatian racing driver Martin Kodric was behind the wheel.
7:07.5
The newest entrant on this list (as mentioned earlier) is the Taycan Turbo GT—the quickest, most powerful production Porsche ever. With up to 1,092 horsepower courtesy of two electric motors, this Taycan races to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds and on to a top speed of 190. And with the Wiessach package (the first four-door Porsche to get the option), this Taycan ditches the rear seats and adds carbon fiber to keep the hefty EV under 5,000 pounds.
Back in January, Porsche took a Taycan Turbo GT prototype with the Weissach package to the Nurburgring and recorded a lap time of 7:07.55. With seasoned racing driver Lars Kern behind the wheel, the Turbo GT became the fastest four-door EV on the ‘Ring and the fastest of any four-door production sedan, beating out the Jaguar XE Project 8.
7:22.3
In case the name didn't give it away, this is no production Toyota. The TMG EV P002 was an electric race car prototype produced by Toyota in 2012 with 469 horsepower and 885 pound-feet of torque. With Jochen Krumbach behind the wheel, Toyota took to the Nurburgring that same year and recorded a fast lap of 7:22.32. At that time Toyota did break the EV lap record, but it was short-lived.
7:25.2
The Porsche/Tesla rivalry escalated in 2023. Tesla returned to the Nordschleife two years after its first run with another Model S Plaid, this time fitted with an optional Track package. The Track pack added better brakes a higher top-speed limiter, as well as controversial tires. While legal in the US, the tires didn't meet European requirements for road use, leading some to call the lap null and void for a street-legal vehicle.
However you view it, the hefty sedan still covered the north loop in 7:25.2. It easily topped the Taycan Turbo S to claim the EV production record once again, but it was short-lived. A few months later, the Rimac Nevera would sail in to effectively shut down the Porsche/Tesla rivalry.
7:33.3
The second Taycan record attempt at the Nurburgring came in 2022. Whether or not Tesla's 2021 record with the Model S Plaid had anything to do with it is unknown, but Porsche managed to lop off nearly 10 seconds compared to the lap laid down by the Taycan Turbo.
At 7:33.3, the Turbo S also beat the Model S Plaid by a few seconds to reclaim the EV record. In addition to the extra power available from the Turbo S, the car had a new performance kit and the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control system. These aren't aftermarket upgrades, meaning the lap time is official for a series production vehicle.
More From The Nurburgring
7:35.5
It wasn't long after Tesla announced the upgraded Model S Plaid that rumors of a Nurburgring record attempt surfaced. The rumors were fueled by Model S sightings at the track in 2021, putting its tri-motor powertrain with 1,020 horsepower to the test.
And the rumors were ultimately true. The sizable sedan recorded an official lap time of 7:35.5—falling short of expectations for a low 7-minute run but still enough to beat the Taycan Turbo. For a little while, anyway.
7:42.3
Launching in 2019 for the 2020 model year, the Taycan Turbo is Porsche's first modern EV. And it's an impressive debut, wielding 616 horsepower in normal operation or 671 ponies with overboost activated. Porsche lists a 0-60 mph time of 3.0 seconds flat. And this is the ""base"" model Taycan.
While technically the slowest Porsche Taycan at the Nurburgring, it's still plenty fast. The automaker clocked an official time of 7:42.3 with a preproduction model back in 2019, matching the previous-generation BMW M4 CS. That's not bad for a beefy electric four-door sedan.
7:44.8
In the early 2010s, this one-off electric sports car was making waves. Developed and built in Finland by the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, it first attacked the Nurburgring in 2011, but couldn’t quite break the 8-minute barrier. The group wasn’t done trying.
Pumping out 400 horsepower through a quad-motor powertrain, the team returned in 2015 and Sport Auto drove it for a properly quick 7:44.8 lap. At the time it was an EV record for a street-legal car, though being a one-off, it obviously couldn’t claim production status.
7:45.5
We haven't seen much of Kia or Hyundai at the Nurburgring, at least with regards to lap times. The South Korean conglomerate has a plethora of EVs on sale now or coming soon, and the Ioniq 5 N is decidedly aimed at fans of performance. With up to 641 horsepower available in short spurts with the N Grin Boost function (N for Nurburgring, obviously), there's plenty of power to go fast.
The N treatment doesn't simply add power, as the folks from the German publication Sport Auto—who accomplished the lap—found out. Bigger brakes, lower suspension, and sticky tires contributed to an impressive 7:45.5 lap time with driver Christian Gebhardt behind the wheel.
7:56.2
Long before the letters EQ were synonymous with electric Mercedes vehicles, there was the SLS AMG Electric Drive. With gullwing doors and a day-glo paint job, the supercar was impossible to miss. And when it debuted in 2012, it backed up those good looks with 738 horsepower. A 60.0-kilowatt-hour battery powered four electric motors, sending the 4,700-pound car to 60 mph in less than four seconds.
A timed lap around the Nordschleife followed in 2013, sending the electric SLS under the eight-minute mark. Unfortunately, the battery only had enough power to make one full-power lap, and under normal driving conditions, the range was barely 120 miles. Around 100 were initially planned for production, but only nine were made.
8:09.0
It's hard to believe the Audi R8 E-Tron debuted 15 years ago. Back then, it was a pre-production supercar known best for its appearance in the Iron Man movie franchise. But it wasn't just a pretty face, utilizing a dual-motor powertrain with a 49.0-kilowatt-hour battery generating 376 horsepower and 605 pound-feet of torque. It doesn't sound like much these days, but in 2012, that was enough to give the R8 E-Tron the EV Nordschleife record with a lap time of 8:09.
The R8 E-Tron became a proper production car in 2015, but the run was short-lived. Less that 100 were ultimately built before Audi pulled the plug just one year later, leaving space for other E-Tron models to follow. Ironically, none of those have made official Nurburgring lap attempts.
9:01.34
Peugeot was a player in the early days of the modern EV era with the EX1 concept. Unlike concepts from Audi or Porsche, Peugeot had no illusion about sending this to production. A tiny two-seater with an open cockpit, it relied on a lightweight design with a dual-motor powertrain generating just 335 horsepower.
In 2011, that was enough for Peugeot to claim a Nurburgring record for EVs. The lap time of 9:01.34 was far from competitive in the combustion segment, but it outclassed the Mini E's 2010 lap by nearly a full minute.
9:52.0
In the infancy of electrification, Mini debuted the E prototype—a gas-converted Cooper with a modest 201 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque. The skunkworks project eventually led to the production BMW i3, but not before a go ‘round the ‘Ring.
In 2010, Thomas Jagr completed a lap of the Nordschleife behind the wheel of the Mini E Racer in 9:52. It was the first EV ever to complete a timed lap of the Nurburgring, and while it isn’t holding on to any records these days, a sub-10-minute time for a fledgling technology was impressive nonetheless.",Christopher Smith
The Hyundai ST1 Is An Electric Work Van With Futuristic Styling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712338/hyundai-st1-work-van-reveal/,It looks like it traveled back from the future to do work.,12/25/2024 8:54,"And now for something completely different from Hyundai – a fully electric work van that looks like it has traveled back from the future. The ST1 sounds like the name of a trim level for a Ford Fiesta ST (RIP) or Focus ST sold in Europe. However, this alphanumeric designation denotes a purpose-built lineup of workhorses bundled as ""Service Type 1"" vehicles.
In typical Hyundai fashion, this initial reveal is only about the exterior design, with no details about technical specifications. We do know the ST1 is exclusively electric and has been developed to cater to small businesses in South Korea. It will be offered as a regular cargo van, a refrigerated van, and as a basic chassis cab for owners to retrofit the type of equipment they need.
Hyundai says it worked with local delivery companies to find out what they need from a work van. Riding on steelies and fitted with unpainted bumpers, the workhorse has a futuristic front-end design derived from the Staria minivan or the Kona small crossover. The main headlights are mounted unusually low while the full-width horizontal strip above is presumably for the daytime running lights.
The ST1 is tailored to those who need a more spacious van than what the Staria Load can offer and has chunky plastic cladding all around to protect the body. Much like on the Kona EV, the charging port is mounted at the front, to the right of what appears to be a small air intake. Hyundai likely had a good reason to put the front camera on the painted section of the bumper instead of moving it lower to blend it with the black plastic.
Hyundai says it developed the ST1 with the intent to make it easier to load and unload cargo by lowering the ride height. Although it looks like a box on wheels, the front upper spoiler was conceived with aerodynamic efficiency in mind. Even the bulky garnish connecting the cabin to the cargo area was designed to provide better airflow.
Full details and pricing will be disclosed in the first half of 2024 before the ST1 hits the domestic market later this year. Hyundai intends to sell the workhorse in other regions after the ST1 goes on sale in Korea.

It'll ride on the same STLA Large platform as the 2024 Charger but with a radically different design.
Speaking with the Italian press at an event held in Arese at the Alfa Romeo Museum, the company's head honcho says the design is locked in. They've been working on the car's styling for the last two years and we're being promised the result is nothing short of exceptional: ""What we designed is a bomb, we couldn’t finalize the style of this car without being absolutely in love with it. And now we are!""

The new Giulia will be built alongside the Stelvio SUV, with both vehicles to be manufactured at the factory in Cassino. Alfa Romeo told us the Stelvio will be the first to go on sale at some point in 2025, followed about a year later by its sedan counterpart. We asked Imparato how Stellantis is going to separate the new Giulia from the Charger. Alfa Romeo's head honcho told us the STLA Large platform offers great flexibility in terms of overall length, wheelbase, width, height, etc.
It remains to be seen whether the next Giulia will stick to the traditional three-box sedan formula or will adopt a swoopy fastback silhouette as previously hinted at by company officials. If the latter is what Alfa Romeo has in mind, the shape could echo other Stellantis products like the Peugeot 4008 and Citroën C5 X.
Although there have been reports about Giulia and Stelvio going electric-only, that's not true. The STLA Large platform has been conceived to accommodate both combustion engines and electric drivetrains—as demonstrated on the new Dodge Charger. Consequently, the two Alfa Romeo models will come with ICE and EV power, plus a combination of both with a hybrid setup.

By 2027, Alfa Romeo will have electric versions of all models. The Milano small crossover will get the ball rolling on April 10, the Giulia and Stelvio will get zero-emission setups in the next couple of years, and a bigger SUV could follow in the latter half of the decade. Alternatively, Imparato suggested it might be a large aero-optimized sedan, but a final decision won't be taken until the end of this year. Whichever model gets the green light, it won't go on sale before 2028.
Alfa's top brass also touched on reviving the Duetto moniker for a compact electric car, potentially a coupe and/or a convertible: ""Alfa Romeo is the only brand that is capable of making a car costing €30,000 up to €2 million. You can't just make up a Duetto. But if you make a C-segment [car] you can make a Coupe or Spyder version that would be a great thing to do. The sound of silence.""
If we look at the sales numbers, Alfa Romeo is on the right track as shipments grew by 30 percent in 2023. Since the entry-level Milano is hitting dealers later this year, 2024 is shaping up to be an excellent year as well. With the new Stelvio (2025) and Giulia (2026) coming along, the second part of the decade could see Alfa blossom into a true rival for the German trifecta.
When FCA and PSA merged, Stellantis promised to keep all 14 brands underneath its corporate umbrella by investing for 10 years. Alfa Romeo received a major cash influx to revamp its lineup, and the same is happening to other troubled Italian brands such as Maserati, Fiat, Lancia, and Abarth. Even the French luxury marque DS Automobiles is sticking around for the time being.

Mercedes-Benz Might Finally Bring the V-Class Name To America,https://www.motor1.com/news/711983/mercedes-electric-van-v-class-us/,It goes on sale in 2026.,12/25/2024 8:54,"When Mercedes-Benz brings its next-generation van to America, it’ll reportedly wear the V-Class name. Unnamed Mercedes officials confirmed to WardsAuto that the model would drop the EQV nomenclature when it goes on sale in 2026.
Mercedes detailed its van plans in May 2023, announcing the VAN.EA architecture that’ll underpin new mid-size luxury vans in the US and elsewhere. According to this latest report, Mercedes will offer the van with single- and dual-motor setups in rear- and all-wheel drive configurations and two battery capacities.
Mercedes declined to comment on WardAuto's report when reached by Motor1, telling us it cannot discuss future product plans.
Mercedes said last year the vans would have a targeted range of over 310 miles. Like most vans on the market, the company will offer it in a variety of wheelbases and seating configurations. The platform will also underpin larger cargo vans built for customizability.
Additionally, the platform will underpin mid- and full-size camper vans to entice buyers. It’ll compete with the ID. Buzz California Camper variant Volkswagen announced in 2021, set to reach dealerships sometime after 2025.
Mercedes previously offered the Metris in the US, but dismal sales killed the model at the end of 2023. Lackluster demand didn’t stunt the brand’s enthusiasm for offering vans in the US, though. Hopefully they'll be a bit more successful this time around.

"The Most Expensive Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Costs $286,845",https://www.motor1.com/news/711962/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-configurator/,"The Turbo GT's configurator is already live. Unlike other Porsche models, there aren't many options to up-spec the pricey Turbo GT.",12/25/2024 8:54,"The latest iteration of the Porsche Taycan is here, and it doesn't hold anything back. Billed as the most powerful production model in Porsche's history, the Turbo GT delivers a 1,092-horsepower kick in the butt, albeit for a few seconds in Attack Mode. It's not just a straight-line scorcher either, having set new lap records for production EVs at Laguna Seca and the Nürburgring in range-topping Weissach Package trim. Thanks to Porsche's new configurator, we get to see exactly how many extras the Turbo GT has in store.
After spending a few minutes playing with the configurator, we've come to the conclusion that it's not what you can get on the Turbo GT, but rather, what you can't. We've grown accustomed to complex Porsche configurators overflowing with options that occasionally add nearly $100,000 to the sticker price. Here, the options list is surprisingly short. But that doesn't mean it's cheap. We came up with $54,850 in extras, with one option accounting for more than half of the upcharges.
That pricey feature is Porsche's Paint To Sample Plus, available through the company's  Exclusive Manufaktur program. For $30,020, you can choose a custom color applied to the Taycan right from the factory. Otherwise, there are five no-cost color choices, including the lovely Purple Sky Metallic launch color shown above. Volcano Grey Metallic, Shade Green Metallic, White, and Black are your other choices. Pale Blue Metallic, lifted from the 911 Dakar, is $2,850. For our purposes of finding the most expensive Taycan Turbo GT on the planet, we opt for the Paint To Sample Plus in a handsome blue.
We also choose the not-so-handsome Full Taycan Design Wrap for $11,400, adding bold branding on either side with big ol' stripes cascading over the car. Frankly, the much smaller Taycan Exterior Decal Set for $1,210 looks better, but with an unlimited budget, we prefer to throw taste out the window.
Those two options take us most of the way to the $54,850 upcharge. More exterior tweaks like painted exterior mirrors, painted wheels, black door handles, and black badges add $2,570. An illuminated Porsche logo in the taillight strip is $460, and illuminated carbon fiber door sills with bespoke lettering are $3,070. The GT Interior Package with Voltage Blue accents is a $940 bump, and other features like snazzy pedals and custom-colored owner manuals are factored in, too.
That takes the Turbo GT's price to an eye-watering $284,845. But if we're truly checking every box, we must include the Porsche Experience Center Delivery. For $2,000, you can pick up your car from Porsche in either Atlanta or Los Angeles and have a VIP experience in the process. That takes us to the final price of $286,845.

Mercedes Will Keep Making Its Cheapest Gas Car Because EVs Are Still Expensive,https://www.motor1.com/news/711863/mercedes-a-class-production-extended/,"The A-Class was supposed to be retired in 2024, but not anymore.",12/25/2024 8:54,"Mercedes has been overly optimistic about the rise in popularity of electrified vehicles, claiming hybrids and EVs would account for 50 percent of its sales by 2025. However, that's unlikely to happen since the new goal for 2024 is to reach just 21 percent of total shipments. Facing the harsh reality, the German luxury marque will no longer kill off its cheapest gasoline car this year.
The A-Class was supposed to bow out in 2024 but now it has had its life cycle extended well into 2026, according to Autocar. Not sold in the United States, the compact hatchback is effectively the entry point into the Mercedes lineup, kicking off at €37,401 (nearly $41,000) in its domestic market Deutschland. Last month, CEO Ola Kallenius admitted price parity between combustion engine cars and pure electric models is still ""many years away."" The executive went on to mention that customers can see that in the price gap between an ICE car and an EV.
Mercedes is working on a new family of compact cars and those too will have combustion engines. The CLA, CLA Shooting Brake, GLA, and GLB are all getting replacements on a newly developed MMA platform that will support gas engines as well as entirely electric drivetrains. The company hasn't said a word about whether the A-Class hatchback, A-Class sedan, and the B-Class minivan will be renewed. We do know there are plans for a ""Little G"" SUV on this new architecture.
Mercedes thinks plug-in hybrids and EVs will represent up to 50 percent of total shipments by 2030. It's a big change compared to a projection made a couple of years ago when the firm said it would be completely electric in some markets by the end of the decade. Based on the newly established targets, we can deduce the company intends to keep making cars with gasoline engines in the 2030s as a response to a weaker-than-expected adoption of EVs.
In a document prepared for investors, the Stuttgart-based automaker says it's ""taking the necessary steps to go all electric"" but recognizes that ""customers and market conditions will set the pace of the transformation."" In other words, if you want to buy a gas car in 2031 with the famed three-pointed star, Mercedes will happily oblige.
There are signs the European Union's sales ban on new cars with emissions in 2035 might not actually come into effect. Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke recently said there are ""a lot of discussions right now around the end of the combustion engine. I think it could be delayed."" If that happens, which wouldn't come as a big shock, the ICE age will be prolonged.

Watch Porsche Reveal The Taycan Turbo GT: Livestream,https://www.motor1.com/news/711870/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-debut-livestream/,The livestream starts at 9 AM Eastern / 1 PM GMT.,12/25/2024 8:54,"Update: The livestream is over and the Taycan Turbo GT is here! Read all about it in our debut post packed with information and photos of this very potent EV.
The New Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: This Is It
The ""most dynamic Taycan of all time"" will go official later today as a more powerful version of Porsche's hot EV. Likely to gain the ""Turbo GT"" suffix, the high-performance electric sedan will have the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire in its crosshairs. It already has a feather in its cap by setting a Nürburgring lap record for purely electric models.
Porsche has been tight-lipped about the Taycan Turbo GT but the spy shots of virtually undisguised prototypes running around the 'Ring revealed a more aggressive body. The comprehensive aero package will include that look-at-me rear wing and more subtle tweaks for better airflow. The engineers from Zuffenhausen might have put the Taycan on a diet before sending it to the gym to build some muscle. It's a logical assumption since the Cayenne Turbo GT also got more power and lost weight.
We'll have to wait and see whether those rumors about a third motor will pan out, but even without it, combined output is likely to hit four digits, at least with a boost function. Look for neck-snapping acceleration since adding power while removing weight will likely enable a 0 to 60 mph run in the low two-second range. Odds are we're going to see the most powerful production Porsche ever, although a temporary title since the Mission X supercar has high chances of entering production.
Let's face it – the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT won't save our fragile planet with its electric drivetrain. The intent here is to show an EV can be more than just absurdly quick in a straight line. It can be fun to drive around a track despite what will certainly still be a lofty curb weight. Driving it at full tilt is going to drain the battery at a much higher rate but that's a sacrifice owners will be willing to make.
As to how much it’s going to cost, a 2025 Taycan Turbo S is already an eye-watering $210,995. Porsche is likely to charge at least an extra $20,000 for the new crown jewel of the lineup. With options, you'll likely end up spending a quarter of a million dollars.

How The Lunar Rover Batteries Worked—And Nearly Failed—On The Moon,https://www.motor1.com/features/711447/how-lunar-rover-batteries-work/,EV batteries hate extreme temps. So how did NASA build an electric rover that worked in outer space?,12/25/2024 8:54,"When manufacturers develop new powertrains, they frequently test them in the most extreme conditions on Earth. For example, the all-electric Rolls Royce Spectre was subjected to temperatures as low as -40F (-40C)  and as high as 122F (50C), so engineers could determine how its range would hold up in extremes. This harsh-climate exposure is crucial for BEVs, as batteries lose a lot of efficiency in freezing or scorching temperatures.
There is no climate on Earth, however, that compares to the intensity of the Moon. 250 degrees F (120C) during the day, -200 degrees F (-130C) at night, and that’s in the Moon’s temperate zones. So how did NASA manage to build an electric Moon rover that could operate in such extreme conditions, all the way back in the 1970s?
Although a Moon mission vehicle was in the works from the very beginning of the Apollo program, the first Moon rover—officially known as the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV)—wasn’t launched until the fourth manned Moon landing, Apollo 15, in 1971. The end goals for the LRV were simple: increase the area astronauts could explore, and help carry Moon rocks back to the lunar lander.
Spaceflight has a way of making simple demands challenging to meet, however.
The need to reduce the LRV’s weight required incredibly high-tech construction. Liberal use of aluminum and titanium got the LRV’s curb weight down to just 460 pounds, or roughly half that of a typical golf cart; Despite this, its payload was more than 1,000 pounds. It had to be foldable to stow on the lunar landing module; When launch-ready, it folded down to just 20 inches thick. It had zinc-plated, woven steel mesh wheels that could deform and spring back into shape, rather than pop or bend, to avoid blowouts on craggy rocks. Engineers gave it independent four-wheel-drive and four-wheel-steering for maximum traction and maneuverability.
Power demands were minimal, as the LRV would weigh just 76 pounds in the lighter gravitational field of the Moon. As such, it had just 1 total horsepower (.75 kilowatts), supplied via four quarter-horsepower series-wound DC motors (one at each wheel). Each motor had its own harmonic drive with an 80:1 gear reduction, to improve torque and response. The motor casings were pressurized to 7.5 PSI to prevent dust from entering the housings and ruining the brushes. Its official top speed was 8 MPH, although it cracked 11 MPH during Apollo 17 when astronaut Eugene Cernan floored it down a hill with a full payload of Moon rocks.
Originally, the budget for the LRV was just $19 million; cost overruns put the final tab at $38 million, making it the worst dollar-per-horsepower deal in history.
Because the LRV was low-power, it demanded a light, compact battery pack, rather than a large high-capacity one. Since it was intended to be a single-use machine (all three LRVs ever taken to the Moon are still parked on it), the batteries also didn’t need to be rechargeable. As such, a pair of 36V, 4.1-kilowatt-hour silver-zinc batteries were used—a far cry from the 80+ kWh battery packs of modern cars. Silver zinc batteries are only minimally rechargeable, lasting anywhere from 10-50 cycles. However, they possessed the highest energy density of any battery in existence prior to the development of lithium cells, at around 220 Wh/kg (vs. modern lithium-ion’s 270 Wh/kg). For single-use applications, they were unbeatable in the 1970s. As a result, silver-zinc served as the gold standard for aerospace batteries in both the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
Total usable range from the pair of batteries was rated at 57 miles during normal operation, with one battery powering the front wheels, and one powering the rear. The twin-battery design was built for redundancy, so if one battery died, the other could still power the entire LRV. This reduced safe usable range. NASA planners also wouldn’t allow astronauts to drive the LRV further away from the lander than they could walk, in case of a complete breakdown. This limited it to a six-mile radius of operations. The furthest an LRV was ever driven on a single mission was the final manned Moon landing, Apollo 17, where astronauts covered roughly 22 miles during the three-day expedition (including one continuous 12-mile drive).
In a decades-later interview with Wired, astronaut (and rover driver) Charles Duke recalled that on Apollo 16, despite driving the LRV over 15 miles, “we didn't even come close to running out of power.”
Temperature control was, unexpectedly, challenging. Silver zinc batteries perform poorly in cold temperatures, but the LRV was only intended for use during the 15-Earth-day-long lunar daytime, which meant that keeping them from overheating was the primary concern. The lunar surface itself can reach temperatures hotter than boiling water during these fortnight-long days, but since the Moon has no atmosphere, local temperatures vary wildly and are primarily determined by time spent directly in sunlight. The battery’s maximum operating temperature was rated at 125F (52C) and maximum survival temperature was 140F (60C), which it would rapidly exceed if exposed to broad daylight for too long.
This was easily solved during transit: the LRV was stored folded flat on the outside of the lunar lander. The lander would slowly rotate like a rotisserie chicken as it orbited the Moon, evenly distributing direct sunlight to each side, keeping temperatures manageable. On the surface of the Moon, however, there was no hiding from the rays of the sun, and the batteries would rapidly exceed their 140F limit.
To solve this, both batteries were given passive radiators. Rather than using a traditional active liquid cooling system, engineers used fused-silica mirrors to reflect as much light—and remove as much heat—as physically possible. When the LRV was moving, the mirrors would be covered with a dust shield, to prevent the extremely fine lunar soil from coating the mirrors, which would ruin their ability to reflect light and radiate heat.
This worked… to an extent. On Apollo 15, short trips and a low Sun angle kept the batteries within normal temperatures, but on Apollo 16, the landing location had higher temperatures. Making matters worse, an early accident meant the LRV lost a fender. A rooster-tail of fine dust followed the rover everywhere it went, and it coated everything—including the mirrors. The batteries refused to cool off in between drives, even after removing the heat shields and brushing off the mirrors, as the lunar soil retained heat too efficiently. The batteries could be slightly cooled by parking the LRV in the shade, but if it stayed in the shade for too long, the extreme cold would kill other electrical components.
Mission Control had astronauts switch from one battery to the other for power supply, trying to let each one cool off for longer periods. Despite this, by the final excursion on the third day of Apollo 16, the LRV batteries exceeded their maximum survival temperature, reaching 143F (62C) by the end of the mission. Luckily, the LRV batteries worked fine despite the scorching temperatures, and no astronauts had to walk home. On Apollo 17, careful dust control and parking the LRV further away from the Lunar Landing Module—which radiated immense amounts of heat—kept battery temperatures within acceptable ranges.
While NASA has planned humanity’s return to the Moon with the Artemis project, there’s no official word on which car is going up next, although there are many contenders—one of which is an Ultium-powered, GM/Lockheed joint project. While the future of Ultium is still in the air, it’s likely whatever vehicle traverses the moon next will use lithium-ion batteries just like terrestrial EVs, with similar temperature management strategies. It’s probable the new rover will have remote-control capabilities, as well, like the NASA VIPER Moon rover probe set to launch later this year.
The one thing that engineers will still need to contend with, no matter what? Dust… dust never changes.

The New Rivian R2 Gets A Kitchen And A Rooftop Tent,https://www.motor1.com/news/711633/rivian-r2-accessories-features/,Other nifty features include a dual glovebox and a flashlight.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Rivian delivered an unexpected one-two punch yesterday at the unveiling of the R2 where it took everyone by surprise with the even smaller R3. However, the first order of business is to kick off deliveries of its long-awaited Tesla Model Y rival, but that won't happen until the first half of 2026. When it does eventually hit the streets, the R2 will be compatible with a series of nifty accessories.
Much like the bigger R1T pickup and R1S SUV, the latest entry in Rivian's growing lineup caters to outdoorsy people with a bunch of optional goodies. For example, the Travel Kitchen bundles a water tank, a cooler, an induction cooktop with additional storage and even a cookware set. Rivian will throw in some hanging lights for when you're cooking at night in the middle of nowhere.
Alternatively, the small kitchen can make way for a detachable cargo box with handles on the sides and tiny wheels to carry it around. It's good for items that would otherwise make a mess inside the car, kind of like a tiny portable pickup truck bed. The interior is also great at storing stuff since not only you can fold flat the rear bench but also both front seats. Oh, and there's a front trunk as well.
What else? The cargo box on the roof is nothing to write home about but Rivian can swap it for a so-called Treehouse. It's a boxy rooftop tent that comes bundles with a ladder for ease of access. Installed at the rear, the bike mount is hooked up to the R2 without having to use tools and it can store two bikes. While some cars have built-in umbrella holders in the driver's door, the electric SUV uses that space for a flashlight.
Although undoubtedly an interesting EV, the new Rivian R2 will sadly take its sweet time to hit the market. It’s especially true in Europe (including the UK) where it won't go on sale until 2027. In the United States, prices will start at around $45,000 but you'll be paying more for these accessories. Logic tells us the Euro version will be more expensive given the value-added tax (VAT).
There's An Even Smaller Rivian On The Way;",Adrian Padeanu
BMW Might Make Gas And Electric M3s At The Same Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/711596/bmw-m3-ice-and-electric/,A new report says that reduced regulatory pressure has allowed the German automaker to pursue two very different drivetrains.,12/25/2024 8:55,"BMW is in the process of electrifying its entire lineup. It's safe to assume, then, that the M3, its flagship sports sedan, will lose its internal combustion engine in the near future. Indeed, that seems to have been the plan not long ago, however now a report indicates some changes behind the scenes. A new ICE M3 is reportedly on the way, and it will exist alongside an electric model.
There's a lot of interesting details in BMW Blog's report. It claims the electric and ICE M3 will reportedly not share a platform, for instance. The report also says the M4 coupe will also allegedly be electric only. In other words, the sedan may be the only option for those who want straight-six power.
The plan, says BMW Blog, is to use the current 3.0-liter S58 engine for the next car, as it will still be emissions-compliant. This means power output in the neighborhood of 500 horsepower or more, but it's very unlikely the new car will have a manual transmission. BMW M's brass seems eager to get rid of pesky clutch pedals as soon as they can.
BMW has shown us a quad-motor electric M car before, but we've heard nothing since a short teaser was released several months ago. At that time, it was likely that the German automaker thought this would be the only drivetrain offered in a potential new M3, however reduced regulatory pressure has reportedly changed the picture.
Several countries have pushed back ICE bans, and stringent emissions regulations have been hit with loopholes or watered down entirely. The European Union carved out a provision that allows ICE cars to be powered by synthetic fuels, for instance. It's also been reported that upcoming EPA regulations have been cut back following pressure from the automotive industry.
With all of this in mind it makes sense BMW will still offer an ICE-powered M3, especially if it's using the same engine as the current generation. All of this should be taken with a grain of salt, of course, but it could mean that internal combustion's relevance, at least in terms of performance cars, could last well into the 2030s.

Rivian's New Battery Cell Could Be Even Better Than Tesla's,https://www.motor1.com/news/711578/rivian-r2-battery-cells-details/,The new Rivian R2 SUV features huge cylindrical batteries which are even larger than the advanced 4680 cells used by Tesla.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Rivian surprised everyone today by not only revealing the hotly-anticipated R2 SUV at a starting price of just $45,000, but also showing us another car, the R3, as well as a new battery cell that underpins both cars. The cell is called the 4695 due to its diameter of 46 millimeters and height of 95 millimeters. Its specs have yet to be detailed, but it's considerably larger than Tesla's 4680 cells, which could mean a lot.
As battery cells get bigger their voltage does not change unless the chemistry changes, and Rivian is more likely than not using conventional lithium-ion chemistry. What does increase is the cell's rating in amp-hours, which translates into a 4695 holding more energy than a 4680. But there's more.
Larger cells can typically charge and discharge at higher rates. In short, this means the R2 will likely be able to charge faster and offer more peak power than if it got its juice from a slightly slimmer pack made of 4680s. The car's regenerative braking can also be stronger, which may offer efficiency gains.
Rivian is not the first to get into the 4695 game. BMW recently revealed samples of a 4695 cell it plans to use in its Neue Klasse of EVs from 2025 onwards. Indeed, several battery manufacturers are now producing cells in this 46mm form factor, including Samsung SDI, Panasonic, and LG.
We don't know the exact specs of these new 4695 cells, but we can do a little bit of guestimation about the pack's specs based on images Rivian showed us at the reveal.
Zooming in on the pack, it appears to consist of 3 large modules separated by heavy internal frame rails. Each module is 34 cells wide by 8 deep, for a total content of 272 cells. If we're talking lithium-ion and we assume the cells are all wired in series, we get a module voltage of 979.2V (nominal). That's a 1000V architecture, not 800V as speculation might otherwise indicate.
With three of these modules wired in parallel, the voltage will remain the same but the current available will go up considerably. We don't know what the individual cell ratings are, but other 4695s are capable of pulse discharging at up to 10C, or ten times their rated capacity in amp-hours. This could mean available power as high as 900kW, or around 1,200 horsepower. The Rivian's 4695s likely err on the side of capacity, though, so such high discharge rates are unlikely.
Once the electric automaker unveils the total capacity of the pack, that sort of information can be extrapolated. For now, just know that these new battery cells will likely enable performance on par if not greater than what Tesla is capable of in cars like the Model Y. How efficiently the rest of the drivetrain uses this energy is going to matter in terms of real-world performance, but the kilowatt-hours are there for the taking.

Dodge Says It Doesn't Care About The Charger Daytona's Efficiency Or Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/711242/dodge-charger-daytona-efficency-range/,"Dodge boss Tim Kuniskis says muscle-car owners don't care about efficiency. That said, the Charger Daytona is surprisingly efficient.",12/25/2024 8:55,"The Dodge Charger goes electric with the new Daytona model, but it is still unashamedly a muscle car. At a preview event for the Charger Daytona, Dodge head Tim Kuniskis told gathered media ""I don’t care. This is about performance,"" when asked about range and efficiency.
""Muscle car owners don’t care about fuel economy,"" he added. That said, the EPA range figures for the Charger Daytona are solid. The Charger Daytona R/T promises a 317-mile range from its 100.5-kWh gross (93.4-kWh net) battery pack, while the more powerful Scat Pack should do 260 miles on a full charge. Your milage may obviously vary – especially if you take advantage of the Daytona's donut mode – but that's an average figure of 3.4 miles/kWh for the R/T and 2.78 mi/kWh for the Scat Pack. Not bad for vehicles that weigh 5,838 pounds and offer 496 and 670 horsepower, respectively.
Charging rate is impressive too. The Charger Daytona uses a 400-volt electrical architecture, which usually translates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW, but it seems like it uses the trick of virtually splitting the battery pack into two virtual units charging in parallel, boosting speeds. The maximum rate of 183 kW is achievable at 350-kW stations.
So maybe Dodge didn't care about range or efficiency, but accidentally made an efficient car with a respectable range. All the more impressive given the power, size, and huge weight of the thing.
But we have to agree with Kuniskis here. We doubt muscle-car buyers will care.

Volkswagen Sued Twice As Felicity Ace Cargo Ship Fire Might Have Started From A Porsche,https://www.motor1.com/news/711302/vw-lawsuit-felicity-ace/,Plaintiffs claim a battery from a Porsche sparked the fire.,12/25/2024 8:55,"In February 2022, the Felicity Ace cargo ship caught fire and ultimately sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Some 4,000 cars perished in the fiery incident, most of which were new vehicles from various Volkswagen Group brands. But the drama isn't over; the German juggernaut is facing not one but two lawsuits.
Bloomberg reports that VW Group has been sued twice over allegations the fire started from a lithium-ion battery pack inside a Porsche that was on its way to a customer. Felicity Ace caught fire near the Azores archipelago while carrying an estimated $155 million worth of high-end cars, including 1,110 Porsches. Plaintiffs claim one of those cars sparked the fire that subsequently generated a veritable cartastrophe.
One of the lawsuits was filed in a court in Stuttgart where Porsche calls home. The lawsuit is led by the cargo ship's operator, Mitsui OSK Lines, and Felicity Ace's insurer, Allianz. Interestingly, this lawsuit was filed over a year ago, but its progression has been halted due to mediation talks for a second lawsuit in a Brunswick court, located in Lower Saxony, Germany.
Additional discussions between the involved parties are scheduled for later this month. If a settlement is not reached, the lawsuits will resume. According to documents related to the initial 2023 lawsuit, the plaintiffs accuse VW of withholding information about the risks associated with transporting electrified cars. Moreover, the lawsuit filed in the Stuttgart court alleges that VW failed to disclose the necessary precautions for safely transporting the cars.
Bloomberg reports the fire started from a Porsche EV, which can only be the Taycan. However, it's worth noting the automaker also sells a variety of Cayenne and Panamera versions with plug-in hybrid powertrains that have smaller battery packs. Parent company VW has confirmed the two lawsuits while Mitsui OSK Lines and Allianz refused to comment on the matter.
Attached below is an incomplete list of the VW Group cars that perished that day. There were also many privately owned vehicles that went under together with Felicity Ace. Notable mentions include a 2015 Ford Mustang GT, a Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0, a 2007 BMW 750i, and even a JDM-spec 1996 Honda Prelude SiR. In addition, there was a 1977 Land Rover Santana, which was built in Spain under license from Land Rover by using complete knock-down kits of the Defender.
As a reminder, Lamborghini had to restart production of the Aventador to replace the 15 Ultimae units lost on the burned and sunken cargo ship.

2025 Tesla Roadster: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/710485/tesla-roadster-speed-horsepower-range-price/,It’s been a long time coming—but the new Roadster might finally be on the way.,12/25/2024 8:55,"The second-generation Tesla Roadster debuted way back in November 2017. But it’s still not for sale, as the brand continues to work on the project. The latest statements from CEO Elon Musk indicate that deliveries could begin in 2025, and he touts some impressive—bordering on unbelievable—stats for the new model.
We’ll have to wait and see if the new Roadster actually debuts this year and if those 2025 delivery targets will come true. Until then, here’s everything we know about the electric sports car ahead of its debut.
The Roadster was Tesla’s first model ever, with production running from 2008 through 2012. But at that time it was just a Lotus Elise with batteries and it had a relatively limited production run. Tesla sold just over 2,400 models in its five-year production run.
Five years later the company announced a second-generation model was under development. Elon even showed a concept of the vehicle’s design. At that time, Musk claimed the new Roadster was able to reach 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds, with a top speed of over 250 miles per hour and a 620-mile range. Prices started at $200,000, and deliveries were supposed to begin in 2020.
There have been several reports about the second-gen Roadster’s powertrain over the years, and it has evolved in that time. The latest reports indicate that the Roadster may have a 200.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack and three electric motors—one up front and two on the rear. That would give the supercar well over 1,000 horsepower. Musk said that the Roadster would reportedly have 7,376 pound-feet of torque—but that number is misleading. It will probably have closer to 758 lb-ft.
In 2019, Musk said the sports car would be available with 10 rocket thrusters that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking, and cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly,"" according to the company boss. In 2021, Musk said the car would hit 60 mph in 1.1 seconds with the optional rockets.
During a 2021 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Musk went into more detail about the flying Roadster. ""I thought maybe we could make it hover, but not too high,"" he said. ""So maybe it could hover, like, a meter above the ground, or something. So, if you plummet, you blow out the suspension, but you’re not going to die.""
CEO Elon Musk claims the Tesla Roadster will be able to hit 60 miles per hour in less than one second. On February 28, 2024, he posted new details about the second-generation Roadster on X with the claim. He also wrote, ""Tonight, we radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster. There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""
To put this acceleration into perspective, the Rimac Nevera set a production-car record in 2023, reaching 60 mph in 1.74 seconds. Students in Switzerland built an open-wheel EV that hit 60 mph in 0.956 seconds but was far from a road-legal vehicle.
Rimac CEO Mate Rimac backed up Elon’s claim—somewhat—by saying that 0-60 mph in under one second ""is possible,"" but that ""thrusters are really the only way to go.""
The Tesla Roadster will reportedly have a top speed of over 250 miles per hour, a claim originally made in 2019.
Tesla has released multiple photos of the new Roadster and even put it on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Musk said the production design is complete in the recent series of tweets. Although, that statement might indicate that the final sports car might look different than in the earlier images.
The previous photos show a sports car that looks radically different from the first-gen Roadster. The new one has a sharp-edged, low-slung shape with pointy headlights. Rather than being a true convertible, there’s a removable roof panel over the occupants. Inside, the driver grips a steering yoke. A curved tablet between the seats handles the instrument and infotainment duties in a layout similar to other Tesla vehicles.
In the series of Tweets where Musk announced the sub-1 second 0-60-mph time, he also mentioned showing the final design at the end of the year and beginning deliveries in 2025. When the second-gen Roadster originally debuted in 2017, it was initially supposed to go on sale in 2020. Tesla has been pushing back the vehicle’s launch every year since then.
Since the 2017 debut, Tesla has maintained the new Roadster would start at $200,000, and there would be a $250,000 Founders Series version. There’s no info available yet about what the rocket-equipped version would cost—but it will likely be even pricier.
Until 2021, Tesla took $50,000 reservations for the new Roadster. At that time, the company removed the vehicle’s price from its site and stopped accepting bookings for the sports car.
In 2022, popular YouTuber Marques Brownlee released a video complaining about the new Roadster’s multiple delays. He was frustrated about Tesla announcing the model and then pushing back the introduction for years.

The New Karma Gyesera EV Already Looks Familiar,https://www.motor1.com/news/710942/karma-gyesera-debut-specs/,Karma's first electric sedan promises 250 miles of range.,12/25/2024 8:55,"This year marks Karma Automotive's 10th anniversary. With that the company debuted the Gyesera—an evolution of the GSe-6, a fully electric sedan revealed in 2021. The GSe-6 had a design reminiscent of the plug-in hybrid Revero launched in 2016, which superseded the short-lived Fisker Karma introduced in 2011.
But the Gyesera hopes to be more than just a remix. Karma President Marques McCammon told Automotive News that almost all body panels are new compared to the Revero. Only a section of the rear quarter panels has been carried over. Even still, the styling looks familiar. The body is made from a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber on a spaceframe chassis made from aluminum.
Changes have been made to about 85 percent of the car, added McCammon. Karma Vice President, Global Design Michelle Christensen goes as far as to say it's ""the most badass GT on the road."" The new Gyesera is 199.9 inches long, 78.9 inches wide, and 52.4 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 124.4 inches. To put those numbers into perspective, it's 3.9 inches longer and 1.6 inches wider than a Tesla Model S but rides 4.5 inches lower to the ground.
The rear-wheel-drive Karma Gyesera aims to deliver 590 horsepower and 693 pound-feet of torque to enable a 0-60 mph run in less than 4.2 seconds and a top speed of over 135 mph. The specs sheet reveals a curb weight of 5,300 pounds. Mind you, these are preliminary figures based on simulations and early testing, so the numbers could change until production starts. There's a 120.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for over 250 miles, but the range is also a projection.
Karma Automotive intends to start production before the end of this year but doesn't rule out an early 2025 market launch. The electric sedan will be a limited-run affair since only approximately 2,000 units will be made during a production run of four or five years.
It's going to cost between $175,000 and $225,000, according to Automotive News. That's going to make it a lot more expensive than a Tesla Model S (from $74,990), a Porsche Taycan (from $99,400), a Mercedes EQS (from $104,400), or an Audi E-Tron GT (from $106,500).
Introduced this weekend at the Amelia Island Concours, the Gyesera can already be preordered for $5,000. The new sedan follows last year's introduction of the Kaveya electric coupe slated to go on sale in the final quarter of 2025 as the brand's flagship car. Meanwhile, an updated plug-in hybrid Revero is expected to hit the assembly line in Q3 2024.

Hardcore Porsche Taycan Arrives March 11,https://www.motor1.com/news/710990/hardcore-porsche-taycan-teaser/,It's likely the hot version that lapped the Nurburgring in 7:07.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Porsche has officially started the countdown for its most hardcore Taycan yet. The world premiere is scheduled for March 11 when we'll discover the ""most dynamic Taycan of all time."" Marketing jargon aside, this hot electric sedan is likely a production version of a prototype that lapped Nordschleife in 7:07.55.
Having slashed 26 seconds from the Taycan Turbo S' lap time and 17.6 seconds from the Tesla Model S Plaid's hot lap of the Green Hell, the hardcore Taycan will be bloody fast. The new teaser image released today only shows a shadowy silhouette—but the car from the Nürburgring bared all. The big wing at the back will set it apart from the lesser derivatives, although we're sure Porsche has made other aero tweaks that we'll discover next week.
The most potent Taycan so far is the Turbo S with 938 horsepower, already a huge bump considering the old one had 750 hp. You can expect the future flagship to pack an even greater punch, possibly exceeding the 1,000-hp mark to match the Plaid with its monstrous 1,020-hp output. Neck-snapping acceleration is a given considering the new Turbo S already does 0 to 62 mph in just 2.4 seconds, down by 0.4s compared to the old Turbo S.
The car's name remains a mystery, although some are referring to the crown jewel as the Taycan Turbo GT. Another missing piece of the puzzle is the number of electric motors since various reports state Porsche's engineers are cramming a third motor. However, take these details with the proverbial pinch of salt.
A third motor would add weight to an already heavy car, although Zuffenhausen might try to offset the extra bulk by putting the electric sedan on a diet. For reference, a Taycan Turbo S weighs 5,082 pounds in the United States.
With the facelift introduced about a month ago, Porsche increased pricing across the lineup. The Taycan Turbo S is now $14,445 more expensive than before, kicking off at $210,995. It’s safe to assume the Turbo GT or whatever it'll be called is going to command a serious premium. Don't be too surprised if it'll cost roughly $250,000 or about the same as a Lucid Air Sapphire. An AMG EQS starts at $147,550 while the Plaid is a bargain by comparison, at $89,990. However, whether Tesla is a luxury brand or not, that's up for debate.

This Secret Ford F-150 Lightning Will Climb Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/710790/ford-f-150-lightning-demonstrator-pikes-peak/,It could be a modified version of the F-150 Lightning Switchgear we saw earlier this year.,12/25/2024 8:55,"During Ford's big party in Charlotte to kick off the 2024 racing season, company CEO Jim Farley revealed a new ""EV demonstrator"" would tackle Pikes Peak. Details on that vehicle weren't mentioned, and for the most part, they still aren't mentioned. However, we at least know it will be an F-150 Lightning. But it won't anything you'll see at the local Ford dealership.
Ford shared a single teaser image on social media on Friday, showing the front of a vehicle hiding under covers. It's low, wide, and there's a wild wing at the back like the one on the bonkers electric SuperVan. In fact, if Ford didn't specifically say this was an F-150 Lightning, our minds would jump directly to some SuperVan iteration beyond the current 4.2 model. But this is a truck, and clearly, Ford is applying some of the lessons learned from its supremely fast van.
This hillclimb racer could be a variation of the Lightning Switchgear, a one-off prototype designed to explore performance envelopes both on- and off-road for the electric truck. We got up close with the Switchgear back in January, taking a ride in the off-road version with Vaughn Gittin Jr. at the wheel. It's called Switchgear because the same truck – with small changes to the suspension and tires – is designed to tackle paved corners the same way it tackles dirt jumps.
Ford didn't make two versions of the Switchgear, however. The same prototype accommodates both roles, which means we only saw the off-road version in person. During the event, a Ford rep told us it would be converted at a later date, which would be convenient timing for Pikes Peak.
The above rendering comes from Ford's Switchgear press kit, showing how the street version should look. Obviously there are quite a few differences between this and the teaser, notably that big wing and what could be strakes from the cab to the back, not unlike what we see on the SuperVan. If this new Lightning demonstrator is based on Switchgear, Ford is certainly taking it to the extreme.
Whether it's related to Switchgear or something completely different, we suspect this F-150 will be pretty darned quick going up the hill. This year's Pikes Peak Hillclimb is June 23, so expect more on this amped-up Lightning between now and then.

"Mate Rimac Says 0-60 MPH In One Second 'Is Possible,' But There’s A Catch",https://www.motor1.com/news/710679/rimac-tesla-0-60-one-second/,"The Bugatti-Rimac CEO says Tesla's claim of 0-60 mph in under one second is possible, but it requires tons of power and very little weight.",12/25/2024 8:55,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a radical claim earlier this week about the upcoming Roadster supercar, saying the company is aiming for a 0-60 mph time of less than one second. While many have since dismissed the claim, he does have an ally in Bugatt-Rimac CEO Mate Rimac—sort of.
When asked on his Facebook page if he thought the under-one-second claim was believable, Rimac responded with a surprising yes. ""It is possible with thrusters,"" he says in the Facebook comment. ""We did the simulation.""
But there is a significant stipulation to go along with that confirmation.
""Problem is, you release the air in two to three seconds and then you have a lot of dead weight that you are carrying around (tanks, compressor, valves, nozzles etc.),"" Rimac continues. ""Same with fans—they just give you more grip but you need something like 30,000 newton-meters on the wheels to accelerate below one sec 0-100 km/h, which means you need massive motors, inverters, gearboxes, driveshafts, etc.""
Rimac also notes that the car has to be ""super light,"" which isn’t typically the standard for battery-powered cars. Even his Rimac Nevera hypercar—which will hit 60 mph in under 2.0 seconds—weighs over 5,000 pounds.
""So thrusters are really the only way to go,"" he says. ""But they bring a lot of downsides as well.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested in 2018 that the Roadster would have ""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around the car."" That, in theory, would be the type of thrust the Roadster needs to achieve that sub-one-second 0-60 time. Although, it’s unclear how that would fare with the NHTSA.
We’ll have to wait and see if Elon’s claims come true. The new Tesla Roadster will reportedly debut later this year.

Our Homemade Honda Motocompacto Type R Is A Little Too Fast,https://www.motor1.com/features/710479/honda-motocompacto-type-r-drive/,Maybe tripling the power was a bit much.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Haven’t you heard? We built our own Honda Motocompacto scooter. It’s dimensionally identical to the real thing and uses many legit Honda parts, but it’s a lot faster than stock. Or at least, it will be by the time this story ends. It’s a Motocompacto Type R.
If you haven’t read the first story, I recommend doing so before this one. This piece mostly covers the driving experience and related subjects. The other story details the building of the Motocompacto Type R; how we made the chassis; how we got a Motocompacto motor; how it all came together.
The first big item was getting a battery mounted in the scooter’s body. It’s a little narrow in there, but there’s otherwise plenty of space. The stock Motocompacto battery is a 36-volt (nominal) unit of around 250 watt-hours. That’s a nice capacity for a scooter, but I didn’t want to use it, not only because there’s likely a performance-limiting management system wired into it, but also because the assembly is around $300 from Honda, which is really expensive for a pack of that capacity. Instead I started with a battery I knew well: one ripped out of a Hoverboard.
These 36V packs can put out around 40 amps of current for a while before they get unhappy. They only contain 155Wh of energy, but the price is right at just $40. Full of 18650 cells, they’re a common choice for scooters, e-bikes, and other light electric vehicles. Their only real downside is they have pretty bad voltage sag under load, which effectively gives the scooter a little less power than if it were using a larger battery. All you need to know for now is that there are many fun ways to solve that problem which we’ll explore later.
I installed the hoverboard pack and wired up the throttle. Then, I routed the mechanical brake. Eventually, I want to get rid of this brake by utilizing very strong regen, but for now I figured I might as well put it in. When all of that was done I added the headlight. I used a sodium-ion 18650 cell to power it. I bought a bunch of sodium-ion batteries a while ago out of curiosity and decided to use one for this purpose. This is not the last time you’ll see them.
I weighed the scooter before riding it. At 37.2 pounds, it’s about 4 pounds lighter than the factory version. With that in mind, I set the current to 14 amps which would give me a stock amount of Motocompacto power. Having never built something this light before, I didn’t know what to expect in terms of acceleration.
And it was very slow. I haven’t driven a stock Motocompacto, but let’s just say I’m pleased that I’m able to alter this one’s output. At 490W, this thing could barely handle the gentle grade of my driveway. I guess that shouldn’t be surprising for ⅔ horsepower, but I was expecting more.
So I turned it up to one horsepower, which was a little better. At this amount of current, the stock scooter would blow its internal fuse. 745W was still not enough, though. I wanted this thing to take off and accelerate hard.
I went back into the garage and did a quick health check on the scooter, which meant I looked around to make sure nothing was smoking. Bad for people as well as electronics. Nothing was even warm, so I turned it up to 40 amps. That’s about the max these batteries are willing to provide and would give me 1,440W, which is about two horsepower.
When electric motors receive too much current they generally get hot and make a sort of TV static squealing noise, at least in my experience. If you’ve ever driven a turbocharged car that breaks up under boost, it kind of feels like that. You want it to go faster but it just isn’t having it.
Anyway, this one did that. At full throttle it really complained, the phase wires to the motor were getting warm, and the whole thing was generally not having a great time. In my experience, around 35A is really the end of the world for these kinds of small hub motors. So I turned it down to 35A and mellowed out the throttle curve. That made it just right.
I was really enjoying it, and on the way back to the garage it stopped accelerating very suddenly. As it turns out, the little clips used to keep the motor shaft from spinning had been sheared wide open by the newfound torque. The sudden jolt unplugged the motor from the rest of the scooter. I bent everything back into place and now it’s fine. I’ve since redesigned the clips. You can see how much weaker the old ones were. As a rookie scooter designer, I’ll take that one on the chin. As a side note, future runs will include a helmet.
The increased torque has also revealed that the tolerances on my front end are a little loose. When you go wide open, you can physically feel the fork trying to pull itself off the scooter. Maybe that part shouldn’t be plastic. Speed wobbles are a problem too, but I’m not sure if that’s specific to my design or more a result of the minuscule 29.2” wheelbase and very small amount of caster angle. Improvements are on the way in that department as well.
The whole reason I did this project is customizability, and you’ll be seeing more on that front. We’ll be able to change out the batteries, alter the “tune” on the drivetrain, and modify the hardware to get a better end product. Since we did this whole deal from the ground up, anything is possible.
I kinda wish I could’ve just bought a stock Motocompacto to do all of this, though. I understand the Honda isn’t supposed to be a dangerous toy with a hair-trigger throttle, but that should ultimately be up to the owner to decide. A lot of enthusiasts find electric vehicles unappealing because manufacturers lock them out of the tinkering and tuning process. That’s silly when altering the performance of an EV is as simple as a few keystrokes on a laptop. Maybe I’m drifting out of my lane here, but if you want people to like your toys, they have to be able to play with them. The Motocompacto in particular doesn’t even run at a deadly level of voltage.
Critiques aside, this thing is still fun to ride and surprisingly practical. Even without folding, it fits handily in the back of my car. The large square body also provides a lot of space inside for storage, or a rat’s nest of wiring in my case.
I think there are many potential modifications here, and as soon as the next piece of the puzzle arrives, the Motocompacto Type R will return. I want to do a top-speed run, but I need to mentally prepare myself for that and tighten up the steering. If you want to see anything else in particular, leave a comment and we’ll consider trying it. More riding footage is on the way, too. The weather has not been kind lately.

The New Renault 5 Gets Branded Merch Like This Rad Cassette Player,https://www.motor1.com/news/710553/renault-5-branded-merch/,There's also a slot car track and a foosball table.,12/25/2024 8:55,"There's more to the chic Renault 5 than its baguette holder and lipstick-shaped gear shifter. The French marque is pulling out all the stops to make the R5's revival more interesting with an online shop chock-full of branded merchandise, and some items are cool as hell.
The one that initially caught our attention was the cassette player, which was all the rage when the previous-generation Renault 5 launched. Made from aluminum and fitted with headphone and microphone jacks, the Player5 Portable Cassette Player has Bluetooth and a play/record function. The rechargeable battery lasts for up to 10 hours and Renault throws in a blank 60-minute cassette. Oh, you also get a pencil to rewind the tape—which is a sentence that only makes sense if you're past a certain age. All for €180, which works out to about $195 at current exchange rates.
You can also buy a nifty slot car race track that's nearly 150 inches long. It comes bundled with 1:43 scale models of the 2021 Renault 5 prototype that came before the production version and the rad Turbo 3E concept. Both have working headlights and a turbo function with a dedicated button on the controllers. It'll set you back €115 ($125).
Another product that we found interesting is a €200 ($217) helmet with built-in brake light and turn signals. Alternatively, you could go for a €110 ($119) set of three stainless steel balls to play a game of pétanque. Per Wikipedia:
""Players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball. In pétanque, the objective is to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent after all boules have been thrown.

Aside from miscellaneous items such as beanies, sweaters, socks, skateboards, pencils, pedal cars, and scale models of various sizes, there are a few pricey goodies. You can spend a cool €2,700 ($2,930) on a bicycle or €3,000 ($3,250) on a surfboard. Reach deeper into your pockets for a foosball table that costs a whopping €4,200 ($4,500). It's made by French football table manufacturer Bonzini and weighs 176 pounds (80 kilograms).
As for the car itself, Renault has said the reborn 5 will kick off at around €25,000 ($27,000). A more expensive hot hatch derivative will follow later this year when Alpine is going to introduce the A290.

Hyundai Kills All N Gasoline Performance Cars In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/710383/hyundai-retires-i20n-i30n-europe/,"Just like that, Hyundai's hot hatches are no more in Europe.",12/25/2024 8:55,"Pour one out for Hyundai's gasoline fun cars in Europe. In a statement made to Motor1 Deutschland, a spokesperson for the company's German division confirmed production of N models that feed on gasoline on the Old Continent will end during the first half of 2024. It effectively means the i20 N, i30 N, and the lesser-known i30 N Fastback are being axed. However, if you hurry, there might be a few available in stock.
""Hyundai Motor has decided to cease production of ICE N models for the European market during the first half of the year. This follows the brand's commitment to offer European customers a zero-emission product range by 2035 and to be 100 percent carbon neutral in all phases of car production and operation by 2045. In Germany, the versions of the i20 N and i30 N are still shown in the configurator on hyundai.de and will continue to be available in dealerships this year (until probably the end of the year depending on the numbers available in stock).""
Europeans never got the latest Veloster N or the Elantra N for that matter. The new-generation Kona has yet to receive the N treatment as the range currently tops out with the N-Line model. High-performance N models are not going away in other markets considering Hyundai has already confirmed plans for a new Elantra N sedan, possibly with a bigger engine. The demise of sporty ICE models in Europe won't spell the end for N since there's now a fully electric Ioniq 5 N, with a Ioniq 6 N rumored to arrive in the foreseeable future.
With emissions regulations getting stricter and taxation on gasoline cars increasing basically every year, it's no wonder Hyundai Europe is pulling the plug on conventionally powered N cars. These models haven't even been around for a long time taking into account the i30 N first came out in 2017, followed in 2018 by the i30 N Fastback and in 2020 by the i20 N.
The days of affordable ICE performance cars in Europe are sadly numbered. Volkswagen has already killed the up! GTI and Polo GTI while the latest Golf GTI doesn't have a manual gearbox anymore. The days of Opel's OPC cars and Peugeot's GTi models are long gone. In addition, Ford killed the Fiesta ST in 2023 and will also axe the Focus ST in 2025.
Europeans also had diesel performance cars from mainstream brands, but the Golf GTD and the oil-burner Octavia RS have recently been canned.

"Watch Ford's 1,400-HP SuperVan Blast Its Way To Several Lap Records At Bathurst",https://www.motor1.com/news/710151/ford-supervan-sets-new-course-record-at-mount-panorama/,The electric van is even quicker around the course than Mercedes' specially prepped AMG GT3.,12/25/2024 8:55,"The Ford SuperVan 4.2 EV chalked up a few more records to add to the one-off model's already impressive resume by setting a blistering pace around the Mount Panorama circuit this past weekend. It now holds the titles for the quickest closed-wheel vehicle, electric vehicle, and commercial model around the 3.85-mile course that hosts the Bathurst 500 race.
The SuperVan 4.2's record-setting lap was 1 minute and 56.3247 seconds. To put this time into perspective, Mercedes touted setting a new fastest time earlier during the Bathurst 500 festivities when a specially modified AMG GT3 went around the circuit in 1:56.605, 0.2803 seconds slower than Ford's electric van.
The SuperVan 4.2 was driven to the finish line by Two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Romain Dumas. He's no stranger to scoring achievements like this, including setting the fastest times at courses like the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Nürburgring Nordschleife, and Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb in the Volkswagen I.D. R.
Last year, Dumas and the SuperVan 4.2 set a new record in the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb's Open Class by completing the 12.5-mile course in 8:47.682 to beat the previous quickest time of 9:24.433. The company also went to the Goodwood Festival of Speed with the SuperVan 4.0.
The SuperVan 4.2 is an evolution of the earlier 4.0 version, with a new carbon-fiber front splitter and rear spoiler to increase downforce. The three electric motors – one at the front and two at the rear – make a total of over 1,400 horsepower. The design is based roughly on the Ford e-Transit Custom, but the overhauled rear with massive openings in the bodywork are unlike anything you'd see on the road.
The SuperVan 4.2 will also be on display at the Adelaide Festival of Speed from March 15 through 17. Then, it'll be at the Formula One Australian Grand Prix later in the month.
""We do have more plans for it, but for the time being, these are confidential, but you can be sure we have some exciting ideas,"" Ford Performance spokesperson Jay Ward told Motor1 in a statement.

BYD Brings Denza Brand To Europe With Striking D9 Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/710022/denza-d9-minivan-europe-debut/,It's available as a plug-in hybrid and EV with a seven-seat layout.,12/25/2024 8:55,"The 2024 Geneva Motor Show kicks off today, and while most international brands are missing, there are a handful of European debuts. This D9 minivan marks the launch of Denza on the Old Continent. If the name doesn't ring a bell, it's a brand created by Chinese automaker BYD and Mercedes in 2010. Initially, the joint venture was 50:50, but the German luxury brand reduced its share to 10 percent in 2021 when Denza underwent restructuring.
BYD is paving the way for Denza in Europe by bringing the D9, a large people mover with a high-end interior to rival another posh minivan—the Lexus LM. It's not a completely new model since it initially went on sale in China in 2022. Much like in the People's Republic, the Euro variant can be had as a plug-in hybrid or as a full EV.
The three-row family hauler has a boxy shape, large electrically operated sliding doors, a generous greenhouse, and two equally polarizing grille designs. The imposing front end is just as striking as other new minivans, including the Volvo EM90 / Zeekr 009 and the Toyota Alphard / Vellfire twins. The boxy shape with a nearly flat roofline maximizes interior space and there's a large panoramic sunroof to make the cabin feel more airy.
Even though it's showcasing the D9 in Geneva, Denza remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications for now. However, look no further than the Chinese version to discover all the relevant numbers. It's 206.7 in (5,250 mm) long, 77.2 in (1,960 mm) wide, and 75.6 in (1,920 mm) tall, with a massive wheelbase of 122.4 in (3,110 mm).
Since Denza wants to lure you away from buying that luxury SUV, the D9 has an upscale interior with leather just about everywhere you look. The cabin has a 2+2+3 configuration with adjustable and folding seats, not to mention ventilation and massaging functions. Aside from the usual pair of screens in the front, there are extra displays mounted on the armrests of the second-row seats to control various functions.
In addition, there's a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens, along with a small fridge that can hold as many as six bottles. The captain's chairs in the middle slide fore and aft, offering copious amounts of legroom, while the grab handle on the B-pillars makes it easier to get in and out. Even rearmost seats get USB ports and a central armrest, along with LED ambient lighting, and speakers from the Dynaudio sound system.
While Denza keeps European specifications shrouded in mystery for now, the D9 sold in China can be had as a plug-in hybrid with a turbocharged 1.5-liter gasoline engine. The PHEV model is available with front- and all-wheel drive, along with a 20.39-kWh battery and a bigger 40.06-kWh pack.
The combustion engine is good for 137 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque (231 Newton-meters)) while the front-mounted motor is rated at 228 hp and 251 lb-ft (340 Nm). Go for the all-wheel-drive model and Denza throws in a rear-mounted motor that produces 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm). The FWD versions have a combined output of 296 hp and 421 lb-ft (571 Nm), good for a sprint to 62 mph in 9.5 seconds. Step up to AWD models and you're rewarded with a healthy 401 hp and 502 lb-ft (681 Nm) to cut the sprint time to 7.9 seconds.
In China, the Denza D9 electric model is also offered with a choice of FWD and AWD. Both have a front motor with 308 hp and 266 lb-ft (360 Nm). Upgrading to the all-wheel-drive model brings a rear motor producing 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm) for a combined 369 hp and 347 lb-ft (470 Nm). The FWD variant takes 9.5 seconds to complete the sprint, or just 6.9 seconds if you go with AWD. Both share a 103.4-kilowatt-hour LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery pack.
As far as range is concerned, we should point out that the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) differs greatly from the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) used in Europe. The Denza D9 electric model with front-wheel drive promises to cover 385 miles (620 kilometers) while its all-wheel-drive counterpart can do 373 miles (600 kilometers). Maximum charging power is 166 kilowatts, in which case 15 minutes enables a driving range of 143 miles (230 kilometers).
The D9 isn't Denza's only model at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show since BYD's sub-brand also has the purely electric N7. It's a five-seater SUV with a height-adjustable air suspension, panoramic sunroof, and a maximum driving range of 354 miles (570 kilometers). It'll take 20 minutes to juice up the battery from 30 to 80 percent thanks to 230-kW charging capabilities.
Denza is scheduled to reach the European market near the end of the year.

Jeep Is Preparing Five New Or Refreshed Models For 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/709929/what-jeep-is-planning-2025/,"The all-electric Wagoneer S goes on sale in Q3 2024, while the smaller Recon will launch by the end of the year.",12/25/2024 8:55,"2025 will be a big year for Jeep. It’ll have two battery-electric vehicles on sale and a larger lineup of plug-in hybrids. Jeep’s new CEO, Antonio Filosa, briefed the media Friday about the comapny’s plans for the upcoming year and its strategy to increase its market share.
The Jeep Wagoneer S will enter production in the second quarter of this year before going on sale in Q3 for a short 2024 model year run. It’ll be the fastest Jeep ever when it goes on sale, hitting 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S have 600 horsepower and ride on Stellantis’ scalable STLA Large platform, just like the new Recon, which should launch before the end of the year. Jeep wouldn’t provide specific dates for Recon’s production and arrival, but it will have its first full sales year in 2025 alongside the Wagoneer S.
Jeep’s lineup of 4xe plug-in hybrids will grow through next year. One model likely to arrive is the previously announced Gladiator PHEV, with Jeep planning to launch five new models or updated variants in 2025. The revamped lineup is part of the brand’s strategy to increase its market share in the US after five consecutive years of falling sales.
Ready For Off-Road Fun:
Jeep is already laying the groundwork for a successful 2025. It's lowered the prices of several models for 2024, including the Grand Cherokee and the recently updated Gladiator, and it’ll integrate the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer into the Jeep brand. The Wrangler also got an update for this model year. Filosa has also implemented a new team to improve quality and lower costs.

The Ineos Fusilier Is The Retro Electric Off-Roader Of Your Fantasies,https://www.motor1.com/news/709875/ineos-fusilier/,Ineos' second vehicle is a smaller EV with a range extender option and squared-off retro looks.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Ineos Automotive revealed on Friday its third vehicle, an all-electric SUV called the Fusilier. Like its first SUV, the Grenadier, the Fusilier sports a squared-off, retro-inspired design. In addition to a purely electric variant, Ineos will offer the Fusilier with a gas-powered range-extender option.
The Fusilier will deliver ""world-class off-road capability with zero compromise to on-road performance,"" according to Ineos. Shorter and lower than the Grenadier, the Fusilier will be built on a skateboard platform featuring a steel top hat, a steel underbody, and aluminum doors.
Ineos has yet to release details on the Fusilier's 4x4 powertrain, so we don't know things like battery size or range.
“As we developed this vehicle, we quickly concluded that in order to move towards decarbonization but continue making cars that consumers want to drive, we need a mix of powertrain technologies,"" CEO Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. ""BEVs are perfect for certain uses: shorter trips and urban deliveries, but industry and governments need to have realistic expectations around other technologies that can help accelerate the necessary pace of change.""
Going by photos released by Ineos, the Fusilier looks to have some real off-road chops, with all-terrain tires, a front skid plate, and high bumpers. The hood and door designs remind us of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class. According to Top Gear, the shorter, lower silhouette and things like active grille shutters were used to improve efficiency.
Ineos says it partnered with Magna to develop the Fusilier. The SUV will be built at Magna's facility in Graz, Austria. It joins cars like the G-Class, the BMW Z4, the Toyota Supra, and the Fisker Ocean as other cars contracted to be built by the company.
Expect more news from Ineos on the Fusilier's powertrain and launch details by Fall of this year.

2026 Kia EV8 / Stinger: Everything You Need To Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/709711/kia-ev8-stinger-electric-range-price-details/,"The Kia Stinger is gone, but the EV8 should be its electric successor.",12/25/2024 8:55,"Kia is on the fast track to electrification with no less than nine hybrid or full EVs already at dealerships. That number will increase with the upcoming EV8, a mid-size sedan that leaked out early to the public recently through official documents.
The details included everything from power outputs to estimated range, with styling expected to draw heavily from the EV4 Concept—a vehicle said to be inspired at least partly bt the Stinger. So there’s potential this electric sedan could be pretty darned exciting.
Kia hasn’t announced anything official yet, but the leaks and rumors paint a pretty clear picture of what’s to come. Here’s everything we know so far about the Kia EV8.
Kia is sticking with a specific design language for its electric models and we believe the EV8 will follow suit. Our exclusive renderings feature a longish nose despite the lack of a combustion engine, with tall doors and a raked windshield melding into a fastback shape. Some might call it a sedan, others will say it’s a five-door hatchback.
Regardless, this rendering pays homage to the Stinger with its overall shape. That includes a rather aggressive lower fascia in front and a bulky backside bringing up the rear, something we’ve already seen on the EV4 Concept. That also means it rides lower than the EV6, which Kia actually showcased with the Stinger to give the performance car its send-off. While the EV6 is more of a crosover, the EV8 will look more like a traditional sedan.
Lastly, the leaked info says this car has a codename of GT1, which we see as an ode to the 2011 GT concept that was basically a Stinger preview. It all points to the EV8 being a proper Stinger successor.
Here's where the EV8 should eclipse the Stinger… by a lot. Leaked details reveal a dual-motor powertrain generating 603 horsepower in top trim. That’s nearly double the power of the Stinger’s twin-turbo V6, but lower-spec trim levels are expected. A more modest 435-horsepower dual-motor model should be offered, as well as a single-motor variant generating 218 horsepower for just the rear wheels.
Of course, the Stinger’s overall performance wasn’t all about power. It was a balanced sports sedan with delicious handling characteristics, and the EV8 may follow suit. It will ride on Hyundai’s new Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) versus the E-GMP platform currently used by Hyundai and Kia EVs. Hyundai bills this as being far more advanced and flexible for multiple genres. Whether that includes a rip-snorting sports sedan, we’ll soon find out.
Making the most of that new platform will be a big ol’ battery, topping out at 113.2 kilowatt-hours according to the leaked documents. It’s unclear at this time if smaller battery options will be available, but it certainly wouldn’t be a surprise. The EV9 currently packs a 99.8-kilowatt-hour pack, and the EV6 offers either 58.0- or 77.4-kilowatt-hour options. At 113.2, this would be the biggest battery ever offered in a Kia.
With a big battery comes big range (in theory), and we’re hearing that could be nearly 500 miles on the generous WLTP cycle in Europe. An EPA-focused range could be closer to around 370 miles, but that’s still a strong number.
Right now, we’re hearing a production launch happening late in 2025 for the 2026 model year. Based on what we’ve seen from Kia in the past, that means an official debut could happen in the fourth quarter of 2024. There’s also a question of where it will be sold—Kia may offer it for the North American market, but oftentimes models go on sale first in South Korea with other markets following months later. That means it may not make it to US dealerships until later in 2026.
We have no information at this time regarding price, but we can offer some context for a general estimate. The outgoing Stinger had a price ranging from around $36,000 to over $50,000 in range-topping trim. The current EV6 starts at $42,600 but lands at $61,600 for a range-topping GT AWD model. As such, a starting price of around $45,000 is certainly possible, with the 603-hp version brushing against $65,000. Of course, we’ve seen EV prices fluctuate significantly in the last year, so there’s certainly time for markets to shift before EV8 production begins.
It’s unlikely that the EV8 will be eligible for an EV tax credit. Kia presently only has one manufacturing facility in the US and it doesn’t include EVs. However, some Kia leasing programs offer credits that match tax incentives. As with price, much can (and probably will) change between now and when the EV8 goes on sale.

"Jeep Recalls Nearly 200,000 Hybrids For Malfunctioning Defrost System",https://www.motor1.com/news/709402/jeep-wrangler-grand-cherokee-4xe-recall/,Certain Wrangler 4xes and Grand Cherokee 4xes have been recalled for a software issue that could disable the windshield defrost system.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Jeep is recalling nearly 200,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A recall issued by the automaker and published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe could have software that disables the windshield defrost system in certain conditions.
A select number of 2021-2024 Wranglers and 2022-2024 Grand Cherokees were built with incorrectly programmed hybrid control processor software. The recall affects 139,318 Wrangler 4xes and 59,825 Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, dating back to the beginning of the variants' production.
Jeep produced the affected vehicles from September 2, 2020, to August 24, 2023, and from July 23, 2021, to December 5, 2023, respectively. Jeep will fix the issue by updating the hybrid control processor. It's already implemented the new software in the models' production, so if you're about to take delivery of a new Jeep, you don't have to worry about this problem.
This is the Wrangler 4xe's second recall in four months. In November, Jeep asked owners not to charge their vehicle's battery due to a potential fire risk affecting 32,000 cars.
Stellantis says it first became aware of the issue in June 2023, investigating the inoperative defrost systems through January. It'll inform affected owners by April 5. If you think your Jeep may be affected, we suggest heading over to the NHTSA's recall website and punching in your VIN.

Chevy Silverado And GMC Sierra Plug-In Hybrids Coming: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/709472/chevy-silverado-gmc-sierra-phev/,GM has allegedly canceled a Ford Maverick-sized electric pickup truck.,12/25/2024 8:55,"""We're not going to dilute our investment with hybrids""—is what General Motors President Mark Reuss told Business Insider in 2022. But apparently the company has had a change of heart. During an investor briefing last month, CEO Mary Barra announced new plug-in hybrid models, with reports indicating the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra PHEVs are on the way.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, Autoweek claims GM is in a hurry to launch PHEV versions of the two trucks. The company has apparently initiated a ""crash program"" to speed up the development and market launch of the two electrified derivatives. We've reached out to both Chevy and GMC for comment, and we'll update the story if we hear back.
The plug-in hybrids would bridge the gap between the regular Silverado and Sierra with combustion engines and the newly launched purely electric models. The PHEV duo would address the range anxiety that typically comes with pure EVs, especially workhorses used to tow and/or carry heavy cargo.
Some will remember what Barra said back at a Barclays investor conference in 2019: ""Customers generally aren't interested in hybrids, the value proposition there. We believe moving to electric vehicles as quickly as possible is the right thing to do."" Earlier the same year, Reuss told The Wall Street Journal it would be wiser to spend the R&D money on EVs rather than PHEVs: ""If I had a dollar more to invest, would I spend it on a hybrid? Or would I spend it on the answer that we all know is going to happen, and get there faster and better than anybody else?""
In 2024, the scenario has changed. Demand for EVs is cooling down, and PHEVs could serve as a stopgap before full electrification. The Wall Street Journal reports ""influential dealers"" are putting pressure on GM to launch hybrid models to avoid losing customers who aren't ready to switch to EVs. In late January, Barra said during a call about GM's financial results for Q4 2023 the ""forward plan includes bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America.
According to the same report from Autoweek, GM has also changed its mind about replacing the ancient Express and Savana with electric vans for the 2026 model year. The plan was to use GM's Ultium platform, with the new models to take after the BrightDrop Zevo 600 commercial fleet delivery van, but those plans have been shelved.
There were also plans for two electric trucks, one about the size of a Ford Maverick and the other roughly as big as a Ranger. However, the former has purportedly been canceled while development of the latter has been halted.
Should a Silverado and Sierra hybrid hit the market, these wouldn't be the first. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, GM paired a 6.0-liter V8 engine with two electric motors for a ""two-mode hybrid system."" It was compatible with both 2WD and 4WD versions and came with a 300-volt nickel-metal hydride battery pack mounted underneath the second-row seats. The combustion engine was good for 332 horsepower and 367 pound-feet of torque while the e-motors were each rated at 80 hp.
The old hybrid models were able to run solely on electric juice at speeds of up to 30 mph (48 km/h) and there was even regenerative braking to charge the battery. Their successors, if GM is indeed planning them, are slated to be PHEVs, meaning there's going to be a charging port to replenish the battery like you would do on a Silverado EV or Sierra EV.

"The New Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid Is Less Powerful, More Expensive",https://www.motor1.com/news/709282/porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid/,"536 hp for $126,800.",12/25/2024 8:55,"When Porsche introduced the third-generation Panamera last November, it only showed the base model with rear- and all-wheel drive alongside the hot Turbo E-Hybrid. Zuffenhausen is now diversifying the lineup by launching two additional electrified models. They're not traditional ""Turbo"" models, but they swap the big V8 in favor of a V6 and keep the pair of turbochargers.
The Panamera 4E Hybrid combines a 2.9-liter engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 463 horsepower and 479 pound-feet. Compared to its predecessor, the new model has gained eight mighty horses but has lost 37 lb-ft. Despite its heft, this is a seriously quick sedan (it's technically a hatchback) since it takes just 3.9 seconds to reach 60 mph, or 0.3s less than the model it's replacing. Flat out, it'll do an identical 174 mph.
The Panamera 4S E-Hybrid now has 536 hp and 553 lb-ft, which means Porsche has sacrificed 16 horses while carrying over the same amount of torque. It completes the sprint in 3.5 seconds as before, en route to 180 mph, down by 5 mph.
All electrified Panamera models share an upgraded battery pack with a capacity boosted by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours without increasing the physical size. The battery provides juice to a beefier e-motor mounted within the automatic transmission, rated at 187 hp and 331 lb-ft.
Porsche isn't disclosing range details for the US-spec models for now. However, we know the European ones can travel on electric power for up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) in the case of the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and 92 kilometers (57 miles) for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. These WLTP figures are likely to decrease for the EPA-certified range.
In the US, Porsche wants $115,500 for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and $126,800 for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. The new models command a premium of $6,500 and $7,600, respectively. For your money's worth, an adaptive air suspension and matrix LED headlights are standard. To sweeten the pot, 14-way comfort seats, a heated steering wheel, soft-close doors, and lane change assist are included as well.
The order books will open in late March, and you'll pay an extra $1,995 for delivery and handling fees. The cars will hit dealers this fall.

The Cupra Born VZ Is An Electric Hot Hatch With 322 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/709322/cupra-born-vz-debut-specs/,The Volkswagen Group is trying to spice up its EV offerings.,12/25/2024 8:55,"Spun off from the Volkswagen Group's SEAT brand in 2018, Cupra is introducing its first electric performance vehicle. The sporty derivative is based on the Born compact model and gets the ""VZ"" suffix, which is an acronym for ""veloz""—Spanish for ""fast."" The brand's first-ever EV gets a healthy power boost and other upgrades.
The rear-wheel-drive electric hot hatch uses an upgraded motor delivering 322 horsepower and a massive instant torque of 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters). These output figures represent a huge boost of 94 hp and 235 Nm (173 lb-ft) over the previous most potent variant of the Cupra Born. Courtesy of the newly unlocked electric oomph, the VZ variant shaves off a full second from the sprint to 62 mph (100 km/h), which now takes 5.7 seconds. Top speed has gone up by 25 mph (40 km/h) to 124 mph (200 km/h).
There's more to the Born VZ than a beefier e-motor since Cupra is also giving it a pair of exclusive 20-inch wheels, including a forged set with performance tires. The cooler alternative to the troubled SEAT brand has bumped the battery pack's net capacity by 2 kWh to 79 kWh for an estimated range of 335 miles (570 kilometers). The steering is sharper and there are additional tweaks to the suspension for better handling while the brakes feel more direct than before.
In terms of styling, Cupra is offering the new Born VZ in this Dark Forest color or you can play it safe by getting the feisty electric hatch in Midnight Black. The newly added “VZ” logo on the tailgate has a dark chrome look to echo the “Cupra” lettering. Inside, it gets a pair of body-hugging seats not shared with the lesser models. However, these bucket seats are already available in some performance cars with a combustion engine, including the Formentor VZ5 with its inline-five engine borrowed from Audi.
For the range-topping Born, Cupra has upped the infotainment's screen size by 0.9 inches to 12.9 inches. More important is the touch slider to adjust the climate and volume since it's finally illuminated. At an additional cost, buyers can get an optional 10-speaker, 425-watt Sennheiser sound system. As standard, the VZ variant gets paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel to choose from one of three levels of energy recuperation.
The Born VZ will go on sale in Europe in the third quarter of the year. Also in 2024, we should see its equivalent Volkswagen version, the ID.3 GTX, or whatever name the sporty electric hatchback will use. These two will compete in a rarified segment that includes the MG4 XPower. The smaller Alpine A290 will join them soon.

"Sony And Honda Have Three New EVs On The Way, Including An SUV",https://www.motor1.com/news/708807/afeela-sony-honda-suv-and-compact-coming-2025-2027-2028/,"Plus, a sedan and a more affordable compact are also on the way.",12/25/2024 8:55,"Sony Honda Mobility is the automotive joint venture between Honda and Sony. It aims to build electric vehicles with advanced self-driving technology. Now, there are new details about when the company's first models will hit the road.
In addition to the previously announced Afeela electric sedan coming in 2025, Sony Honda Mobility will launch an SUV in 2027 and a less expensive compact model in 2028 or later, according to Nikkei Asia. All three vehicles will ride on the same platform.
Sony Honda Mobility's compact model will allegedly share components with Honda's in-house developed EVs to keep prices down. The company just showed off the Saloon concept at CES ahead of launching a production model in 2026.
We don't have many details about Sony Honda Mobility's SUV yet. Sony previously showed the Vision-S 02 concept (below) that previewed how such a vehicle might look. It shared a design language with the sedan but with a taller ride and a hatchback.
The Afeela sedan launching in 2025 uses front and rear electric motors, each making 241 horsepower. It has a 91.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Sales in the United States should start in early 2026.
Sony Honda Mobility is loading the Afeela with technology. The pre-production model has 45 sensors, including lidar and eight cameras. Chips from Qualcomm would allegedly provide the processing capability to support Level 3 self-driving, meaning a person would still need to take over control at times.
The Afeela has an understated, smoothly styled exterior. Inside, there's a screen spanning nearly the entire dashboard. Sony intends to provide access to its massive media empire so folks can watch movies like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse or play Fortnite on this display. The driver grips a yoke steering wheel.
Honda would build some of these EVs in Ohio, according to Quartz. Given the location, the vehicles might use the batteries coming from Honda and LG's joint venture factory in the state.

2026 Nissan Leaf: Everything You Need To Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/708804/new-nissan-leaf-range-price-details/,The new Leaf will look dramatically different than the current hatchback.,12/25/2024 8:55,"When it debuted in 2011, the Nissan Leaf was revolutionary. It was one of the first affordable EVs that appealed to consumers on a mass scale. By the end of 2023, the company delivered over 670,000 of them worldwide, including more than 184,000 in the US.
The second-gen model launched in 2018 with more power and better range and utility. However, with EVs evolving at lightning speed, the Leaf wasn’t as competitive as it had been in the past. Sales fell 41 percent in 2023 to just 7,152 total units, with Hyundai, Tesla, and other brands began offering more affordable and more efficient alternatives.
But there’s a new Leaf on the horizon. Nissan’s third-generation compact EV will debut sometime in mid-2025 to take on this more competitive market. There’s still plenty we don’t know about the new Leaf ahead of 2025 – but here’s what we can tell you until then.
The new Leaf will reportedly take styling cues from the 2021 Chill-Out concept (pictured throughout), which was a sleek-looking crossover with a broad, stacked grille and wing-shaped lights on its outer edges. The roofline had a simple arch, and there was subtle sculpting along the flanks. The rear even had a clear panel with taillights embedded in it, but that probably won’t make it to production. Otherwise, most of these design cues should carry over.
Unfortunately, there are no official powertrain details on the third-gen Leaf yet. It allegedly rides on the CMF-EV platform, which also sits underneath the Ariya electric crossover. That model is available with a single motor producing 214 or 238 horsepower, or two motors offering 335 and 389 horsepower. There are 66.0-kilowatt-hour and 91.0-kilowatt-hour batteries available.
The timing, though, suggests the Leaf would not yet adopt Nissan’s solid-state batteries, at least at launch. The first vehicle to use those cutting-edge packs don't arrive until 2028. But we do know that most Nissans will move to the NACS charging standard, and that could include the Leaf.
The Nissan Leaf will almost certainly have more range than the current model, which offers just 215 miles at its most efficient. The new batteries will supposedly be up to 30 percent denser than the current ones, which should mean at least 230 miles of range minimum.
We should see the new Nissan Leaf as early as next year. The available information suggests the EV will debut mid-2025 with production slated to kick off in the UK in 2026. It’s likely to be a 2026 model when it goes on sale in the US.
No pricing details about the third-gen Leaf are out there yet. The current model range includes the base S grade for $29,280 or the SV Plus for $37,330. Inflation means that the new one would probably cost a bit more. However, Nissan needs to keep prices in check to remain competitive against affordable EVs like the Hyundai Kona Electric, which starts at $34,010,
Nissan currently builds the Leaf in Smyrna, Tennessee; Sunderland, England; and Yokosuka, Japan – which means it is eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. However, the company plans to end assembly in the United States in mid-2025, which means the third-gen model would not be eligible for the up-to-$7,500 tax credit in the US.

Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,12/25/2024 9:01,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,12/25/2024 9:01,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

"VinFast VF9 Price Dropped By $12,000 As U.S. Deliveries Begin",https://insideevs.com/news/741613/vinfast-vf9-us-deliveries/,The three-row electric SUV is competing with the likes of the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq. It's also cheaper than before.,11/20/2024 3:28,"Vietnamese automaker VinFast has officially started deliveries of its more upmarket electric SUV, the VF9. The battery-powered three-row SUV slots above the VF8 and competes with other family-oriented EVs such as the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq.
Two versions of the VinFast VF9 will be available in the United States, the VF9 Eco and VF9 Plus. The entry-level Eco starts at $69,800 (excluding destination) while the slightly more upmarket Plus starts from $73,800. That said, the first units to be delivered to U.S. customers will be VF9 Plus models.
The prices are much lower than originally announced. Last year, the entry-level version had an MSRP of $83,000, while the Plus was priced at $91,000. These estimates were lowered in December to $79,800 for the Eco and $85,800 for the Plus trim.
More VinFast Stuff
To sweeten the deal, VinFast is offering a promotional lease price of $529 per month for the first 100 VF9s delivered stateside. According to the automaker, this figure includes a $3,500 discount and a $2,000 down payment. Meanwhile, the VF9 Eco will become available later this year.
Both trim levels come with the same battery–a 123-kilowatt-hour (usable) pack delivering up to 330 miles of range on the Eco and 291 miles on the Plus. The main reason for the range difference is the wheel size. The Eco is equipped with 20-inch wheels, while the Plus comes with standard 21-inchers. The more upmarket version also gets front fog lights, a 12-way power driver seat with memory, heating, ventilation and massage, as well as eight-way power adjustment for second-row seats. The Plus can be optionally specced with six seats instead of seven.
The VF9 Eco and VF9 Plus come with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup delivering 402 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque. The EV supports Plug & Charge and Auto Charge at compatible chargers. Plugging it into a DC fast charger will replenish the battery from 10% to 70% state of charge in 35 minutes, according to VinFast.
The VF9 enters the increasingly competitive large electric three-row SUV segment. Measuring 201.5 inches long, 78.9 inches wide and 66.7 inches tall, it’s right up there with cars like the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq. Compared to the EV9, the VF9’s wheelbase is two inches longer while the body is 4.3 inches longer. Compared to the Cadillac Vistiq, the VinFast VF9 is 4 inches shorter but the wheelbase is 2 inches longer.
VinFast didn’t say anything about the VF9’s eligibility for the federal tax credit. The electric three-row SUV is made in Vietnam, but we expect it to be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit when leasing thanks to a loophole in the legislation. It's also worth mentioning that the company's first model sold in the U.S., the VF8, received underwhelming reviews from the press. Journalists complained about the poor ride quality and lackluster software that seemed unfinished at launch. Some of these issues were reportedly fixed along the way.
Pricing-wise, the Kia EV9 is the most affordable of the three, with a starting price of $56,395 (including destination) for the entry-level version with rear-wheel drive and 230 miles of range. Meanwhile, the Cadillac Vistiq is priced from $78,790 (including destination) and comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive and a GM-estimated range of 300 miles.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis' New 'Engineering Marvel' Trucks Aim For 690 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/741584/stellantis-truck-platform-stla-frame-erev-bev/,"The new STLA Frame truck platform supports gas, hydrogen, hybrid, electric and EREV power.",11/19/2024 17:30,"Stellantis is under increasing pressure to deliver. The European conglomerate, with as many as 14 brands under its umbrella, including Jeep, Dodge and Ram, has struggled to keep pace with the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. Just over the past year, it has laid off hundreds of employees, its workers have gone on strikes and its dealers have been furious about its business strategies. Now it hopes to turn things around with a new platform called STLA Frame.
The platform is engineered for full-size ladder-frame pickup trucks and SUVs. It can be equipped with powertrains for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range hybrids (EREVs) and in the future, even internal combustion, parallel hybrid and hydrogen propulsion systems. Stellantis claimed the EREV can deliver up to 690 miles of range, whereas the BEV can deliver up to 500 miles. It's unclear if those are estimates for European WLTC or American EPA test cycles.
EREVs have been gaining traction lately. Multiple automakers, including Hyundai and Scout Motors, plan to launch EREVs in the next few years. EREVs have both an electric powertrain with a large battery and motors plus a traditional internal combustion engine. The role of the gas engine, however, is only to recharge the battery as the wheels run on electric power only. Here's a detailed explanation of how EREV systems work.
STLA Frame is also engineered to do some heavy-duty tasks. Stellantis claims it will have a maximum towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and a payload rating of 2,700 hundred pounds. The platform appears highly scalable and can accommodate battery sizes between 159 kilowatt-hours and 200+ kWh. Here's the range of dimensions it supports:
STLA Frame BEVs will get an 800-volt architecture. So with 350-kilowatt DC fast chargers, owners can add 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes. EREV will get a 400-volt architecture with a maximum DC fast charging rate of 175 kilowatts—enough to add about 50 miles of range in 10 minutes. Both will be capable of bi-directional charging, so sending power back to the grid, powering a home or an external appliance, or charging another EV will be possible.
The 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which is expected to go on sale in the U.S. in early 2025, uses this platform.
It's unclear which Jeep EVs will ride on STLA Frame. However, the American off-road brand has several models in the pipeline, including the next-generation Wagoneer, which might use one of these configurations. Jeep is also expected to begin deliveries of the Wagoneer S this fall. That SUV rides on the STLA Large platform. We also expect a Wrangler-inspired Recon EV and an affordable electric Renegade within the next few years.
Looking at how hybrid sales have rocketed in the recent past, along with concerns of BEV performance in heavy-duty use cases like towing and hauling, Stellantis may be right in adopting this flexible approach.  Plus, the incoming Trump administration will almost certainly repeal the consumer incentives for BEVs—so having multiple powertrains at hand may be the smart thing to do for now.
""We’re proud of this engineering marvel and look forward to seeing it come to life in our upcoming product blitz on Jeep and Ram,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said.

Here's The $634 Million Electric Jaguar That Died At The Last Minute,https://insideevs.com/news/741582/jaguar-xj-ev-canceled-leak/,"""We would have done the facelift by now,"" design legend Ian Callum lamented on social media.",11/19/2024 17:00,"Jaguar is back.
No one can say that today's relaunch of the storied British brand—complete with a bold new logo, a high-fashion vibe, and a super-luxury mission but no actual cars—was a universal success. But it's the first sign of life from Jaguar in a very long time, and it's further confirmation that Jaguar sees its future as all-electric.
Yet this isn't the first time we've heard bold promises from Jaguar, which has been struggling since its failed bid to go toe-to-toe with BMW in the 2010s and hasn't launched an actual new model in almost 10 years. The 89-year-old brand was supposed to launch a similar electric onslaught at the start of our current decade, but its then-new CEO Thierry Bolloré pulled the plug at the last minute.
That car, an electric rebirth of the iconic XJ sedan, has been shrouded in mystery for years—until now. Ahead of Jaguar's big announcement today, photos appeared online of an electric XJ prototype that resembles a cross between a 2010s Jaguar sedan and a Tesla Model S. Normally, that sort of thing might get written off as rumor or innuendo, but one post caught the attention of someone who would know what he's talking about: legendary Jaguar designer Ian Callum.
That's as good a confirmation as any, I'd say.
So with Jaguar finally doing something novel, it's worth asking: what the heck happened to this car? Well, after the success of the Jaguar I-Pace—which people often forget was a groundbreaking EV in its day and an early Tesla Model 3 competitor—the company invested billions of dollars into more electric models, starting with an XJ EV. Then Bolloré, a Frenchman and veteran of Michelin and Renault, was named CEO in 2020 and one of his first edicts was to scrap the entire project even though it was extremely close to completion and release. That was a reported write-down of at least £500 million, or $634 million at current exchange rates. His plan was to take Jaguar more upmarket than it's ever been in modern times, winning on profit margins instead of volume sales.
And he evidently didn't think highly of what the electric XJ meant for that mission or for future technologies. ""It was one of the toughest decisions I have ever made, especially since it was in my first month, but XJ was a completely different kind of car from the ones we were proposing – different in technology, battery chemistry, electronics, size, performance and market position,"" Bolloré told Autocar back in 2021. It would never have suited our plans.”
The XJ electric prototype rendered in complete form using AI.
But Bolloré himself would only last another year in the CEO slot until he was replaced with 30-year Jaguar veteran Adrian Mardell. And ""plans"" are certainly something that have felt in short supply at Jaguar in the interim. As we've reported previously, it has launched no new models in years, killed off the I-Pace after age allowed it to become uncompetitive, opted to hit pause on the whole ""selling cars"" thing while executives have bemoaned how ""frustrating"" the move to an electric lineup has been.
Jaguar does seem to be on track to show the world its electric grand touring sedan now, but this move from premium brand to a super-luxury brand means this EV could cost at least $150,000. Will it be worth it, especially as the EV-and-software era means that premium cars aren't what they used to be?
The disguised prototype of the new electric Jaguar (2024)
One thing does feel certain now: this is probably it for Jaguar if it can't pull this off. The brand has been a non-entity in the U.S. so long that it's almost a distant memory for everyone but aging classic car enthusiasts, and there's no guarantee it has what it takes to keep up with quickly evolving players in the EV space—including ones like Lucid Motors or whatever high-tech Chinese brands it has to deal with abroad.
Either way, now we know what the electric Jaguar XJ could've been. And in retrospect, canceling it feels like a mistake; it could've been something, anything at all, for a brand that now has to start from zero again.

Jaguar Has A New Logo,https://insideevs.com/news/741505/jaguar-new-logo/,"It’s a little more complicated than that, though. Here’s why.",11/19/2024 8:25,"Jaguar, the British luxury automaker that used to manufacture the I-Pace electric crossover, is starting fresh from a clean slate. It already announced that it’s taking a sort of sabbatical year off from selling any cars before introducing three brand-new all-electric models.
But that’s not all. Now, Jaguar has revealed its new brand identity, including a new logo and everything else surrounding it. But let me say right from the start that it’s not as simple as it might sound. That’s because the British marque isn’t going down the usual route with a simple graphic logo and instead uses several graphical elements as part of its “Copy Nothing” ethos that traces its roots back to the brand’s founder, Sir William Lyons.
In total, four new design elements have been produced, all of which are based on a creative philosophy known as Exuberant Modernism. The problem is that Jaguar isn’t calling any of these elements a logo, so we’ll have to see what its upcoming EVs will end up with on the hood.
More Jaguar Stuff
First, there’s a “Device Mark,” which is a fancy way of saying “We made a new font” named Exuberant. It’s basically just the word “Jaguar.” Next is a 16-bar grid made of horizontal stripes called a “Strike Through.” This will be used as both a background and a “universally recognized symbol” of the new EVs, as per Autocar. See, I told you it’s complicated. But that’s not all.
The third new design element of Jaguar’s reinvention is the “Maker’s Mark,” which is made up of two elements–a redesigned Jaguar “Leaper” and a medallion-shaped “Monogram” that combines the letters “j” and “r” in a circle. The latter “is a code for expression and a signifier of a completed work,” according to the British automaker. It will be used “as a flourish or finished touch.” Jaguar’s new brand identity also includes the “exuberant” use of color as a cornerstone of its new look.
Jaguar Device Mark
Jaguar Maker's Mark
Jaguar Monogram
It all sounds very fancy, but I guess that’s to be expected from a car manufacturer that wants to sell its upcoming super-GT EV for six figures. That’s just the start of the automaker’s new path as an EV-only builder, with two more models to follow, all of which will debut throughout 2026 as British rivals to models like the Mercedes-Benz EQS, Porsche Taycan and more.
Until that happens though, Jaguar will showcase its design direction on December 2. It will signal a “complete reset,” according to CEO Adrian Mardell, who said, “This time, we’re going to do something spectacular.”",Iulian Dnistran

But a bunch of numbers on a sheet of paper don’t mean much if the claims don’t hold water in the real world. That’s why Mercedes-Benz put two CLA EV prototypes to the test on the famed Nardo high-speed track in southern Italy.
More CLA Stuff
The result? A new endurance world record.
One of the prototypes covered 2,309 miles in 24 hours, topping the previous record set in 2019 when a Porsche Taycan drove 2,128 miles in 24 hours. This includes charging stops, of course. Thanks to its 800-volt traction battery and 320-kilowatt maximum charging rate, the CLA EV prototype needed to stop 40 times to recharge its battery.
Each stop took around 10 minutes, which is enough to get the car’s state of charge from 10% to 50%. That’s the equivalent of 186 miles or about 36 kilowatt-hours (the battery pack can hold 85 kWh). Adding everything together, the car was stopped for a total of six hours and 40 minutes to recharge. The average speed was 96.2 miles per hour–including charging stops–and the car’s 130 mph top speed was reached during the session.
The distance covered by the record-breaking prototype is nearly the same as the distance between Los Angeles and Cleveland.
The record-setting CLA prototype, which Mercedes-Benz claims is a close-to-production unit, started the 24-hour run with a full battery. During the endurance test, the engineering team closely monitored the ambient temperature and wind conditions to alter the charging strategy in real-time. The air temperature ranged from 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit at night to 84.2 degrees during the day.
Six drivers were part of the effort–three for each of the prototypes–with three shift changes. That’s eight hours of driving for each of the drivers. The record-setting CLA EV was a rear-wheel drive version with a single, 268-horsepower motor that works in conjunction with a two-speed transmission. The road-going Mercedes-Benz CLA EV is due in late 2025 as a 2026 model.",Iulian Dnistran
The Nissan N7 Is A Big Electric Sedan You Can’t Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/741084/2025-nissan-n7-electric-sedan/,Unless you're willing to move to China.,12/25/2024 9:02,"In a sea of electric crossovers and SUVs, a good ol' sedan is a nice change of pace. However, there’s still a problem. Nissan’s new EV will be made in China exclusively for the local market. The N7 was developed with local partner Dongfeng through their 50:50 joint venture. If it weren’t for the badge, I’d honestly be hard-pressed to identify this car as a Nissan.
If the N7 already looks familiar, Dongfeng Nissan previewed the production model in April with the Epoch concept. It’s a sleek sedan that ticks all the design trend boxes in 2024: split headlights, a rear light bar, an illuminated logo, two-tone wheels, and a swoopy roofline. The LED daytime running lights send a bit of a Hyundai vibe, but the boomerang-shaped lights below give the car a unique front fascia.
Some would be tempted to say this is Nissan’s first-ever electric sedan. However, that’s not the case. The Leaf-based Sylphy Zero Emission was launched in 2018 as the company’s first EV made for the Chinese market. Just how big is the N7? At 194 inches (4930 millimeters) long and 74.6 inches (1895 millimeters) wide, it’s roughly the same size as a Volkswagen ID.7. However, it sits closer to the road, at 58.5 inches (1487 millimeters) tall. It measures 114.7 inches (2915 millimeters) between the axles, so the wheelbase is a tad shorter than the VW’s.
Nissan isn’t willing to show the interior just yet, nor is it ready to divulge technical specifications beyond the car’s measurements. We do know it sits on a locally developed modular electric architecture and will be offered with a “Navigate on Autopilot” advanced driver-assist system. Inside, the touchscreen should run smoothly courtesy of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295P processor.
The N7 will go on sale in China during the first half of 2025. It’s one of several models included in Nissan’s “The Arc” midterm plan, which will allow the Dongfeng Nissan joint venture to accelerate the launch of hybrid and electric vehicles in China. This strategy calls for a total of 30 models globally by 2027, including seven vehicles for the United States.

The Porsche Taycan Gets Three New Models For 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/740686/porsche-taycan-updates-2025/,"Want a Porsche Taycan? On some level, of course you do. And now you have more options, ranging from 402 hp to 1,019 hp.",11/12/2024 10:00,"When it comes to modern electric vehicles, the Porsche Taycan is objectively tough to beat in almost every metric. It's fast, it looks fantastic and it's a top leader in range and charging times without sacrificing performance. And after some big upgrades this year, the Taycan lineup is growing to offer buyers even more ways to get one in 2025.
Porsche announced today that three new members of the updated Taycan family will on sale in the first quarter of 2025. The base sedan gets all-wheel-drive to become the Taycan 4 for the first time ever (previously, that was only available in Cross Turismo form) and the GTS trim returns in both sedan and Sport Turismo wagon forms. This means that there are now 13 flavors of Taycan to choose from, ranging in power from 402 hp to 1,019 hp.
""The new models have more power, longer range, accelerate faster and can be charged in less time and with greater stability,"" Porsche officials said in a news release. The simultaneous improvement of performance and efficiency is down to a number of factors: an advanced powertrain with a new rear-axle motor with up to 107 hp more power than its predecessor on all models, a modified pulse inverter with optimized software, more powerful batteries, revised thermal management, a next-generation heat pump, increased recuperation and optional all-wheel-drive strategy."" More importantly, at 800-volt DC charging stations, the Taycan models can charge at an extremely impressive 320 kW, making it one of the quickest-charging EVs around.
We'll start with the GTS models. This ""sporty all-rounder"" was the midpack Taycan model on the first generation of vehicles, offering tons of performance options without going completely nuts (in a good way, of course) like the Turbo and Turbo S variants above it. The updated Taycan debuted without the GTS models, but now they're here in sedan and wagon form.
The GTS gets up to 690 hp of ""overboost power"" when Launch Control is used, a full 100 hp more than its predecessor. And with the Sport Chrono package, the driver can add an additional 93 hp for 10 seconds on top of that. Both the sedan and Sport Turismo wagon will do zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds. The GTS even gets a ""sound profile"" that is unique to this model. Other GTS upgrades include the multifunction sport steering wheel, optional rear-axle steering, adaptive air suspension with torque vectoring, standard adaptive sport seats and retuned Porsche Active Ride. The GTS models starts at $147,900 for the sedan and $149,800 for the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, not including any dealer charges or the $1,995 destination fee.
But adding AWD to the base sedan is arguably the most exciting development here. It can be had with the standard Performance battery or the optional Performance Battery Plus battery, which put down 402 hp or 429 hp on overboost, respectively. The traction advantage of AWD lets the Taycan 4 hit 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, 0.1 seconds faster than the RWD car, without skimping on efficiency.
""Additionally, the front electric motor is electrically decoupled whenever traction, driving dynamics, and driving stability allow it. It then switches back on within milliseconds when needed, for example when accelerating or recuperating."" That one starts at $103,300, also excluding the destination fees.
With these additions, the updated Taycan family gets some selections in line with the first-generation EV, and then some. What's missing from today's release, however, is these models' electric range; we expect to hear more about that in the coming months.
Despite the Taycan's incredible performance and excellence as an EV, Porsche has had some challenges selling it lately—especially globally, and especially in China, where the electric competition is in incredibly fierce. Can these new models help get the job done?

2026 Cadillac Vistiq: Three Rows Of Seats And 300 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/740692/2026-cadillac-vistiq-specs-range/,"With a starting price of $78,790, the all-new Vistiq slots between the rather popular Lyriq and much larger Escalade IQ electric SUVs.",11/12/2024 9:09,"General Motors said it’s working on more electric cars, and it’s keeping true to its word. After the budget-minded Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV, GM is giving people who crave a little more luxury another option.
This is the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq. It made its official debut today with more finalized specs, and now we know it's scheduled to go into production in early 2025 at GM’s Spring Hill Manufacturing plant in Tennessee before heading to dealerships in the summer.
With a starting price of $78,790 including destination, the all-new Vistiq slots between the rather popular Lyriq and much larger Escalade IQ electric SUVs. It has three rows of seating as standard and the only powertrain option is a dual-motor setup good for 615 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. The zero to sixty miles per hour time is 3.7 seconds with Velocity Max enabled.
More Cadillac Stories
The two electric motors are powered by a 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a GM-estimated driving range of 300 miles. Charging is done via a CCS1 port located at the front-left of the vehicle, with Cadillac saying up to 79 miles of range can be added in 10 minutes when connected to a DC fast charger. The company didn’t say what the peak DC charging rate is, though.
On AC power, the Vistiq can gain up to 20.5 miles of range in an hour when hooked up to a 7.7-kilowatt charger and up to 28.5 miles when connected to an 11.5-kW home charger. With the optional 19.2-kW onboard charger, up to 46.7 miles of range can be added in an hour from a powerful enough Level 2 charger. Vehicle-to-home functionality is baked-in, but you’ll need GM Energy’s V2H Bundle to send power from the car’s battery to your home.
Size-wise, the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq is 205.5 inches long, 86.7 inches wide (without mirrors) and 71 inches tall, while the wheelbase is 121.8 inches. By comparison, the Kia EV9, another three-row electric SUV, is about 8 inches shorter, 9 inches narrower and 2 inches shorter. however, the wheelbase of the EV9 is a fifth of an inch longer than the Vistiq. The Kia EV9 is also available with rear-wheel drive only and has a lower starting price of $56,395, while the maximum range is 304 miles.
Another three-row electric SUV, the Rivian R1S, starts at $77,900. At this price, it comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive, 533 hp and an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles. Paying more will get you more power and more range–up to 410 miles. Compared to the Cadillac Vistiq, the Rivian R1S is roughly 5 inches shorter, 5 inches narrower and 6 inches taller when set in the maximum ride height. The wheelbase of the R1S is just seven-tenths of an inch shorter than the Vistiq.
Cadillac’s new electric crossover comes as standard with a 23-speaker AKG Studio audio system with Dolby Atmos, as well as Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free advanced driving assistance system that works on hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in North America. 21-inch wheels are also part of the standard pack, as well as a five-zone climate control system.
2026 Cadillac Vistiq
Optionally, the luxury EV can be specced with adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering and 23-inch wheels–you know, if you want that extra pizzazz. A Night Vision feature can also be fitted as a paid-for extra, which allows the driver to see pedestrians or animals on the screen during the night.
A huge, 33-inch diagonal LED screen adorns the dashboard, just like on the larger Escalade IQ. Depending on the trim level, the Vistiq gets either carbon fiber, open-pore wood or black ash wood decors inside. Speaking of trim levels, three will be available: Luxury, Sport and Premium Luxury.
Cadillac says the third row of seating is “comfort-conscious,” with padded armrests, smartphone storage, cupholders and USB chargers. That’s nice to hear, seeing how traditional three-row SUVs usually greet their rear-most passengers with little more than a side window.
2026 Cadillac Vistiq
“From the start, it was our team’s goal to deliver a three-row SUV that provides exhilarating performance and intuitive technology, wrapped in the brand’s iconic design language,” said Jeff MacDonald, North American chief engineer for the Vistiq. “Bold, yet refined, the Vistiq provides a comfortable ride while handling like a much smaller vehicle, delivering a sense of isolated precision.”
We’ll learn more about the Vistiq as its market launch inches closer, including its more official EPA range estimates and detailed pricing. Until that happens, though, you can let us know what you think of GM’s latest EV in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran
The Polestar 2 Just Got More Expensive For 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/740590/polestar-2-2025-price-range/,"Blame tariffs or a shifting market, but the only Polestar 2 for 2025 is the Long-Range Dual-Motor Performance Pack at $66,200.",11/11/2024 14:14,"The Polestar 2 was one of the first electric vehicles to hit the market that really felt like it could match what Tesla was doing in terms of range, performance and technology. But as Volvo's corporate cousin Polestar continues the fight for EV supremacy, it's changing up its tactics when it steps into the ring for Round Two.
That may be bad news for anyone who has held out until model year 2025 to pick up a Polestar 2, however. The electric sedan will only be available in one trim level and configuration now, the most expensive one in the lineup. As Car and Driver discovered recently, the only 2025 Polestar 2 available to order new will be the Long Range, Dual Motor version with the Performance Pack. That means it will start at $64,800, or $66,200 including destination fees.
It unfortunately represents a sizable pricing jump from the 2024 Polestar 2, with far less flexibility in specs overall. That car could be had in Long-Range Rear-Wheel-Drive form starting at $51,300; Long-Range AWD form at $56,700; or the Long Range AWD Performance Pack that survived intact into 2025. (All prices include destination fees.) Last year, the Polestar 2 got a significant under-the-skin upgrade as well, going from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel-drive while getting upgraded motors, batteries and charging speeds. Those changes made it even better as one of our favorite Tesla alternatives and objectively one of the best sport sedans—electric or otherwise—on the market. And while the Polestar 2 never got to Tesla Model 3 levels of affordability, it did have some very enticing lease deals behind it since it did not qualify for any U.S. EV tax credits.
While these changes may be a bummer to some fans, they do make sense. The Polestar 2 is currently made in China, so its pricing appears to reflect the new 100% tariffs applied to EVs made in that country. Presumably, those tariffs caused the automaker to axe all but the most expensive versions of the car because it would've taken an absolute bath on anything else. And the pricing of the Polestar 2 now may mean the company is just eating the current tariffs. (We emailed Polestar representatives for comment and will update if we hear back.) Volvo did something similar with the also-China-made EX30: for now, until that car can be built in Europe, only its more expensive version will be sold stateside and potentially in limited quantities.
And it's also clear that Polestar's strategy is shifting away from the 2 to other models. As good as it is, it's always been a sedan in an SUV world, and sales have not been especially great lately—less than ideal as spent years as Polestar's sole model. Instead, Polestar seems to be emphasizing its future now: the Polestar 3 luxury crossover, and the upcoming Polestar 4 performance coupe-crossover.
Both will help Polestar avoid at least some of the pesky anti-China tariff problems. The Polestar 3 is being built right now in South Carolina alongside its mechanical cousin, the new Volvo EX90, and the Polestar 4 will be made in South Korea. The future of the Polestar 2 feels unclear, but the last we heard is that it could be replaced entirely with a sedan called the Polestar 7. Given how popular sedans are in other markets, including China, it's unlikely Polestar would go all-SUV just for Americans.
The good news is that if you want a Polestar 2, there are outstanding options on the used market right now. You can find a big glut of off-lease Polestar 2 sedans on Cars.com and other marketplaces for under $35,000 or even $30,000 (and if my own gas-powered Mazda 3 ever decides to eat it, I'll certainly be looking in that direction myself.)
And the 2025 Polestar 2 is, at the very least, a lot of car; you get 476 horsepower and 546 lb-ft of torque, max range of 254 miles, a zero to 60 mph time of four seconds flat, charging speeds up to 205 kW and a bunch of included options like Pilot Assist, the panoramic roof, a heat pump with heated seats and steering wheel, and more. Finally, with an adapter, it can now use the Tesla Supercharger network as well.
Is this still a solid deal for the Polestar 2, or would you go used instead?

"The Karma Invictus Is A Brand-New Car, Believe It Or Not",https://insideevs.com/news/740498/karma-invictus-performance-phev/,The ill-fated Fisker Karma lives on as a performance-oriented PHEV with carbon fiber bits.,11/11/2024 4:15,"After the somewhat ungracious downfall of Henrik Fisker’s latest automotive project, which ended with a widely reported bankruptcy case and thousands of Ocean EV owners desperately searching for answers, the idea that yet another Fisker-led automotive endeavor is in the works would be quite a sore point.
But rest assured, because this is not what it seems to be. This is the brand-new Karma Invictus, and it’s a freshly released performance version of the latest-generation Karma Revero plug-in hybrid. If the name Karma rings a bell, it’s because this car used to be manufactured by Fisker Automotive with a Karma badge on it. That company went bankrupt, as did Henrik Fisker’s second attempt at making a car from scratch, and its assets were scooped in 2014 up by another entity that chose to improve on the formula and continue selling the four-door sedan under a different name.
The Karma Invictus, then. It will be limited to just 30 units and each will come with carbon fiber front wheel arches, hood, roof and trunk. Under the skin, the Invictus gets Ohlins coil-overs with Swift sprints, an improved steering box that delivers more precise feedback.
More Stuff Like This
The powertrain is the same as in the regular Revero–a PHEV setup with two electric motors making a total of 536 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque, together with a 1.5-liter gas generator that has the job of providing energy to the 28-kilowatt-hour battery pack. However, because the Invictus is lighter than the latest Revero–though Karma didn’t say by how much–it can accelerate from zero to 60  miles per hour in an estimated 3.97 seconds, over half a second quicker than the model it’s based on.
The Invictus also wears sticky Michelin PS4S tires wrapped around black polished five-spoke forged aluminum wheels. The performance PHEV has 10-millimeter wider tires (295/35 R21) at the rear than at the front for improved grip. Karma Automotive says the Invictus is more predictable at the cornering limit and over uneven surfaces, which should make it a more involving drive.
Built in California, the Karma Invictus comes with anodized aluminum door sill plaques which can be inscribed to the client’s specifications. The seats–heated and ventilated at the front–are trimmed in an art-deco pattern reminiscent of New York’s Chrysler Building, the company said. Just like the Karma Revero it’s based on, the Invictus can travel up to 80 miles on all-electric power, while the total driving range with a full tank of gas is 360 miles.
“Karma Invictus takes an intense and visceral persona, amplifying its performance with a sharpened chassis paired with bespoke exterior and interior appointments to create a new identity for this legendary four-door GT,” said Marques McCammon, President, Karma Automotive. “As with the 3rd Generation Karma Revero, which begins delivering to clients later this month, Karma Invictus unleashes the potential of its space frame by marrying lightweight carbon fiber bodywork with our innovative hybrid Extended Range Electric powertrain.”
There’s no pricing or production timeline for the Invictus yet, but the luxury automaker said it will be available worldwide.",Iulian Dnistran
You've Never Seen An Audi Like This Before,https://insideevs.com/news/740248/audi-e-concept-shanghai-china/,Audi needs some wins in China. This wagon aims to do that 764 horsepower and 435 miles of electric range.,11/7/2024 15:20,"It's no secret that the Volkswagen Group has not had an amazing time in 2024. It's struggled with slumping sales in China, once its biggest market, while it faces intense Chinese competition back home. It's staring down factory closures and layoffs as costs mount. All the while, China's electric auto industry is powering forward while other parts of the world enter ""wait and see"" mode.
But today in Shanghai, Audi showed that it's not taking this situation lying down. Meet its latest concept and brand: the Audi E Concept, from AUDI. Yes, all-caps ""to signal both the connection to and differentiation from the sister brand,"" which in this case would simply be Audi. While that's certainly an odd branding decision that kind of reminds me of that old Marc Jacobs meme, the concept itself looks great, the specs are impressive and its mission is extremely clear: get right in China before it's too late.
AUDI E Concept
“By launching this new brand for electric and intelligent models in China, Audi is breaking new ground to tap into new and more tech-savvy customer segments,"" Audi's global CEO, Gernot Döllner, said in a news release. ""The upcoming models are aimed at a promising and simultaneously demanding new customer segment. The cooperation will further expand the Audi portfolio of battery electric vehicles in China and accelerate the company’s transformation in the world’s largest market.”
What is clear is that this electric concept is by China and for Chinese buyers. That's because appealing to that group has become a persistent problem for the Western automakers who once thought the world's largest car market would be a kind of permanent cash cow. Lately, that hasn't been the case. Homegrown Chinese automakers have not only dramatically advanced in EV and battery tech, but they also know how to appeal to the very particular tastes and likes of Chinese car owners: no buttons, lots of interior lighting, big screens, tons of connected tech and convenience features and more.
It's no wonder then that Audi partnered with China's SAIC for this one, which also includes an entirely new electric platform called the Advanced Digitized Platform. That should spawn at least three new full-size and midsize EVs, all getting to market 30% faster to match the lightning speed of China's other automakers.
AUDI E Concept
""The new joint program offers the best of two worlds in automotive development. It combines the strengths of Audi with SAIC’s innovation speed,"" the automaker said in a news release. ""Audi brings know-how in premium products and design, overall vehicle development, and engineering to the table. SAIC offers fast innovations, a well-established technology ecosystem, and deep insight into the local market’s demands.""
And the Audi E Concept is on the full-size side of things. It's a little longer than an Audi Q6 E-Tron crossover, about as wide and lower and sleeker overall. The grille is a radical departure from anything Audi's done in the past, ditching the iconic four-ring logo for the name in all-caps. (I'd also argue it looks a bit more interesting than Audi's current, overly fussy design language.)
AUDI E Concept
The specs are where it really shines. The concept car has a 100 kWh battery and dual-motor all-wheel-drive estimated at 700 km (435 miles) of electric range on China's generous CLTC testing cycle. It has an 800-volt architecture and can supposedly add a staggering 230 miles of range in 10 minutes. It's quick, too, with 764 horsepower and a zero to 60 mph time of 3.6 seconds.
On the inside, drivers and passengers get a ""pillar-to-pillar"" 4K curved display, digital mirrors, very few buttons and an ""AUDI OS"" software setup with facial recognition, an AI virtual assistant and other customizable tech features. In short, it feels like something from Xiaomi or Nio, but from Audi.
AUDI E Concept
And that's exactly the point. This is why Audi wanted to team up with SAIC in the first place. While it's still ramping up modern EVs for customers in the U.S. and Europe, to compete in China, it needs to play the same game those competitors are playing right now. I remember a time when a China-specific model would mean cringey dragon graphics and things like that; now, the automakers are catching up after getting leapfrogged on technology.
Will these Audi E models make their way to Europe and the U.S.? Given the current backlash with tariffs and crackdowns on software, I find the latter especially unlikely. But I wish Audi would find some way to get this tech to trickle down elsewhere, because it definitely seems to be in a different league.

The Carmaker Behind The Shelby Cobra Is Building A Brand-New Retro-Flavored EV,https://insideevs.com/news/740140/ac-ace-classic-ev-roadster-tremec/,"It’s called the AC Ace Classic Electric and it’s beautiful. It’s also very light, despite packing a 72-kWh battery.",11/7/2024 4:14,"Your eyes are not deceiving you, rest assured. The delightfully simple red roadster you see above is not some sort of Shelby Cobra knockoff, but it does have a lot in common with the legendary name that established the United States as a serious contender on the international racing stage, winning the FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1965.
That’s because it’s made by AC Cars, the company that supplied the chassis to Shelby, who then fitted the signature Ford V8 and transmission stateside. But unlike the iconic Cobra, this little red thing is electric.
It’s called the AC Ace Classic Electric and it’s a brand-new car made in collaboration with car parts giant Tremec. Tipping the scales at just 2,425 pounds, the British EV has a hand-laid carbon fiber body and a hand-finished interior. It’s very similar to the original AC Ace that provided the base for the brawny Shelby Cobra but without the aggressive flaring and side exhausts.
The reinterpreted classic is powered by a Tremec-developed drivetrain. A single, rear-mounted electric motor makes 301 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, enough to propel the skinny EV to 62 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. A rather beefy 72-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides “over 200 miles” of range and can be DC fast charged, although the company didn’t say how many kilowatts it can accept from a Level 3 stall.
AC Cars says the Ace Electric has a 50:50 front-to-rear weight distribution, which means it should be quite nimble on a twisty track–the low weight also helps. Two versions will be available: the Ace Classic Electric with the open grille design of the original Ace and the Ace Bristol Classic Electric with the earlier “smiling face” that debuted back in 1953. That said, AC Cars, which describes itself as Britain’s oldest active vehicle manufacturer, also offers a bespoke service for clients who want to customize their EV.
The electric AC Ace Classic is on display at the Tremec stand at this year’s SEMA show in Las Vegas. Production is set to start next year with an initial run of just 45 units, each with a starting price of $275,000 before taxes. The retro-flavored EV will be available in both left- and right-hand drive and each car will come with a brand-new VIN.

"The Volvo EX30 Is Finally Coming To America At $44,900",https://insideevs.com/news/740089/volvo-ex30-us-debut-price/,"After getting spiked by tariffs earlier this year, the still-China-built EX30 will arrive in dual-motor form soon.",11/6/2024 15:52,"The Volvo EX30 is finally coming to America. Yes, really.
Volvo Cars USA announced today that deliveries of the compact electric crossover will start going to people who pre-ordered them last year. And the U.S.-spec EX30 comes with a familiar price tag as well: $44,900 (or $46,195 including destination) for what Volvo said is its most requested trim level, the 422 hp EX30 Twin Motor Performance.
A Volvo spokesperson confirmed the EX30 is still being built at parent company Geely Group's factory in Zhangjiakou, China, so that price does include the new 100% tariffs on Chinese-built EVs—the reason the car was delayed earlier this summer. The EX30's configurator has also returned to Volvo's U.S. website. For those who pre-ordered the cars, deliveries will begin ""before the end of this year,"" the automaker said in a news release.
The dual-motor all-wheel-drive EX30 can be had in Plus trim or the more loaded Ultra version, which adds Park Pilot Assist Pilot Assist, Lane Change Assist and other features for $47,895, including destination.
Interestingly, the $44,900 base price for the Twin Motor Performance version is right in line with what Volvo announced earlier this year, so its price seemingly did not increase with the tariffs. Volvo initially announced the Single Motor Extended Range model would start at $34,950, making it the cheapest Volvo on sale. That version will come in 2025, Volvo said; its updated pricing has not been announced.
At the same time, Volvo seems to be hedging its bets somewhat on deliveries of the China-built EX30 models. Automotive News reported that it “remains to be seen” if the U.S. will receive additional China-made EX30s beyond this initial shipment: “If there is a way that we can get a few more cars through, we may take that,” said Jim Nichols, head of Product and Technology Consumer Offer at Volvo Car USA. “We also want to see what the response is going to be with our reservation holders.”
In other words, the car may really begin selling in force in 2025 when its production is moved to Ghent, Belgium. That may not begin until the third quarter of 2025 as well.
The EX30 has had a wild ride to get here. The car debuted in New York in July 2023 where it wowed onlookers with its compact size, sleek looks and $35,000-ish starting price tag. Volvo initially planned to build the car in China in order to achieve that low cost; it's the most affordable Volvo ever made. The specs were impressive, too. The Single Motor Extended Range EX30 has 268 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque with a range of 275 miles, while the Twin Motor Performance has 422 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. Volvo claimed that model can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds, also making it Volvo’s quickest-ever production car. Many excited fans—myself included, once—put in pre-orders for the car not long after its debut.
But the EX30 quickly fell victim to geopolitics. When the Biden administration announced steeper tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, Volvo hit pause on its debut plans to figure out how, when and even if the car could be sold stateside. At the time, many assumed those tariffs would mean a much higher price than initially announced. While Volvo had always planned to also build the EX30 in Belgium to satisfy anticipated European demand for the car, that now seems to be the linchpin on which U.S. volume sales will ultimately depend. (The EX30 is currently on sale in both Canada and Mexico.)
It is, however, great news for EX30 fans who worried they would miss out. The car has since garnered rave reviews, awards and is racking up strong sales in Europe and elsewhere. Can it eventually pull off a repeat here? Time will tell, but for now, Americans are finally getting the great option they wanted.

Suzuki Boss Says Making The Jimny An EV Would “Ruin” It. But Would It?,https://insideevs.com/news/739973/suzuki-jimny-ev-not-happening/,"A light, fun, cheap all-electric Jimny would make a lot of sense, albeit a short-range one.",11/6/2024 3:34,"Suzuki hasn’t sold a new car in the United States since 2012, but in other parts of the world, it’s still alive and kicking. That said, what is arguably the Japanese automaker’s most recognizable model, the venerable Jimny, isn’t the shining star it used to be.
In Europe, Suzuki has been forced to sell the pint-sized off-roader exclusively as a commercial vehicle in a two-seater configuration, which limits its already shrinking market. As fun and quirky as the Jimny may be–and it excels in both these categories–it’s still a slow, boxy off-roader that sits on an old-school ladder frame chassis and uses solid axles front and rear. The fact that it’s powered by a relatively asthmatic 1.5-liter gasoline engine doesn’t help either.
I’d argue that the Jimny–the Samurai’s successor–is the perfect candidate for electrification. A cheap, small and fun off-roader would be a great alternative to open-top side-by-sides or UTVs, but Suzuki boss Toshihiro Suzuki begs to differ. Speaking during the launch of the all-new eVitara, the automaker’s first EV, the automaker’s head honcho suggested that a battery-powered Jimny is out of the question.
More Stories Like This
“If you talk about the Jimny EV, I think it would ruin the best part of the Jimny,” Suzuki said, quoted by Autocar. “I think the core strength of the Jimny is the right weight.” He added that the company intends to continue offering the Jimny to “professionals” (i.e. commercial customers) and that using e-fuel or biofuel would enable the off-roader to stay on sale for longer.
Let’s address that weight problem, though. The latest-generation gas-powered Jimny tips the scales at an impressively low 2,414 pounds for the two-door version and 2,612 pounds for the four-door version. (Yes, there’s a four-door, too.) By comparison, the new eVitara, which is a unibody crossover, starts at 3,752 lbs for the standard-range, two-wheel drive trim and goes all the way to 4,186 lbs for the long-range, four-wheel drive variant.
That’s a big difference, but an all-electric Jimny could make do with a smaller battery. The eVitara can be had with either a 49- or a 61-kilowatt-hour battery, but let’s not forget that the entry-level Nissan Leaf comes with a 40-kWh pack, so why wouldn’t the Jimny go down the same route? Obviously, the range would take a hit, but there are plenty of people out there commuting in the 149-mile base Leaf. Add a bit of Jimny fun to the mix, and a potentially winning formula comes into view.
It’s not like the gas-powered Jimny is a highway cruiser anyway, with a rather bumpy ride and noisy interior. Making it electric would only make it better, but what do you think?",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Deliveries Begin In Canada As U.S. Demand Cools,https://insideevs.com/news/739906/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-canada/,"Tesla made the Cybertruck available for preorder in Canada in August starting, at $137,990 CAD.",11/5/2024 13:00,"With the high number of Tesla Cybertruck sightings from Canada popping up online, it can only mean one thing: Tesla has officially kicked off deliveries up north. In Canada, the Cybertruck currently costs $137,990 CAD in dual-motor guise or $165,990 for the tri-motor Cyberbeast. There’s an additional $2,750 CAD destination fee that you need to add on top of that.
Only the Foundation Series is currently available in Canada, but it’s been dropped in the U.S. making it $20,000 cheaper, we anticipate that Canada will soon follow suit and allow you to order a more affordable non-Foundation Series truck. Don't expect an even lower price, though, as the $61,000 single-motor rear-wheel-drive model is likely no longer in the cards.
The Cybertruck order books in Canada were opened in August. However, regardless of when you placed your order, you shouldn't have to wait months for a Cybertruck's delivery—your truck should arrive within a few weeks now that the backlog of orders in the U.S. has cleared. The Canadian version of the Tesla website estimates delivery in either November or December.
The delivery schedule is for the Foundation Series, and Tesla is able to deliver these trucks so quickly because it’s probably already shipped them over to Canada. You may have to wait longer for a non-Foundation Series truck to become available in Canada.
More Tesla Cybertruck Stories
If you want the Range Extender (which is just an extra battery, not an actual generator that uses fuel to add miles), it will set you back CAD 22,000. It increases the dual-motor truck’s range from 512 kilometers (337 miles) to over 755 km (445 miles), but its production has been pushed back to the middle of 2025.
Making the Cybertruck legal for Canadian roads required an exemption since the country currently prohibits vehicles with steer-by-wire on its public roads. Apparently, the issue was that the steering wheels of vehicles registered in Canada needed to turn 270 degrees for them to be legal, and the Cybertruck’s didn’t. Interestingly, the exemption remains in place only until 2029, so these trucks could become illegal to drive in a few years unless the law changes in the meantime.
While the exemption is in place, Tesla will have to supply Transport Canada with regular incident reports about the steer-by-wire system as well as the intervention of the truck’s electronic stability control. The manufacturer is limiting Cybertruck sales to North America this year, but starting in 2025 it wants to expand sales elsewhere, especially in Europe, where grey imports are already underway. It's not yet clear whether the Cybertruck is legal for European roads and whether it will ever officially go on sale on the continent without serious changes.

The Chevrolet Silverado EV Is Getting A Diagonal Driving Feature,https://insideevs.com/news/739674/chevrolet-silverado-ev-sidewinder-diagonal-steering/,"A software update will enable older Silverado EVs to move diagonally, just like the GMC Hummer EV and Sierra EV.",11/4/2024 3:29,"The 2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV recently debuted with more range and a lower starting price, making it an even more appealing option than ever. However, General Motors, Chevrolet’s parent company, has another ace up its sleeve in the all-electric pickup game. (Or maybe it just forgot to mention this cool new feature you saw in the headline, I don’t know.)
It’s called Sidewinder, and it’s exactly the same as the GMC Hummer EV’s CrabWalk feature, just under a different name. Seeing how the more expensive Silverado EV trims come as standard with four-wheel steering, the newly added Sidewinder showpiece enables the battery-powered truck to move diagonally by turning all four wheels in the same direction.
Drivers can enable the feature from the Rear Steering page on the central infotainment screen and drive like a crab at up to 20 miles per hour, according to GM. It should come in handy, especially in tight parking spaces and off-road.
Sidewinder comes as standard on the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST, while the 2024 Silverado EV RST First Edition will receive the feature via an over-the-air software update–including vehicles that are still on dealer lots and those that have been sold.
The Silverado EV was GM’s only electric pickup that didn’t have a diagonal driving feature, even though it comes with rear-wheel steering. The GMC Hummer EV broke the ice with the so-called “CrabWalk,” followed by the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1.
Revealed last month, the updated Silverado EV offers even more range than before–up to 492 miles for the fleet-oriented WT trim with the Max Range battery pack–and a lower starting price of $57,095 including destination for the entry-level WT with the newly introduced Standard Range battery pack. We still don’t know how far the base Work Truck will go on a full charge, as Chevrolet has yet to publish that figure.
Meanwhile, the retail-oriented LT with the Extended Range battery starts at $75,195. This one is EPA-rated at 408 miles on a full charge, while the fancier RST trim with the same battery is rated at 390 miles. The RST is also the most expensive of the bunch, with a starting price of $89,395. The RST with Max Range battery, which enables a GM-estimated range of 460 miles, will set you back $97,895.

Hyundai Initium Hydrogen Concept Shows Where Design Is Headed Next,https://insideevs.com/news/739422/hyundai-initium-concept-design-language/,It’s powered by a hydrogen fuel cell that provides a maximum range of 404 miles. And it can power your home.,10/31/2024 9:00,"Hyundai is changing its design language again, even though it didn’t even get to implement its last one across its entire global lineup. The new styling direction, which is called “Art of Steel,” looks like an evolution of what Hyundai has been doing with its Ioniq range of models with a bit more of a retro influence. And it will be previewed by a hydrogen-powered concept that not only looks interesting but can do some interesting things.
That concept is called the Hyundai Initium, which will be unveiled at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Powering the concept is a hydrogen fuel cell system that runs a 201 horsepower motor and it gives the Initium a claimed range of 404 miles (650 km) on one tank. That’s more than its predecessor, the Nexo, which could only manage 378 miles (609 km) and had 40 horsepower less.
Hyundai actually intends to produce the Initium starting in 2025, presumably as a replacement for the Nexo FCEV introduced in 2018, which in turn served as a replacement for the iX35 FCEV. Just like its hydrogen fuel cell predecessors, which only sold a couple thousand cars a year globally at best (most of them in South Korea), the Initium FCEV won’t be an important model for Hyundai on the world stage. But it will be important from a technology perspective—Hyundai, along with a few other automakers, aren't giving up on hydrogen fuel cells even as they invest vastly more resources into battery EVs.
The Initium’s design is pretty bold, with excellent proportions, bulging wheel arches and simple fascias that feature light clusters with a pixel-like design. The C-pillar area must have been inspired by the Pontiac Aztek, because it looks very similar, including its slanted fastback-style rear glass. The concept’s 21-inch wheels feature aerodynamic covers to help reduce drag, but they also look pretty sporty as far as aero wheels go.
More Hyundai EV Stories
According to Hyundai’s design boss, SangYup Lee, ""Our challenge began from the manufacturing stage, where we pushed the formability of steel to the extreme to create a form of art. With Initium, we’ve crafted a more SUV-like design that is both solid and safe, reflecting our dedication to our customers through 'customer-centric design’.” Hyundai is getting ready to reveal an updated version of the Ioniq 6, which may incorporate some elements of the “Art of Steel” design.
Hyundai Initium concept
While much of the focus for hydrogen power has turned to commercial vehicles, large trucks and industrial applications, Hyundai is one of the few automakers that thinks it could have legs for passenger cars. The Koreans are committed to keeping hydrogen in the lineup as a way to help them achieve the goal of meeting its net zero carbon goals by 2045.
The manufacturer doesn’t say if the Initium is built on a new platform or a modified version of an existing one, but like Hyundai’s EVs, it will have bidirectional charging with vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities. A Hyundai official told Car and Driver that the Initium's 100 kWh of offboard juice is ""enough to power a typical Korean home for around 10 days.""
Will buyers warm up to this hydrogen vehicle more than others? As always, that may depend on the infrastructure, but at least the Initium has route-planning for that as well. Let's hope it will actually have stations to find when it goes on sale.",Andrei Nedelea
Very Original: Mopar EV-Swapped Plymouth GTX,https://www.motor1.com/news/739152/mopar-plymouth-gtx-electromod/,"The GTX Electromod showcases a potential EV conversion kit, so you too can remove the one thing that defines a classic muscle car.",12/25/2024 9:02,"Among the many gasoline and electric vehicles on display at SEMA this year will be a deliciously blue 1967 Plymouth GTX. Don't get excited about the wild V-8 engine under the hood of this modified muscle car, however. In its place is a single electric motor driving the rear wheels.
It's called the Plymouth GTX Electromod Concept, and it comes from Mopar, the decades-old parts division of Chrysler that is now the parts group for all of Stellantis. Back in the 1960s, Mopar dished out all kinds of performance upgrades for pretty much every V-8 in the Chrysler family. That includes the GTX, which debuted in 1967 as a humble Belvedere two-door hardtop muscled up with two engine options: a 375-horsepower 440 cubic inch (7.2) V-8, or the legendary 426 Hemi.
Flash forward to 2024, and Mopar is testing the waters with a conceptual electric conversion kit for classic cars. Called the e-Crate, it's not unlike the various Hellcat setups currently available for custom builds. At the heart is a 400-volt, 250-kilowatt electric drive module that installs neatly under the hood using custom mounts. Power comes from four battery packs, three of which are mounted in the trunk. The fourth is positioned up front behind the grille for better weight distribution, which is important considering each pack weighs 230 pounds. The system is rated for 73 kilowatt-hours and gives the GTX an estimated range of 250 miles.
But range and efficiency were never defining factors for a muscle car. It's all about power, and on that front, this GTX Electromod makes ""approximately 335 horsepower and torque,"" according to Mopar. That's less than the car's original 440, never mind the Hemi. There is no transmission; it goes to the rear wheels through a 3:1 gear reducer. So at least there's very little (if any) driveline loss. Performance stats aren't mentioned.
The rest of the car features typical restomod upgrades. It has a lowered suspension with 18-inch wheels and Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners. A custom hood is made from carbon fiber, and at the back, the wheel arches are wider. Bumpers front and rear are trimmed for a cleaner fit, and you won't find a lick of chrome anywhere. The blue interior has some personality, with bronze and stainless steel trim on the dash and door panels. There are new seats, a new center console, and digital gauges behind a retro-themed steering wheel. The Mopar team also added a cupholder, because all muscle cars need a cupholder.
This certainly isn't the first time we've seen a major automaker EV-swap a classic muscle car. And with the future still rolling (albeit slower) towards electric power, we doubt this will be the last.

2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/739100/2026-cadillac-lyriq-v/,"Cadillac's award-winning crossover is about to put the ""V"" in ""EV,"" and we're all better for it. The performance variant debuts next year.",10/29/2024 8:00,"I think even the most die-hard electric vehicle fan has to admit that General Motors has put out some truly first-rate gas-powered performance cars over the past decade-and-a-half. The C7 and C8 Corvettes, the last (for now, anyway) Chevy Camaro and the various Cadillac V-Series sedans have taken on the world and often come out on top. But GM has also had a surprisingly strong EV game as of late. I've been wondering when those two trends might converge, and today, we have an answer.
Meet the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V. Its somewhat awkward name tells you exactly what it is: the award-winning Cadillac Lyriq electric crossover, just with the V-Series treatment for high performance.
2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V
""The 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V, the first electric SUV to earn the V-Series badge, will join the brand portfolio early next year,"" Cadillac officials said in a news release. ""Lyriq-V is a stunning technical achievement, pushing the performance pedigree of the preeminent sub-brand to new heights.""
So what else do we know about it? Well, for now, nothing. That's it. Just that and a short teaser video of a Lyriq-V whooshing almost silently across a race track. We can see several exterior tweaks, including a different grille and color-matched wheel arches, and V badges inside and out. And the teaser video clearly shows the driver activating some kind of performance settings with the V button on the steering wheel. Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see what Cadillac is cooking up.
We have some things we can deduce, of course. The normal dual-motor all-wheel-drive Lyriq is no slouch with 500 horsepower and a zero to 60 mph time under five seconds (plus a healthy 307 miles of electric range.) The Lyriq-V could also end up as a Chevrolet Blazer EV SS in a business suit; that crossover will pack 595 horsepower and be capable of zero to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds with its full-blast ""Wide Open Watts"" mode engaged. But given the lengths Cadillac's V-Series team has gone in the past to make those cars feel special, I don't think the Lyriq-V will be just some reskin of the Chevy.
I'm quite excited to see what GM comes up with here, and even more glad the V-Series will have a future in the electric era. But GM set the bar pretty high with the CTS-V and the like; if the Lyriq-V can live up to that legacy, it's going to be a very interesting machine indeed.

Hyundai Gave The Kona A Weird Off-Road Makeover,https://www.motor1.com/news/738706/hyundai-kona-off-road-version/,It's named after the Earth's largest active volcano and looks like a 1990s base model.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Seemingly out of nowhere, there's a limited-run special edition of the electric Kona in Japan. Hyundai calls it the ""Mauna Loa"" after the biggest active volcano in the world. Painted in Mirage Green, the small crossover has been turned into a pseudo-offroader with Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires.
The chunky rubber measures 205/65 R16 and is combined with matte black wheels supplied by Weds. For better off-road chops, Hyundai installs smaller wheels compared to the regular model's 17-inch set with 215/60 R17 tires. We're not entirely sure whether that was the intention but the new wheels seem to mimic bedlock wheels used by proper go-anywhere vehicles.
Addressing the elephant in the room, the bumpers and side skirts make the Mauna Loa look like a base model from the 1990s. While those cars had unpainted bumpers to keep the price low, the Kona's are sprayed with scratch-resistant paint. That should make the body panels more durable when you’re off the beaten path in your electric Kona. Hyundai calls it a ""unique uneven finish"" with a textured look that has a ""subdued shine.""
Rounding off the upgrades on the outside are mudguards on all four wheels, black weatherstripping, dark badges, and standard roof bars for extra practicality. Stepping inside, Hyundai installs easy-to-clean floor mats and a cargo mat made from rubber as well. Much like the body, the interior is also predominantly green but with neon yellow accents for a contrasting effect.
Although the Kona Mauna Loa caters to outdoorsy people, Hyundai insisted on covering the seats in leather upholstery. We'd reckon cloth would've made more sense since it's easier to clean and more durable in time. Elsewhere, customers can get a few more accessories, including a folding chair and storage pockets that can be attached to the back of the front seats. Two different-sized cargo boxes are also available.
Hyundai is making only 30 units of the Kona Mauna Loa and is charging 4.95 million yen. At current exchange rates, that works out to about $32,500, making it about $2,800 more expensive than the electric Kona Voyage upon which it's based. It has the bigger 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for 336 miles.

"Scout Traveler And Terra: Off-Road EVs That Offer Gas Generators, Too",https://insideevs.com/news/738669/scout-traveler-terra-revealed/,"Scout's first EVs will offer incredible off-road capability, direct-consumer sales and zero range anxiety. We're excited.",10/24/2024 18:30,"I've waited a long time to see what Scout, Volkswagen's revived off-road brand, would bring to the table. The company made big promises: The return of a storied nameplate, a new chance for VW to build real momentum in America, new software, a new factory and extreme off-road capability. But I had my doubts. I don't trust VW's vision as a company, and I wasn't sure if Scout could stick the landing. But with the reveal of the Terra truck and Traveler SUV on Thursday, Scout blew away my expectations. The company made all of the right decisions. The products look great.
More Scout Info
They offer pure-EV or ""extended-range EV"" powertrains, with 350 miles of all-electric range and up to 500 miles when using the available gasoline generator. The designs look great, the interiors look solid, the capability looks promising and the charging specs look incredible. They're built in America with battery sourcing that ensures they'll qualify for the full $7,500 federal incentive, and the pricing looks about right. The Terra and Traveler have everything they need to succeed in America. Scout just has to get them to market. Both are technically ""concepts"" for now, but they look nearly production-ready.
Let's jump into what they are, why they matter and the road ahead.
Scout is a beloved name in the off-road community, as the original International Harvester Scout was a phenomenal off-roader. It was simple, durable and capable, and a perfect inspiration for an off-road brand. When the Volkswagen Group acquired the rights to the Scout name upon purchasing the heavy duty trucking firm that controlled International, the company took the opportunity to launch a redefined brand for an electric era. The company announced the name a couple of years back, and now we finally know about the products.
The Traveler and Terra are two separate products, but the fundamentals are the same. They are both body-on-frame vehicles built on an EV-oriented truck platform, bespoke to Scout. Scout says they'll take advantage of ""zonal architectures,"" a design term borrowed from new VW partner Rivian, which uses the new method of construction to simplify production and service while cutting costs. But the Scout's electrical architecture is more advanced than even the Rivian R1's, with an 800-volt-class system enabling increased efficiency and blinding-fast charging.
The Traveler, Scout's SUV.
If you don't want to worry about public fast charging, though, Scout is selling an ""extended-range electric vehicle"" version of the Terra and Traveler. The ""EREV""—a term popularized by the upcoming Ram Ramcharger—incorporates a gasoline generator to charge the battery. In a nod to the brand's history, Scout calls the gasoline generator the ""Harvester."" It never directly powers the wheels, though, separating this from a hybrid design.
The EREV design means that the Scout can go up to 500 miles on a charge and a tank. Opt for the EV-only version of either the Terra or the Traveler and you'll get up to 350 miles of range, putting them roughly on par with existing long-range trucks. Charge times should be considerably faster than the segment average, though. Scout says the Terra and Traveler support up to 350-kW charging speeds, maxing out the fastest chargers you'll find today. There's no claim for a 10-80% charging time, but expect it to land well under 30 minutes. Sub-20 minutes seems possible. The Scouts will come with Tesla's North American Charging System (NACS) plug from the factory, too, so you'll be able to charge at Superchargers from the rip.
Scout will offer a dual-motor four-wheel-drive system The company says there will be a solid rear axle—something beloved by hard-core off-roaders and unavailable in any EV off-roader so far—and mechanically locking front and rear differentials.
The Terra pickup truck gets a 5.5-foot bed.
Those top-end trucks should be able to knock off the 0-60 sprint in 3.5 seconds, thanks to ""nearly 1,000 lb-ft of torque,"" per the release. Perhaps more relevant to truck buyers, the Terra will be able to tow over 10,000 lbs. The Traveler—that's the SUV—will be limited to a bit over 7,000 lbs of towing capacity, which is unsurprising as shorter-wheelbase SUVs almost always tow less than their long-wheelbase, pickup truck counterparts. Both offer 2,000 lbs of payload, which shames any internal-combustion midsize pickup on sale. So you shouldn't have to worry about how much gear you bring on your overlanding trips.
Speaking of which, Scout says both trucks will offer over a foot of ground clearance in their most capable specifications. They can fit 35-inch tires and ford three feet of water. Finally, they can power all of your gear with a plethora of 120-volt outlets and USB-C ports. The Terra will even offer a 240-volt outlet in its 5.5-foot pickup bed with enough oomph to power construction tools and appliances. Both vehicles offer a full-size spare, too, which is huge for off-roading. Scout also says the frunk of both the Terra and Traveler are big enough to fit a bag of golf clubs, or a cooler.
Scout was clear to InsideEVs: The company isn't going to make the same mistake as many competitors (and even its parent company) in eschewing buttons completely. The Terra and Traveler offer tough-looking buttons for key controls, with rugged-looking accents throughout the interior.
Scout's all-new software interface will be called ""Scout Community UX."" The company says you won't have to dig through menus to access core features.
The concept images show an awesome design inside, with brown leather/leatherette seats and fabric accents. It's a good mix of clean, modern design with user-friendly accents. It remains to be seen whether Scout can stick the landing on software, which has proven to be a pain point for VW. But Scout's doing its own work here, and may benefit from the new tie-in with Rivian.
But this isn't a vehicle that's going to be defined by its tech. Instead, it offers another selling point to its outdoorsy clientele. The Traveler will offer a retractable ""Cabana Top"" that provides a giant opening to the outdoors. It's the size of a large panoramic roof, but fully opening. Scout claims it will be one of the largest roof opening in any SUV. If you don't want that, though, you can get a panoramic roof.
There will also be a three-person front bench seat available, which I absolutely love. It'll even be available on higher trims, so you don't need a stripper-spec work truck to have six-passenger utility. That alone has put the Scout Terra on my ""want to own"" list.
The Traveler's optional open-air ""Cabana Top.""
Here, I was expecting bad news. Scout is promising a lot, and over-promising can lead to cost growth pretty quickly. But I think the price is reasonable: Including tax credits, the Traveler will start ""as low as $50,000."" The pickup version will star around $51,500, also with the tax credit factored in. Ignoring the tax credit—which could change at any time—both vehicles will start under $60,000.
That's a reasonable price for this kind of vehicle. Many Jeep Wrangler, Ford Bronco and Toyota 4Runner customers already pay over $50,000. The Toyota Land Cruiser starts in the mid-$50,000 range, too.
It looks great. It also looks like a Rivian.
The real question is whether the $50,000 version will be a vehicle you want. The 1,000 lb-ft truck with the range extender sounds incredible. But it's too early to know whether Scout can deliver the experience customers want for $50,000. I can easily see the real-world price being in the $60,000 range for most models. But Scout's top-end EVs will have one huge advantage over the most sought-after Wrangler 392s, Bronco Raptors and 4Runner TRD Pros.
The Scout Terra and Traveler will be sold directly to consumers via factory stores. That means fixed pricing and no markups, something that can be hard to avoid on many of the Scout's most desirable competitors.
But that also poses a risk: Scout will have to deploy stores quickly, especially if it wants to capture more rural buyers who will be most excited by an off-roader. The company also needs to find a way to differentiate itself from Rivian, another EV adventure brand with zonal architectures and, likely, similar software. The range extender and price should separate it from the R1, but Rivian plans to launch the smaller, more affordable R2 before either Scout reaches the market.
The Traveler gets a swing-out full-size spare tire. On the Terra, the full-size spare will live under the bed.
Direct-to-consumer brands have also struggled to develop their service networks fast enough. But Scout says 80% of repairs on either truck should be doable outside of a Scout service center, ""whether in a driveway or while adventuring."" If Scout is able to leverage VW's existing service network, that could be a huge advantage, but there's no word on that yet. Scout also says the stores will offer a variety of accessories, including bumpers with exposed recovery points, auxiliary lighting options and even winches.
Now the bad news: Not until 2027. Scout says initial production will begin at its South Carolina factory sometime in that year, but that's all we know. If low-volume production starts in late 2027, it could leave most buyers waiting until 2028 for their vehicles.
Both the Terra and Traveler look sophisticated, interesting and competitive now. But it's hard to know where the market will be in 2027. Nobody knows if tax credits will still exist by then. Rivian could also be a mainstream company by then, or it could be gone. Tesla could be an AI company primarily making robots, or a reborn automaker with an adult at the helm.
Wouldn't be a 2020's vehicle without a full-width light bar and a light-up badge, now, would it?
So we don't know what sort of market the Terra and Traveler will enter. But right now, both products look exactly on target. Scout has managed to carve out a beautiful niche, as a tech-forward, ground-up company with the experience and resources of a giant global automaker. It's approached these vehicles with an incredible clarity of purpose, and it's possible that it'll be one of the few truly successful, direct-to-consumer, EV-focused companies in the U.S. But first, it has to hold our attention for the next three years.
That's a tall order, but I've learned not to underestimate Scout. If you like it, and you believe in the company, you can reserve one today here.
Correction: 10/25/24 at 1:40 P.M.: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Scout Terra and Traveler would offer quad-motor four-wheel-drive systems, with a motor per axle. That is incorrect. The Scouts will offer four-wheel drive with two motors, one on each axle. The story has been updated to be accurate. We regret the error.

Scout Terra And Traveler Livestream Debut Replay: Watch It Here,https://insideevs.com/news/738652/scout-motors-livestream-debut-how-to-watch/,An iconic American off-road brand will be resurrected today in an all-electric avatar. Join us at 5 P.M. EST for the livestream.,10/24/2024 14:30,"Americans have a thing for big, beefy trucks and SUVs and in a few years, they might have two new ones to pick from, thanks to a legendary nameplate: Scout Motors.
When the Volkswagen Group acquired Navistar in 2021 (successor to International Harvester which created the first Scout vehicles in the 1960s), it saw a real opportunity with the brand. Scout EVs are expected to have truly American personalities with a focus on off-road capability.
And they will have one thing many EVs don't in today's world: actual physical buttons. A rare find in today's minimalist touchscreen-dominated cabins.
Scout EVs will be made right here in the U.S. at an upcoming $2 billion plant in South Carolina. While the EVs themselves are years away—production is expected to start in 2027—we had the chance to check out the Scout Traveler electric SUV and Terra pickup truck today at Scout's inaugural event in Nashville.
As always, InsideEVs is reporting from the ground, so stick around for all the updates. You can watch the live stream above starting at 5 p.m. EDT/ 4 p.m. CDT.

The 2025 Ford E-Transit Costs The Same As The Gas Version,https://insideevs.com/news/738554/2025-ford-e-transit-price-range-specs/,"That’s the upfront cost. When you factor in the potential incentives and much lower running costs, the numbers are even better.",10/24/2024 3:33,"The 2025 Ford E-Transit electric van is here, and I’ll be honest: There isn’t really any technical change compared to the outgoing model. However, it’s in the pricing department where things get interesting because the 2025 E-Transit costs the same as “comparable” gas-powered Transit models, according to Ford.
The (very lightly) updated electric commercial van starts at $51,000. The 2025 E-Transit Chassis Cab goes for $46,200 and the Cutaway model starts at an even lower $47,700.
But it gets better. Ford is also throwing in a $2,000 rebate toward an EV charger and the associated installation costs. Additionally, the electric van is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit for commercial vehicles and the running costs are significantly lower than the gas version–a reduction of up to 48% in scheduled maintenance, according to Ford.
More Electric Vans
So, what’s new for 2025? Well, customers can now outfit the E-Transit with one of four ready-made, factory-installed trade packages made by third-party accessory supplier Ranger Design.
There’s a $4,370 Electrician pack with drawers and bins to store parts and reels to hand bundles of wires. The $4,440 HVAC trade package comes with large shelves and storage bins, as well as specialized refrigerant storage racks and restraints. The General Contractor pack meanwhile starts at $2,900 and includes a mix of multipurpose shelves, bins, drawers and hooks. And finally, there’s a $3,300 Folding Shelving Package with deep, large-capacity folding shelves designed for delivery services.
New options are also available, such as the Wall Liner Kit for regular or long-length body types, as well as the Large Grab Handles Kit for the two D-pillars for easier access in the back.
The Mobile Power Cord is optional but includes a fast charging adapter that can be used to top-up the E-Transit at Tesla Superchargers. Ford also made the Smart Acceleration Truncation option a standalone item for fleet customers. The feature limits the van’s acceleration by automatically calculating the payload for a smooth start every time, regardless of driver skill or load.
The 2025 E-Transit comes as standard with 180-degree opening 50/50 rear-hinged doors on all low- and medium-roof cargo vans and all passenger vans. All high-roof cargo vans get 253-degree opening doors as standard, but they can be specced as an option on all low- and medium-roof versions.
As with the outgoing model, the 2025 Ford Transit is powered by an 89-kilowatt-hour battery pack that sends juice to a single, rear-mounted electric motor that’s good for 266 horsepower and 317 pound-feet of torque. The low-roof models have an estimated range of 159 miles on  a full charge, while the medium roof lowers the estimate to 148 miles and the high roof to 143 miles.
The battery can be charged from an AC source at up to 19.2 kilowatts for a 0-to-100% top-up in six hours and 11 minutes (on an 80-amp circuit). The maximum DC fast charging rate is 176 kW, with the low-roof van gaining 67 miles of range in just 15 minutes from a compatible stall.",Iulian Dnistran
"The 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali Gets More Range, Cheaper Base Price",https://insideevs.com/news/737361/2025-gmc-sierra-ev-specs/,"That was fast. For 2025, GMC's electric truck gets more flexibility and some colors, too.",10/14/2024 14:57,"If it feels like the GMC Sierra EV just hit the market, that's because, well, it did. GMC's entry into the electric truck wars debuted this summer as a 2024 model. But the 2025 version is already on its way, and it brings some enticing upgrades over ""last year's"" Sierra EV—and a cheaper price of admission to boot.
GMC today announced that the 2025 Sierra EV Denali will offer a base version with 390 miles of range, and a Max Range variant with up to 460 miles of range. Both figures are General Motors' estimates and not ones from the EPA, but those are coming soon, and there's little reason to doubt that the Sierra EV will be a range monster.
After all, the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 that I tested in Detroit just two months ago was GMC-estimated to max out at 440 miles of range. Including destination fees, that truck came in at $99,495, including destination fees.
Now, the base GMC Sierra EV Denali starts at $91,995, while the Max Range version starts at $100,495 (both including $2,095 destination fees.) Compared to the 2024 Edition 1, that's a small price to pay for an extra 20 miles of range, while the base model is a far more compelling proposition.
Little else seems to have changed from 2024. It's still a 200+ kWh (estimated) lithium-ion Ultium battery pack with fast charging speeds up to 350kW, offering up to 100 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes. The truck's max towing is rated at 10,500 pounds.
With this move, GM's electric truck lineup is looking a lot more fleshed out. Just last week, GM announced the Chevy Silverado EV—a downmarket version of the fancier Sierra EV—will start at $57,095. That truck's Extended Range LT model with 408 miles of range starts at $75,195. All told, the Silverado EV is now a much more promising option than the RST First Edition I tested earlier this year, which was an eyebrow-raising $96,000.
The GMC take on this same truck is much quieter and convincingly more premium overall. While a ""base"" price of $91,995 means it's no bargain-basement work truck, I do feel like you get a lot for the price here, from range to Super Cruise-capable towing and beyond.
And in even more exciting news, the GMC Sierra EV now comes in different colors besides the pictured Thunderstorm Gray (which is still my favorite):
Finally, more Sierra EV variants are coming in 2025, including the Elevation and AT4 models, which will offer ""even greater choice and rugged off-road capability,"" GMC officials said in a news release.

This Is An Alpine SUV Because Nothing Is Sacred Anymore,https://www.motor1.com/news/736958/alpine-a390-concept-debut/,"Et tu, Alpine?",12/25/2024 9:02,"Ah, just what we needed. Yet another SUV. I've always thought of Alpine as being the French equivalent of Lotus since they've focused on lightweight sports cars. Much like the peeps from Norfolk now have an electric SUV with the Eletre, the boys and girls based in Dieppe are introducing this–the A390_β. It's only a concept at this stage but a production version will follow next year.
Just like Ferrari is refusing to call the Purosangue an SUV, Alpine doesn't use the acronym. Instead, it's a ""sport fastback."" The sloping roofline gives the impression of an SUV that had an affair with a coupe. Because this is only a concept, the Renault-owned marque can get away with not giving the A390_β a conventional B-pillar. However, that won't be the case with the subsequent road-going model. In addition, the suicide doors won't make it to production either.
Although the concept does look more exciting than your typical SUV, logic tells us the actual vehicle people will be able to buy won’t match this level of pizzazz. There is hope, though. Alpine does promise the final car will retain around 85% of the exterior design but we'll believe it when we'll see it.
The futuristic interior is said to take after Formula 1 cars but obviously with a lot more seats. The A390 is touted as a five-seater version of the future electric A110 sports car. It's the one Alpine initially planned to develop with Lotus before the two parted ways in mid-2023.
Technical specifications are limited at this point but we do know the production model will feature three electric motors. One will sit at the front and the other two at the back, enabling all-wheel drive. It won’t be a permanent AWD setup, which suggests the front-mounted motor can be decoupled for a more tail-happy experience. Active torque vectoring is promised for a more engaging drive.
The A390 will be the second EV from Alpine, following the A290 hot hatchback. The latter is essentially a high-performance version of the reborn Renault 5. Although Alpine is coming to the United States in a couple of years, you won’t see these electric vehicles in North America. Instead, bigger SUVs are expected to get a US visa. There are also plans for an A310 coupe, a bigger four-seat sports car to take on the Porsche 911 but with an electric setup.
By the end of the decade, Alpine intends to have no fewer than seven EVs in its growing lineup. A supercar was recently confirmed and it'll either be entirely electric or will feature a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine.

2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron Packs Over 400 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/737215/audi-q6-sportback-etron-specs-official/,"Mind you, that’s on the WLTP cycle, but it’s still very impressive. There’s also a new SQ6 performance trim.",10/14/2024 3:34,"This is the all-new 2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron. It’s the coupe-like version of the more conventionally shaped Q6 E-Tron that debuted roughly seven months ago. It rides on the same PPE platform as the Porsche Macan, can recharge at up to 270 kilowatts from a compatible DC stall and has over 400 miles of range on the WLTP cycle.
Two battery sizes and two powertrain options are available. The smaller pack has a usable capacity of 75.8 kilowatt-hours (83 kWh gross), while the larger battery can store 94.9 kWh (100 kWh gross) of energy.
With rear-wheel drive and the entry-level battery pack, the new Q6 Sportback E-Tron has a WLTP-rated range of up to 338 miles on a full charge. Meanwhile, a dual-motor all-wheel drive model with the large pack can drive for up to 407 miles before needing a top-up. We expect these figures to go down once the EPA gets involved, but the coupe-ish EV will likely remain the range king among electric Audis even after the American rating is official.
More Audi EVs
By comparison, the Tesla Model Y, which is roughly 30,000 euros cheaper, offers between 282 and 373 miles of range on the WLTP cycle.
The efficiency improvement is partly due to the lower sloping roofline of the Sportback compared to the regular Q6 SUV. According to Audi, the whole roof arch was redesigned and the car now sits 1.4 inches lower than its more conventionally shaped sibling. This helped reduce the drag coefficient from 0.28 to 0.26, but it also reduced the cargo space in the trunk, albeit not by much. The rakish EV has 18 cubic feet of room for stuff in the rear, while the SUV has 18.6 cu ft. Fold the rear seats flat and the trunk capacity increases to 48.4 cu ft. There’s also a 2.2 cu ft front trunk, just like the Q6 E-Tron SUV.
Audi didn’t say how powerful the base, rear-driven version of the Q6 Sportback E-Tron is, but mentioned that it can accelerate from zero to 62 miles per hour in 7 seconds with Launch Control enabled. Next in line is the Q6 Sportback E-Tron Performance, which is still rear-wheel drive. It has 301 horsepower and can sprint to 62 mph in 6.6 seconds.
Adding a front motor results in a system output of 382 hp for the all-wheel drive Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron Quattro. With Launch Control turned on, this version can get to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.
Then, there’s the top-of-the-line SQ6, which has a dual-motor setup good for 482 hp and a 0-62 time of 4.3 seconds, while the range is rated at 377 miles. All versions are limited to 130 mph, except the SQ6 which can go up to 143 mph. All-wheel drive trims can tow up to 5,291 pounds, while rear-driven versions have a lower tow rating of 4,409 lbs in Europe.
When fitted with rear-wheel drive and the 75.8 kWh battery, the Q6 Sportback E-Tron can charge at up to 225 kW from a compatible DC stall, while RWD models with the 94.9 kWh can accept up to 260 kW.
Adding all-wheel drive ups the maximum charging rate to 270 kW, resulting in a 10-to-80% top-up in 22 minutes. Additionally, Audi claims the Q6 Sportback E-Tron Performance needs just 10 minutes at a fast charger to gain 165 miles of range.
Inside, the swoopy EV gets the same treatment as its SUV brother. This means there’s an 11.9-inch virtual cockpit display and a 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen running Android Automotive OS as standard. A third 10.9-inch passenger display is optional, as is an augmented-reality head-up display system
In Europe, the 2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron starts from 65,900 euros, while the top-spec SQ6 Sportback E-Tron starts at 96,200 euros. Production will be handled by Audi’s main factory in Ingolstadt, Germany, with order books slated to open at the turn of the year. Pricing and availability is yet to be determined for the North American market.",Iulian Dnistran
"Mini John Cooper Works Electric: It’s Official This Time, We Promise",https://insideevs.com/news/736986/mini-john-cooper-works-electric-debut-specs/,The first-ever battery-powered Mini JCW models are here. But you probably already knew that.,10/14/2024 2:10,"After what felt like an eternity filled with official pictures of camouflaged prototypes and preliminary technical specs, the cat is finally out of the bag–for real this time. This is the all-new Mini John Cooper Works Electric in all its glory. Though, seriously, Mini, you need to get your act together and stop teasing the hell out of your upcoming models and then expect people to act surprised when you drop the camo.
Aaaanyway. This is the real John Cooper Works, not the JCW trim you can get on the regular Mini hatchback, which is only a cosmetic pack. This means you get a healthy 258 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque from a front-mounted single electric motor. There’s also a boost function that offers an extra 27 hp at the push of a button for short bursts of acceleration.
The battery pack has a gross capacity of 54.2 kilowatt-hours and offers a combined WLTP-rated range of 230 miles. Under the more conservative EPA procedure, we expect the range rating to drop to around 200 miles on a full charge, but we’ll know for sure when Mini introduces the hot three-door hatchback in the United States.
More Mini
Going from zero to 62 miles per hour takes 5.9 seconds and the top speed is 124 miles per hour. The company didn’t say how fast the electric hot hatch can recharge, though. The Mini Cooper SE, which uses the same battery as the John Cooper Works, has a maximum DC charging rate of 95 kW, while the larger Countryman can accept up to 130 kW.
Mini said the new electric JCW hatchback has a specific suspension tune that maximizes the go-kart feeling Minis are known for, as well as ensuring agile handling.
Black side skirts, black C-pillar aero blades and a black rear spoiler are part of the standard kit, as well as JCW-specific 19-inch wheels. There's also a pretty aggressive front bumper. Inside, the go-fast electric Mini comes with a black and red pattern on the knitted surface of the dashboard, black faux-leather seats with multicolored knitted fabric and red accent stitching, as well as a high-resolution 9.4-inch round center touchscreen display that acts as both the infotainment screen and the digital instrument cluster.
The new Mini John Cooper Works Electric three-door hatchback will make its global debut at the Paris Motor Show this week, but we don’t know when–or if–it will make it to the United States. Next to it, Mini also showed the John Cooper Works Aceman, which is like a four-door crossover version of the hatchback. It has the same battery, power output and top speed as the three-dor hatchback, but the zero to 62 mph time is a little slower at 6.4 seconds and the WLTP range rating is also down to 220 miles on a full charge.",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Chevy Silverado EV Finally Starts At A Better Price: $57,095",https://insideevs.com/news/736426/chevy-silverado-ev-2025-range/,It also offers a truly staggering maximum range figure. But there's a catch to that lower price.,10/7/2024 12:06,"Chevrolet on Monday dropped details about the 2025 Silverado EV. The battery-powered version of General Motors' best-selling truck is getting a lower starting price and a new EPA range rating that puts it near the very top of the EV market.
The 2025 Silverado EV will start at $57,095, putting it within reach for a greater number of buyers. The new Max Range trim earns an EPA range estimate of 492 miles, beating out every other EV pickup truck on the market by a wide margin. Both the entry-level and range-topping trims are only available for commercial customers who buy various versions of the Silverado EV Work Truck, or WT.
“Truck customers tell us range is one of the main barriers to considering an EV. The 2024 Silverado EV already was the range leader, and for this new model year we’ve set the bar even higher,” Chevrolet Vice President Scott Bell said in a statement. “A second barrier to entry is price, so we are fortifying the Silverado EV lineup by providing more choice. For 2025, we’re introducing an LT trim, offering a more affordable RST package and expanding WT offerings. This increased capability and accessibility is great news for the segment, the industry, and the brand.”
Here's a full trim breakdown for the 2025 Silverado EV:
The new trims come during a pivotal time for GM's electric ambitions. After a rocky start of production and sales for its next-generation EVs—like the Chevy Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq—the automaker is rapidly gaining momentum. It appears to have put software glitches and battery-production bottlenecks behind it, and is now finally seeing success launching new electric models and scaling up their sales.
For 2024, the Silverado EV's inaugural model year, the truck was only available in two WT trims and the expensive, fully-loaded RST variant. Now, Chevy is filling in the gaps with some lower-priced options for both commercial and mainstream customers. With the new models, Chevy has a more well-rounded competitor to the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T.
Here are a few more details about the 2025 trims.
The all-new LT is priced so customers can qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, Chevy says. It supports 300-kilowatt fast charging, can tow 12,500 lb and has a payload capacity of 1,800 lb. Horsepower and torque are rated by GM at 645 and 765, respectively. Chevy's Multi-Flex Tailgate, which offers several different configurations, comes as standard equipment.
Upgrading to the Premium Package opens up options for Super Cruise—GM's wonderful hands-off highway-driving system—and the Multi-Flex Midgate. The latter lets you open up the divider between the cab and bed to haul longer items.
The 2025 Silverado EV WT now has a starting price that's essentially identical to Ford's electric work truck, the Lightning Pro. But the entry-level Silverado EV's range is still TBD.
Nearly 500 miles of range at the top end may sound like overkill—and that may in fact be the case for drivers who mostly go to the grocery store and back. But there's a good reason automakers like GM want to pack their pickup trucks with as much range as possible: Towing. The added weight and drag from towing something like a boat or a trailer can easily cut an EV's range in half. That makes the more typical 300 miles of estimated range a nonstarter for many truck lovers. Now, with a 500-mile pack, the Silverado EV should be able to tow for longer than ever before.

Caterham's Electric Sports Car Will Get Its Power From An Unlikely Source,https://www.motor1.com/news/735830/yamaha-power-caterham-sports-car/,The rear-wheel-drive electric coupe will fight the next Porsche Cayman.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Remember the Caterham Project V? The electric concept car debuted last year at the Goodwood Festival of Speed with an impressively low curb weight of 2,623 pounds. But it was more than just a one-and-done exercise; The niche British brand has real plans to launch a production model. And now we know who will power the electric coupe: Yamaha
The concept is now evolving into a prototype engineered by Japanese firm Tokyo R&D. It will be powered by a Yamaha electric powertrain, and should be completed by the middle of next year, with series production expected to commence at some point in 2026. Caterham doesn't go into details about Yamaha's electric motor, but the original Project V concept was rear-wheel drive with 268 horsepower on tap.
The show car from Goodwood had a 2+1 layout but an optional 2+2 configuration was mentioned. Caterham touted a 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and a top speed of 143 mph. The coupe's 55.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery had enough juice for 249 miles in the optimistic WLTP cycle. The concept supported DC charging at 150 kilowatts for a 20% to 80% charge in around 15 minutes.
Because concepts are typically diamonds in the rough, Caterham borrowed bits and pieces from other cars to speed up the Project V's development without compromising quality. Examples include Maserati seats and the Audi TT's door aperture. Some readily available parts will be installed in the road-going model to cut costs.
Even though it never built its own car, Yamaha is no stranger to the automotive industry. It teased us with a Miata rival in the mid-2010s that never went into production. Going further back, it helped Toyota develop the 2000GT in the 1960s before engineering and manufacturing Ford's V-6 SHO and V-8 SHO.
Perhaps the most well-known effort in the car world was Yamaha’s involvement in the Lexus LFA and its naturally aspirated V-10. The list goes on with a V-8 for Volvo as well as four-cylinder engines for the Toyota Celica, MR2, and the Lotus Elise. There was also the pint-sized Motiv concept and the aborted 1992 OX99-11 supercar that was supposed to go into production a couple of years later with a roaring V-12.
Yamaha hasn't completely abandoned ICE technology. Recent efforts have included a golf cart and a buggy modified to run on a hydrogen-burning combustion engine.

"The Chevy Blazer EV Gets Way Better For 2025: More Range, New Models",https://insideevs.com/news/735376/blazer-ev-2025-lineup/,"The long-awaited SS version goes on sale in Q1 2025, while other variants get improved range, horsepower and torque.",9/27/2024 11:12,"I'd say the Chevrolet Blazer EV has mounted a nice little comeback in 2024. It ended the previous year under a stop-sale order following software issues that InsideEVs was among the first to report on, only to see a big overhaul, sales wins and even a spot in our deputy editor's own personal garage. And today, General Motors officials say that things are due to get even better for the 2025 model year.
GM has announced pricing and availability of the 2025 Blazer EV family, including the deployment of a few long-promised variants with nice upgrades to range, pricing and horsepower for several others. Let's dig in.
We'll start with the fun news: The long-awaited Blazer EV SS is finally going on sale in Q1 of 2025. Pricing has been made official at $61,995, including destination. The performance Blazer EV will pack 595 horsepower—more than even the previously announced 557 hp—and can do zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds with the full-bore Wide Open Watts mode engaged. It should be a worthy competitor to the likes of the Kia EV6 GT, and I know someone will see how it squares up against the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N as well.
Next, GM says that 2025 brings all of the promised Blazer EV variants. Besides the SS, you can choose the all-wheel-drive, rear-wheel-drive and front-wheel-drive models too. The last one is all-new; the other two have been around for a bit. Offering all three drivetrain configurations makes the Blazer EV a pretty unique vehicle in the history of carmaking, but I'm curious how long the FWD version sticks around with the Equinox EV out there.
Additionally, the 2025 Blazer EV AWD has improved range, horsepower and torque from the 2024 model. The EPA-estimated range is now 283 miles, up from 279, and horsepower is bumped to 300 from 288. Torque is also boosted to 355 lb-ft from 333 lb-ft. It starts at $48,995.
The RWD version also gets a glow-up, going up to 334 miles of range from the 2024 model's 324 miles. Horsepower jumps to 365 hp versus the old car's 340 hp; torque stays the same. Pricing begins at $56,990.
The FWD Blazer EV remains a bit of an odd animal, but the pricing is respectable at $45,995. It gives you 220 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Range has not been finalized yet, according to GM.
The whole Blazer EV lineup fully qualifies for the $7,500 EV tax credits whether you buy or lease, so you are getting some solid bang for your buck here. And with these power and range bumps, I'd argue some needed distance between this car and the slightly smaller but still similarly priced Equinox EV.
Update: After getting a few questions about this, GM tells us that Super Cruise is optional on FWD and AWD LT and RS models but standard on the SS. It is not available on RWD models, but GM hasn't responded to additional questions as to why.
Is the Blazer EV a better deal than ever? Let us know what you think.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Gets Even Driftier,https://www.motor1.com/news/734891/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n/,A configurable Drift Mode and a handful of other upgrades join the lineup for 2025.,12/25/2024 9:02,"It’s been a little over a year since Hyundai took the wraps off the Ioniq 5 N. The high-performance electric crossover is entering the 2025 model year at home in South Korea with a surprisingly large number of changes. There aren't any styling tweaks since most of the work revolved around making the software better to deliver a more engaging drive.
The N Drift Optimizer that helps the Ioniq 5 N go sideways can now be configured by choosing from one of the 10 available levels of assistance. Dial it all the way up to level 10 (Pro mode) and the hot EV becomes tail-happy by minimizing the intervention of the stability control system so that drivers can ""drift more freely."" In addition, the system can now better detect suitable drift conditions, which Hyundai presumes will be only on a race track.
There's also something called Downshift Memory. Intended for track use, the function ""allows the vehicle to store commands without shifting and shift when the vehicle reaches the allowable engine revs (rpm) for downshifting."" We’ll remind you the old Kona N had a downshift memory logic system that prevented downshifting at high rpms.
Elsewhere, the artificial engine sound is automatically turned on when the launch control function is triggered. This N Active Sound+ simulates the noise of a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine as found in the Elantra N.
The 2025 Ioniq 5 N for Korea gets automatic high beams with glare-free functionality. There's also a Walk-Away Lock system that automatically locks the doors when the driver walks a certain distance away from the car. The model year change brings Vehicle to Load (V2L) so that you can use the battery's stored energy to power external devices.
Rounding off the list of novelties are the second-row safety windows and haptic warning for the steering wheel. The latter begins to vibrate to warn the driver whenever the assist systems detect a hazard.
In Korea, the 2025 Ioniq 5 N costs the equivalent of $57,600 after factoring in incentives. Meanwhile, Hyundai is putting the finishing touches on its sedan equivalent, the Ioniq 6 N.

Kia EVs Will Get Tesla Supercharger Access Early Next Year,https://insideevs.com/news/734928/kia-ev-tesla-supercharger-2025-adapter/,Some Kia EV6 and EV9 buyers will get a free adapter. Others will have to pay for it.,9/24/2024 7:53,"Kia electric vehicles sold in the United States will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network on January 15, 2025, the company said in a statement released today. The South Korean automaker will follow in the footsteps of Ford, Rivian and General Motors by striking a deal with Tesla to use its expansive DC fast-charging network that has over 16,500 stalls in the U.S.
Customers who took delivery of a new 2024 or 2025 Kia EV9 or 2024 Kia EV6 from September 6 will get a free adapter that will allow them to use the Supercharger network. Deliveries for the complimentary adapter are slated to start in early 2025.
However, people who bought an EV6, EV9 or Niro EV before the aforementioned date will have to pay for an adapter, although Kia didn’t say how much it would cost. For reference, the Tesla-made NACS to CCS1 adapter sold by General Motors costs $225, while third-party adapters are slightly less expensive.
More Stuff Like This
Kia will offer three adapters: one that allows current Kia EVs to fast-charge on Tesla Superchargers, one that allows future Kia EVs equipped from the factory with the Tesla plug to charge at CCS1 stalls like those offered by Electrify America and EVgo, and one that allows NACS-equipped Kia EVs to AC-charge on non-Tesla Level 2 chargers. In other words, there will be NACS to CCS1, CCS1 to NACS and J1772 to NACS adapters available from Kia starting next year.
As a reminder, current Kia electric vehicles come from the factory with the Combined Charging System 1 (CCS1) plug, while Tesla’s Supercharger network uses the so-called North American Charging Standard (NACS), except for the few stalls that are equipped with a built-in adapter known as the Magic Dock.
The refreshed EV6 is slated to become the first Kia EV sold in the U.S. with a native NACS charging port. The European-spec 2025 EV6 shown here has a CCS2 port.
If you’re wondering why Kia mentions NACS-equipped EVs, it’s because it will start making them pretty soon. As with the recently revealed 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 that comes with a NACS plug, the upcoming Kia EV6 will ditch the CCS1 connector in favor of the more compact plug designed by Tesla, at least in North America. Other models, like the EV9 will follow suit.
When Kia EVs gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network next year, customers will be able to pay for top-ups using the Kia Access app but only after a vehicle software update has been performed. There will be no need for the Tesla app.",Iulian Dnistran
The Ford Ranger PHEV Seems Like The Electrified Truck You Actually Want (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/733923/ford-ranger-phev-specs-range-towing/,It has heaps of torque and two electric outlets in the bed that can output up to 6.9 kilowatts of power for tools and appliances.,9/18/2024 10:10,"UPDATE: In an e-mail to our friends over at Motor1, Ford Truck Communications Manager Dawn McKenzie said the Ranger PHEV is not coming to the U.S.:
""The all-new Ford Ranger PHEV is only available for select global markets outside of North America. For customers in North America looking for a hybrid or electric truck, we currently offer Maverick Hybrid, F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid and F-150 Lightning.""
Ford is putting its money where its mouth is. After canceling an upcoming all-electric three-row SUV and pledging to bring more hybrid and plug-in hybrid models to the market, the American automaker has revealed the Ranger PHEV mid-size pickup in Germany today.
Bigger than the American-spec Maverick hybrid compact pickup, the Ranger with a plug is powered by a 2.3-liter gasoline engine that sends power to all four wheels through a 10-speed modular automatic transmission and a two-speed transfer case. There’s also a lockable rear differential on offer for those tricky trips off the beaten track.
That 10-speed auto houses a 75-kilowatt (100-horsepower) electric motor that can work either on its own or together with the combustion engine to provide a total system output of 279 hp and 509 pound-feet of torque–more than the Ranger Raptor’s standard 430 lb-ft. And because the e-motor is inside the transmission, drivers can use four-wheel drive even when the 2.3-liter lump under the hood is turned off. There’s also regenerative braking.
More Electrified Pickups
Power for the electric motor comes from an 11.8-kWh (usable) battery pack that’s nestled between specially engineered frame rails. The battery offers a WLTP range of over 28 miles and charging it from empty to full takes less than four hours, according to Ford, although the automaker didn’t mention how potent the on-board charger is.
Four EV-related driving modes are available, including Auto EV, EV Now, EV Later and EV Charge. Similar to the hybrid and all-electric F-150, the Ranger PHEV comes as standard with a 2.3 kW electrical outlet in the bed which can be used to power tools or appliances, but Ford also offers an upgraded package with two 15-amp outlets in the back delivering a combined maximum power of 6.9 kW–3.45 kW for each outlet.
With revised suspension compared to its conventionally powered sibling, the plug-in Ranger can carry a payload of up to 2,205 lbs and can tow up to 7,716 lbs. The smaller Maverick can only tow up to 4,000 lbs, while the maximum payload is 1,500 lbs, so the Ranger PHEV makes a lot more sense if you’re looking for a more capable machine that can also run on electricity alone.
The new Ford Ranger PHEV will be available in Europe starting in the spring of 2025 in Wildtrak and XLT trim levels. A PHEV-exclusive Stormtrak launch edition is also in the works with all sorts of goodies as standard, including 18-inch wheels, fender vents, matrix LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system and a 10-speaker B&O sound system.
The Europe-bound plug-in Ranger will be built in Silverton, South Africa.",Iulian Dnistran
2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV: You Can Order One Now,https://insideevs.com/news/734185/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-orders/,The first electric muscle car is coming soon. Dodge opened up orders and launched a new online configurator.,9/17/2024 16:10,"If you've been waiting for an electric vehicle that looks—and, importantly, sounds—like a good ol' American muscle car, then you're in luck. Dodge on Monday opened up orders for the 2024 Charger Daytona, which is the brand's debut EV and the world's first electric muscle car.
Well, it's the first muscle EV you can buy brand-new from the manufacturer; people have been retrofitting electric motors into vintage Ford Mustangs and the like for years.
Dodge launched a new online configurator on Monday that lets you spec your Charger Daytona to your liking. It even lets customers open the rear hatch, inspect the frunk, open the doors and see what the interior looks like with the rear seats folded down, which is all pretty neat. However, customers will need to contact a Dodge dealer to place a custom order or buy a preconfigured Charger.
The 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona online configurator
The Charger Daytona will eventually come in both two-door and four-door options and with the option of an electric or (eventually) a gasoline powertrain. It debuts in two-door EV guise with the sedan and inline-six engine coming later. Early customers can choose from two models: the Charger R/T and the Charger Scat Pack.
The R/T costs $61,590 (including a destination fee, but excluding options and dealer markups) and delivers a Dodge-estimated 496 horsepower. The Scat Pack will run you $75,185 (same caveats apply) and boasts a whopping 670 horsepower. That one should hit 60 mph from a standstill in 3.3 seconds, Dodge says. The R/T is EPA-rated for a respectable 317 miles of range, while the Scat Pack serves up 260 miles.
The cars also come with Dodge's ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" a feature that blasts synthetic rumbles to the outside world. Dodge wants its first EV to appeal to its existing customers—a macho crowd with a need for speed it calls ""The Brotherhood of Muscle""—so it's making sure the Charger Daytona is as loud, powerful and over the top as its gas-fueled models. We'll have to see whether Dodge can win over the V8-loving EV skeptics.
To that end, Dodge is lavishing perks on the Charger EV's earliest customers. People who place a custom order before November will get a two-day performance-driving course, a ""VIP concierge"" to answer their questions and a pair of leather, Dodge-branded driving gloves. All 2024 Charger Daytona buyers will be able to choose between $600 in public-charging credits and an at-home Level 2 charger.
Would that entice you to take the plunge into a Charger Daytona? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Volvo’s Car Subscription Program Is Dead,https://insideevs.com/news/733597/volvo-car-subscription-over/,"Care by Volvo brought in new customers for the automaker, but now it’s all about “operational efficiencies.”",9/13/2024 2:34,"Volvo has suspended its subscription program in the United States and Europe “for the foreseeable future,” the company told Automotive News yesterday. Dubbed Care by Volvo, the vehicle subscription service ended on August 1, but people who are still enrolled can finish their term and then become eligible for a $1,000 credit toward a new Volvo purchase or $500 toward a lease.
""This allows for concentrated focus on our core customer offers and the coming introduction of new products, [and an] increase in operational efficiencies,"" company spokesperson Russell Datz said. In other words, it’s all about cost-cutting.
Care by Volvo was first rolled out in 2017, but some dealers heavily criticized it and then a six-month investigation by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles concluded that the Swedish automaker had failed to properly notify dealers about related changes to the franchise agreement and provided preferential treatment in allocating subscription vehicles to certain stores.
More Volvo Stuff
So Volvo started over in 2019, and by 2020, the program was profitable, according to Automotive News. The idea behind the vehicle subscription service was to provide more flexibility than a conventional lease at slightly lower monthly prices. After the latest update to the program terms, customers could choose a car that was in stock and then swap it for another one or terminate the contract altogether after five months without penalty.
The monthly fee included the car, insurance, roadside assistance and other perks, essentially making the ownership experience hassle-free. Prices started at around $600 for a combustion-powered Volvo XC40 and only went uphill from there.
The program helped Volvo reel in people who wouldn’t have otherwise considered a car from the Swedish brand, with 80% of customers new to the marque, according to data from previous years. Dealers got a cut of the subscription revenue and could then list lower-mileage, higher-margin certified models for sale after the terms ended.
The automaker didn’t disclose how many people signed up for Care by Volvo.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis Invests $406M In U.S. Plants To Build BEVs Alongside ICE Models,https://www.motor1.com/news/733390/stellantis-investment-factories-bev/,"The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will be its first US factory to build a fully electric vehicle, the Ram 1500 REV.",12/25/2024 9:02,"On Wednesday, Stellantis announced it is investing $406 million into three Michigan factories. The money will go toward preparing the facilities to produce battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and their associated components, and the automaker plans to build BEVs alongside their combustion-powered counterparts as it navigates a changing automotive industry and faces questions about its future in the United States.
The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant is getting the bulk of the investment—$235.5 million—which will allow the facility to produce the electric Ram 1500 Rev and the range-extended 1500 Ramcharger. It’ll be the company’s first US plant to build a fully electric vehicle. (The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona will be built in Brampton, Ontario, just outside Toronto.) The company has installed a new conveyor system, new automation processes for BEVs, and retooling to allow it to build gas- and battery-powered pickups on the same line.
Nearly $100 million will go to preparing the Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce the electric Jeep Wagoneer. Stellantis will have the ability to assemble the electric vehicle on the same line as the combustion-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models, which should allow it to tweak production to better build the types of vehicles customers want.
Flexibility is something that Dodge CEO Matt McAlear talked about last month regarding the new Charger Daytona, which rides in the STLA Large platform that Stellantis is investing in. The Dodge will spawn BEV and combustion-powered models.
The smallest investment, $73 million, will go to improve the automaker’s Dundee Engine Plant. The money will help retool the factory to build battery trays for the STLA Frame platform later this year and front and rear beams for the STLA Large architecture in 2026. Stellantis will build those components alongside two new combustion engines, including a new 1.6-liter inline-four that the company could use for future hybrid-electric vehicles.
The future is unclear, especially for automakers. People must make vital decisions years before a product goes on sale. Stellantis has 14 brands under its control after the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles merged in 2021, and the company’s plan to give every one of them a decade to prove their worth remains in place even as sales decline and the lineup thins in the US. But it takes time to chart a new course, and we will see new products from Stellantis soon.

It's Official: Nissan Is Working on a New Silvia Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/732599/new-nissan-silvia-development-starts/,"Work has started on a third sports car, but a production version has still yet to be approved.",12/25/2024 9:02,"It’s been over a decade since Nissan introduced the retro-flavored IDx concept, hinting at a third sports car alongside the 370Z and GT-R. The former 370Z was replaced by the new Z, and the GT-R is dead—at least for the time being. The IDx, meanwhile, would've been too costly to produce and there wasn't enough demand. Nissan was also concerned it would've cannibalized sales of the 370Z.
However, Nissan has been dropping hints lately about launching a third performance model. The company has gone on record several times about resurrecting the beloved Silvia nameplate. But now it's official: The Silvia is coming back.
In a new interview with Australia's Drive magazine, a high-ranked official confirmed the sports car is officially in the works. Nissan Vice-President Global Product Strategy Ivan Espinosa shared the good news: ""We've been doing some very early upstream exercises of what the architecture could look like.""
An ""upstream exercise"" is a business process that basically refers to initial planning and the early stages of development. Espinosa aims for Nissan to have the sports car ready before the end of the decade with an electrified powertrain. That may be bad news for purists but a gas-only setup wouldn't work globally, especially in Europe where there are stringent emissions regulations that keep getting stricter.
Nissan wants the reborn Silvia to comply with regulations in as many countries as possible so it can ramp up production to achieve economies of scale. Even though sports cars are a niche market and developing one from scratch is a costly endeavor, Nissan won't join forces with another automaker to make it happen. Rather than going down the Z4/Supra, GR86/BRZ, or Miata/124 Spider route, the new Silvia will be an all-Nissan effort.
Espinosa is confident the company can ride solo in the engineering process but admits the project necessitates ""a serious level of investment,"" which is a ""difficult"" commitment to make. A new Silvia would be developed from the ground up, and his wish is for Nissan to skip a collaboration with another brand.
""I'm trying, as I said and I keep saying it in my brain, three sports cars in my lineup, a GT-R, a Z, and something else. And this something else in my brain is called the Silvia. Now, will we do it? I'm trying. I'm not sure we're going do it, just to be 100% clear, but It's something that I would like to do if we, if we can. I'm trying to make it work, I'm trying to make it happen. It's not an easy case. it's not easy because the sports cars market is shrinking.""
The fact of the matter is sports cars don't sell all that well. Nissan took its sweet time replacing the 370Z with a Z, and that's not even an all-new vehicle. It's understandable why the company is reluctant to pour a lot of money in what would ultimately be a niche product when it already has one (Z) and is working on another (GT-R). The mighty Godzilla going on a multi-year hiatus goes to show why Nissan is not rushing to replace the R35 anytime soon.
Launching a third sports car adds another level of complexity during challenging times for Nissan given the need to electrify its lineup. We can only hope that it makes the cut considering the Silvia's cult following and the scarcity of affordable sports cars. Honda's reborn Prelude gives us hope this segment of the market can survive in an SUV-hungry world.

BMW Will Launch A Hydrogen Car In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/732646/2028-bmw-hydrogen-car-confirmed/,It's teaming up with Toyota to make it happen.,12/25/2024 9:02,"A new player is about to enter the hydrogen game as BMW has confirmed plans to roll out a fuel cell electric vehicle in 2028. To bring the project to fruition, it's expanding its existing collaboration with Toyota, one of the few other automakers that still believes hydrogen has a future. While the Japanese brand has been selling the Mirai for a decade, this will be BMW's first hydrogen car people will actually be able to buy.
Since the vehicle won't be launching for another four years, BMW refrains from going into details. However, it does say the hydrogen model will be a version of an existing product. Munich’s latest hydrogen project is based on the X5. That being said, logic tells us a hydrogen SUV would not be a production version of the iX5 pictured here. This generation of the luxobarge is already in the second half of its life cycle. By 2028, it will have been replaced by the next-gen vehicle.
Whichever shape it'll take, BMW pledges to sell an original product that'll stay true to the brand instead of being a reskinned Toyota. Naturally, the latter is working on its own cars that will utilize the hydrogen fuel cell tech it's developing with its Bavarian partner. In the meantime, it's worth noting the fuel cells that go into the iX5 Hydrogen are supplied by Toyota.
The zero-emission SUV is part of a test fleet of fewer than 100 units built in Spartanburg and modified at a pilot plant in Munich. It's where the 396-horsepower iX5 gets its pair of 700-bar hydrogen tanks made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The two hold six kilograms of hydrogen for a WLTP range of 313 miles. It takes three to four minutes to refuel the vehicle, so about the same as a gas or diesel X5.
Provided BMW's first hydrogen car will be based on the next-generation X5, it'll be underpinned by the same CLAR platform as the gas/diesel/plug-in hybrid versions. There are reports that BMW might also launch a conventional EV with batteries on the same architecture as the rest of the X5 flavors. The next X5 is supposedly going into production in the latter half of 2026 and should include BEV versions from day one.
Arriving next year, Neue Klasse will be BMW’s first dedicated electric architecture and is being developed with a hydrogen fuel cell setup in mind. However, reports indicate that CLAR will be used instead, at least for the initial hydrogen efforts.
This might come as a surprise, but BMW has been actively involved in the development of hydrogen cars since 1979. It all started with the 520h featuring a combustion engine modified to run on hydrogen, a formula that was repeated later with the V-12-powered E38 and E65 sedans during the 2000s. That said, work on hydrogen ICEs was abandoned many years ago as the engineers preferred to focus on fuel cells after realizing they're more efficient.
Speaking with GoAuto earlier this year, Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group, said:
""Basically, with the X5 Hydrogen FCEV we get around 500 km [310 miles] from a fill. If I put a combustion engine in the same car with the same tank, I wouldn't even get 300 km [186 miles]. That is the difference between a product we can sell, and a product we cannot sell. At the 500-km [310-mile] mark, and with a refueling time of three to four minutes, I think people will consider making the move to hydrogen – so, it is relevant.""
There is a major problem we'd like to highlight. Yes, the refueling infrastructure. It’s basically nonexistent in many parts of the world, so we won’t be surprised if the vehicle will only be sold in select regions where owners can juice up their hydrogen cars. 2028 is four years away and the network might improve by then. BMW and Toyota do say they’re ""seeking regional or local projects to further drive the development of hydrogen infrastructure through collaborative initiatives.""

The Renault R17 Electric Restomod Is A Gorgeous Reinterpretation Of A 1970s Classic,https://insideevs.com/news/732636/renault-r17-electric-restomod/,"It’s wider, more powerful and has a tastefully recreated digital dash. Oh, and it’s also electric.",9/5/2024 4:26,"French carmaker Renault has transformed the 1970s two-door coupe known as the 17 into a modern, battery-powered restomod sporting retro looks, a brown paint job and a clever integration of screens where the traditional gauge cluster used to be.
It’s called the R17 electric restomod and it was created in collaboration with avant-garde French designer Ora Ito as the latest in a series of partnerships between the automaker and contemporary artists to put a modern touch on some of its most recognizable models.
Compared to the original Renault 17 that was sold in the United States on and off until its demise in 1979, the electric restomod is about seven inches wider, has slightly more flared wheel arches and the front and rear lights are LEDs mimicking the design of the first iteration of the 17 which had double round headlights.
More Beautiful EVs
The wheels are wider and taller than before and there’s a slight nod to the original car’s C-pillar louvers.
“I wanted to drape the Renault 17 in a second skin, showcasing the design while giving it a more contemporary look in terms of flow, dynamics and rationality through my own approach to design and my own signature: simplexity,” Ito said. “I wanted to simplify the more complex aspects.”
Under the hood of the old coupe was a 1.6-liter gasoline engine that drove the front wheels. The restomod ditched the entire setup for an all-electric approach with a rear-mounted motor that’s good for 270 horsepower. Renault didn’t say how big the battery is, but the range is estimated to be 249 miles on a full charge.
Inside, there are four individual displays sitting behind the square-ish two-spoke steering wheel mimicking the analog layout of the original car. There’s also a central infotainment screen located on the center console, just below the dash, where the clock used to sit.
It’s a wonderful design that’s very similar to the supposedly production-intent Hyundai N Vision 74 hydrogen car. But while Hyundai has voiced its intention to put the retro-looking coupe into production, the Renault R17 electric restomod will remain a one-off affair.",Iulian Dnistran
"Volvo Admits Defeat, Won't Go Fully Electric by 2030",https://www.motor1.com/news/732504/volvo-backtracks-ev-goal-2030/,New target: plug-in hybrids and EVs should account for 90-100% of sales.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Volvo was one of the first automakers to promise an electric-only lineup. If you recall, the original announcement was made in March 2021. At the end of May 2024, Volvo's CEO said an EV-only portfolio is still ""very achievable."" At that point, Jim Rowan was ""confident"" Volvo could end sales of vehicles with combustion engines in just five years.
However, during the most recent quarterly investor webcast held in late July, the automaker's CEO admitted that it'll ""take time to bridge different parts of the world for full electrification."" In other words, the initial goal to become a pure EV brand by 2030 might not be achieved. Fast forward to early September, Volvo is now officially readjusting its lofty electric goals.
The new target is for plug-in hybrids and electric cars to account for 90-100% of annual sales by the end of the decade. Volvo concedes cars without charging ports are likely to stick around longer than initially estimated, but only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models.""
The Swedish marque believes several factors have contributed to the slower-than-projected adoption of EVs. The development of the charging infrastructure is progressing at a slower pace. In addition, some countries have either reduced or completely eliminated incentives for EVs. Volvo also blames newly applied tariffs on electric cars in certain markets.
Volvo hopes cars with a charging cord (PHEVs+EVs) will account for 50-60% of deliveries by 2025, up from 48% during the second quarter of this year. From April through June, fully electric cars accounted for 26% of total shipments. The company's plan is to continue investments in mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid models as part of its ""strategic adjustments"" to better reflect what people want.
In the long run, Volvo still wants to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Volvo is the latest in a long string of automakers to backtrack from its original electric goals. In recent months, we've seen the likes of Porsche, Mercedes, Bentley, and Ford of Europe push back their aggressive electric agendas.

"2025 Volvo XC90 PHEV Has Sharper Looks, New Tech",https://insideevs.com/news/732476/2025-volvo-xc90-phev-looks-sharper-new-tech/,"Despite having a range of new models in the pipeline, Volvo still relies heavily on the XC90 to drive sales.",9/4/2024 9:15,"Volvo is doing pretty well globally. In the first seven months of 2024, its sales worldwide were up 13% compared to the same period last year. The surge is driven by its electrified lineup, whose sales are up 30%.
However, in the U.S., Volvo’s momentum has stalled. The EX30 is delayed until 2025 and the EX90 that InsideEVs recently reviewed isn’t fully polished. That means the brand must rely on its best-selling car stateside, the XC90 SUV, to do the heavy lifting before its next-generation models are fully ready to roll.
The Swedish automaker is calling the updated XC90 a ""2025.5"" model year car, which basically means it has some overlap with the current model on sale, but also offers some new stuff.
The obvious visual distinction is the updated exterior, which is more chiseled and cohesive than before. The grille is smoothly integrated with the body and new headlamps and taillamps look sleek. Inside, it gets a new central display with upgraded user interface and under the skin there are some improvements to the chassis.
To recap, the powertrains remain the same. It will be offered with the all-wheel-drive B5 and B6 trims powered by mild hybrid four-cylinder engines. The T8 plug-in hybrid will continue to get the four-cylinder turbocharged engine paired to a rear-axle mounted electric motor.
The e-motor draws power from the same 18.8 kilowatt-hour (14.7 kWh usable) battery pack that delivers an EPA estimated 32 miles of range on a single charge. Combined output is a rather healthy 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque.
On the exterior, the air intake, front bumper, hood and front fenders are all subtly redesigned to make the XC90 look more in line with the all-electric EX90. Gone are the old headlamps and in come a new set of T-shaped Matrix LED lamps. The taillamps also have a new LED signature. Volvo will offer new 20-, 21- and 22-inch wheels.
Volvos already get a built-in Google system but now there’s an upgraded layout meant to be more user-friendly. Volvo said the most common apps on the central screen will now appear on the home page, on what it calls a “contextual bar.” That means fewer taps to open what you want. It’s all similar to what you get on the brand new EX90.
Gone is the old dashboard integrated screen and in comes a new and larger 11.2 inch free standing central display. For the tech nerds: pixel density is up by 21%, meaning it's crisper than before. But even if your older Volvo doesn’t have this new and fancy screen, you will still get the upgraded user interface through an over-the-air update if your car was manufactured in 2020 or later.
There are also some other small tweaks, like improved sound insulation and more storage spaces inside. There’s an additional cup holder and the wireless charging pad is now positioned behind the central tunnel. Volvo said it made these changes based on owner feedback.
On the chassis side of things, the XC90 now gets Frequency Selective Damping. When you’re driving at slower speeds, these dampers basically make the suspension softer, making the ride smoother over bumps and undulations. But when you give it the beans, the dampers mechanically stiffen up for better control and stability.
It will go on sale later this year in the U.S. in six and seven seat configurations at a starting price of $58,450, plus destination fee of $1,295. That’s roughly $2,000 more than the starting price of the current model. Customer deliveries start in the first quarter of 2025.
In a roundtable with reporters at Volvo's headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden, CEO Jim Rowan said the company had to ""pivot"" because of the withdrawal of subsidies in certain markets and the new tariffs imposed by the U.S. and Europe on cars made in China. But despite that Volvo is still committed to electrification, even if that's now delayed.
""I still believe in electrification. I'm an engineer. Electrification is a much better propulsion system than petrol,"" he said. ""Internal combustion engines are probably 35% efficient, electric systems are 91-92% when it comes to efficiency. So at the end of the day technology will win. Electric is the technology of the future but it will just take a little bit longer than everybody first thought.""
If you want the latest and greatest Volvo, the fully-electric EX90 might be something to consider. But as InsideEVs found during the first drive review recently, that EV isn’t fully cooked yet, especially in the software department. CarPlay doesn’t work yet and Volvo’s new-gen driver assistance features are still under development.
We haven't tested the updated XC90 on the road yet, but once we do, we’ll share our thoughts. For now, if you're after a large, family-friendly, electrified Volvo, the XC90 might still be your best bet.

Smart Grows Up With New Midsize Electric Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/731675/smart-midsize-electric-crossover-unveiled/,"At 185 inches long, the Smart #5 has a very similar footprint to a Tesla Model Y.",8/28/2024 16:00,"Smart is distancing itself even further from its roots with the unveiling of the #5 electric crossover, the biggest model to ever wear a Smart badge. It is the third new smart to be unveiled after the #1 and #3, and purely based on its size alone, it has its sights set on the Tesla Model Y.
Measuring exactly 185 inches in total length, it has an almost identical footprint to Tesla’s global best-seller. It’s entering a segment populated by other talented electric crossovers from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Ford and others, so it needs to be special to stand out and win buyers.
We already had a pretty good idea of what the #5 was going to look like after Smart unveiled the #5 Concept, which had the production #5 body but with raised suspension and a general off-road makeover. It looks quite upright from most angles, with a more traditional SUV profile not too dissimilar from that of the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz EQB.
It’s being pitched as an electric family crossover for outdoor enthusiasts, and it has an available Adventurers’ Collection pack that adds a roof light bar, underbody protection, a roof carrier, side steps and a ladder on the side. With this pack selected, it really does look ready to take you off the beaten path, even though it doesn’t have any extra ground clearance or mechanical changes to enhance its off-road ability.
Smart wants to highlight the #5’s interior, which is not only roomy but also packed with tech. It has 34 storage compartments in total, including a 2.5 cubic-foot front trunk and up to 54 cubic feet of space inside the vehicle if you fold the rear seats. What steals the show inside the vehicle is the huge 25.6-inch augmented reality head-up display, which complements a 10.3-inch digital gauge cluster and two high-resolution 13-inch AMOLED displays, one of which is in front of the passenger.
The infotainment animations are built using Unreal Engine, so for everything to run smoothly on all those screens, it needs a lot of processing power. That comes courtesy of an AMD V2000 eight-core integrated CPU and GPU designed for both mini PCs and automotive use.
Thanks to its 800-volt platform, the Smart #5 can quickly charge its 100-kilowatt-hour battery from 10 to 80% in 15 minutes. This gives an impressive range of 460 miles, but that’s on the optimistic Chinese CLTC test cycle. Its real-world range will probably be closer to 300-320 miles.
CarNewsChina reports that while the powertrain details are still unknown, the base versions will feature a single motor driving the rear wheels, producing 335 or 358 horsepower, and a dual-motor all-wheel drive version with 579 horsepower. The top model will have Brabus badges and increase the combined output of the dual-motor setup to 638 hp.
All #5s will be built in China, and they will go on sale there first, but Smart plans to begin sales in Europe in 2025. However, with looming increased import duties imposed on cars manufactured in China, the #5 may end up being quite expensive, and European buyers may want to stick to more keenly priced locally manufactured vehicles.

The Electric Porsche Panamera Won't Kill The Gas Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/731426/porsche-electric-panamera-confirmed/,The two will peacefully coexist for many years.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Porsche is playing its cards right with the Cayenne by keeping the gas versions on sale even after the next-generation electric model arrives later this decade. The ICE car will be offered well into the 2030s. Porsche will follow a similar strategy for the Panamera.
Launched earlier this year, the third-generation Panamera has a long shelf life ahead of it. Speaking with Autocar, Porsche's research and development boss confirmed plans for an all-electric Panamera. Michael Steiner told the British magazine the model's duality will echo that of the SUV: ""The new Cayenne is fully electric, but for its whole lifespan we will have the ICE version in parallel. It's the same for the Panamera.""
Considering the electric Panamera launch date hasn't even been announced, and the ICE model will be available during the EV's life cycle, the gas car will likely remain on sale into the next decade. But where will the Panamera without a combustion engine fit in Porsche's lineup? Based on a previous statement made by CEO Oliver Blume, the car could slot above the Taycan: ""I think it could work [having both EVs] because they are playing in different segments. The Panamera is one step higher than the Taycan.""
Porsche has already applied this ICE+EV strategy with the gas and electric Macan models. Well, kind of. The conventionally powered crossover dies in 2026. Meanwhile, it has already been discontinued in Europe because it no longer complies with a stricter cybersecurity law that came into effect earlier this year.
For the same reason, the 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman are no longer for sale in the EU. The sports car duo remains available in other markets but it too will be retired at some point in 2025 to make way for electric replacements.
Porsche still hopes it will reach its target of having EVs account for 80% of sales by 2030 and is renewing the products to pave the way. The large three-row SUV coming later this decade will be exclusively electric. However, the Zuffenhausen-based company is a bit more cautious in terms of EV adoption now that it has realized ""this transition will happen slower in a lot of markets,"" according to Steiner.
He also believes synthetic fuel could help during this gradual switch from ICE to EV by blending e-fuels with gas: ""By the end of the decade, there could be a significant share of e-fuel in use. We could, little by little, gallon by gallon, substitute fossil fuel with e-fuel by mixing a blend.""
Since December 2022, Porsche has been producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile. As a refresher, the combustion engine is expected to get a new lease on life in the EU as sales of new ICE cars could continue after 2035 as long as they're powered by carbon-neutral fuel. However, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse is worried the legislation surrounding the use of synthetic fuels could turn out to be a ""bogus solution:""
""There are currently many indications that the EU Commission is striving for a bogus solution in which the ban on combustion engines is relaxed simply by ostensibly opening up to e-fuels. However, if it then does nothing to accelerate the ramp-up of low-CO2 fuels and make their use practicable, this would be a deliberate ban on combustion engines through the back door.""
Whatever the case may be, Porsche is not abandoning the development of combustion engines. Steiner said investments will continue to be made in the V-6 and V-8 to comply with tougher emissions regulations.

"Volkswagen ID. Buzz Starts At $59,995 In America, Gets So-So Range",https://insideevs.com/news/730811/vw-id-buzz-price-range/,"It's taken years, but the electric rebirth of Volkswagen's iconic Microbus is coming to America. Was it worth the wait?",8/21/2024 8:00,"The bus is back.
Though it's been on sale in its native Europe since summer 2022, and made its concept debut way back in 2017, the electric Volkswagen ID. Buzz is finally headed to the U.S. later this year. And when it arrives, it's not only going to be the long wheelbase version of the van, but also a pretty feature-loaded electric people-hauler.
But all that style comes at a price. The ID. Buzz will start at $59,995, excluding destination fees, with an EPA-estimated electric range of 234 miles for rear-wheel-drive models and 231 miles for all-wheel-drive models. All cars pack a 91-kWh battery.
That, unfortunately, is quite a bit less than the approximately 260 miles of range that many of us had anticipated. And it's both a far cry from the generally excellent range the Volkswagen ID.4 crossover puts out these days, and the three-row Kia EV9, where most trims get between 270 and 304 miles of EPA-rated range.
Then again, I'm not entirely convinced the ID. Buzz and EV9 are direct competitors—or that the ID. Buzz has any direct competitors. There's kind of nothing else like this on U.S. roads, and if you want one (and can afford one) then you're probably gonna go for it. And you'll turn a lot of heads everywhere you go.
Volkswagen officials said the ID. Buzz will come in three trims as a 2025 model when it arrives on dealer lots toward the end of this year: the base Pro S starting at $59,995, Pro S Plus at $63,495, and the launch-only 1st Edition at $65,495. The van also gets some North America-exclusive interior color options.
Here's how the various trims break down:
As we have reported previously, there is no seven-seat and AWD combination for the U.S.-spec ID. Buzz, so configurations work thusly:

A Cheaper Tesla Model 3 Has Arrived. But It's Not What You Think,https://insideevs.com/news/730514/tesla-model-3-mexico-interior/,Tesla has been promising more affordable models for a while. But this de-contented Model 3 from Mexico may not be what you had in mind.,8/17/2024 15:16,"The world is waiting for more affordable electric cars, but the world's top electric automaker (depending on how China's BYD is doing in any given quarter) hasn't quite delivered on that front. While lower-priced new competitors from General Motors, Kia, Stellantis, Ford and more are right around the corner, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has only vaguely committed to cheaper models amid its newfound focus on AI and autonomous driving technology.
Still, during a July earnings call, Musk reaffirmed that 2025 will bring new EVs that ""utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.”
So when we look at this new Model 3 variant that just dropped in Mexico, we have to wonder: is this what he meant? Or is it just a cheaper entryway into the Tesla brand for a burgeoning EV market?
Tesla Model 3 Cloth Interior
Regardless, meet the cheapest Model 3 that Mexico has ever seen. As spotted by Not A Tesla App, this Model 3 variant drops the vegan leather for cloth seats (I believe for the first time on a Tesla), no rear-facing screen, white-only ambient interior lighting and no options for heated seats or steering wheels. In doing so, it ditches a few updates from the new ""Highland"" Model 3 that debuted last year.
It's perhaps the most de-contented Tesla ever, more akin to a Toyota Corolla than any sort of premium or luxury car; while it's long been debatable whether the Model 3 even falls into that category, this one assuredly does not.
But is that such a bad thing? I'd argue not at all; in fact, this feels like one of the most basic, bare-bones EVs currently around, and you still get 438 km (about 272 miles) of electric range and a zero to 100 km/h (60 mph) time of just over six seconds.
Best of all, it is indeed cheaper. This rear-wheel-drive Model 3—which does not have a specific name—can be ordered for 749,000 pesos, or about $40,000 in the U.S. at current exchange rates. It's also 50,000 pesos cheaper than the previous Model 3 in Mexico and 130,000 pesos less than the next-most expensive Model 3, the Long Range Dual-Motor All-Wheel-Drive. I'm not sure I'd call Mexico a ""developing"" market these days, but there certainly is demand for EVs like this down there.
And there's certainly demand for more affordable EVs everywhere these days. So the question is, could this variant come to the U.S.—and does it preview a possible approach for Tesla to offer cheaper options without having to craft entirely new models? Your guess is as good as mine, because Tesla isn't exactly transparent with product plans these days. But I do think there would be a market for such a thing in the U.S., especially given how popular these are for ride-share drivers.
A Model 3 with cloth seats: yes or no? Let us know in the comments.

2025 Lamborghini Temerario: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/730034/lamborghini-temerario-horsepower-engine-price-details/,"The Huracan’s replacement has 920 horsepower, three electric motors, and a V-8 with a ridiculous 10,000 rpm redline.",12/25/2024 9:02,"The Lamborghini Huracán is gone, which means its lovely naturally aspirated V-10 engine is dead, too. But fans of fast Lamborghinis need not worry, there’s a new super sports car from Sant'Agata Bolognese that promises to be even more thrilling: Meet the Lamborghini Temerario.
Lamborghini calls the Temerario a High-Performance Electrified Vehicle—or, HPEV—and it packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 plug-in hybrid setup with three electric motors. Total output is 920 horsepower, and it takes the Temerario just 2.7 seconds to reach 62 miles per hour. Top speed is 211 miles per hour.
Lamborghini built this new V-8 engine from the ground up. It has a 90-degree ""Hot V"" configuration and a flat-plane crankshaft, with two turbochargers running a maximum pressure of 36 psi. Cast aluminum alloy cylinder heads and titanium connecting rods help keep the weight down, while Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers in the valvetrain ensure the engine can spin up to 10,000 rpm.
Three oil-cooled, axial-flux electric motors join the V-8. Lamborghini stuck the rear motor between the engine and the transversely mounted eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. That electric motor alone produces up to 150 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque. The other two motors, located on the front axle, drive the front wheels and make 82 hp each. Yes, this new Lambo is all-wheel drive—but don't worry, there is a ""Drift Mode"" function that deploys torque at the rear wheels at three varying power levels. The Temerario also has a launch control function.
The battery pack has a capacity of 3.8 kilowatt hours. Plug the Temerario into a traditional AC charging port with up to 7 kilowatts of power, and the battery will recharge in 30 minutes. It can also be recharged through regenerative braking, or directly from the V-8 in as little as 6 minutes. You can drive using the front electric motors exclusively, but Lamborghini doesn't list an EV driving range for the Temerario.
Visually, the Temerario looks like a mix of the larger Revuelto and the outgoing Huracán. The headlights take up a small sliver of each corner of the hood—they’re slimmer even than the Huracán’s—and trendy hexagonal LED running lights sit just beneath them on each side of the front bumper. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fiber options.
In profile, the Temerario isn’t as sleek as the Huracán. It introduces a larger aerodynamic vent just ahead of the rear wheels that improves downforce by 103% compared to the Huracán Evo.
The Temerario Alleggerita lightweight package—with a larger rear wing, unique bumper treatments, and carbon fiber rims—debuts at launch and touts a 158% increase in downforce over the Huracán Evo, and a 55-pound weight reduction over the standard Temerario. Tack on the Carbon Pack, and that drops another 4 pounds through the use of carbon on the rear diffuser, mirror caps, and side air intakes.
Underneath the skin is a new lightweight chassis. Instead of the Huracán’s mixed aluminum and carbon-fiber build, the Temerario’s chassis is entirely aluminum. That yields a 50% drop in material use, 80% fewer heat-welded joints, and a 20% increase in torsional rigidity. It also helps keep the weight down.
Inside, the Tememerario has a cockpit-style cabin littered with hexagonal elements. Headroom improves by 1.3 inches over Huracán, and legroom improves by up to 1.8 inches. Even a 6-foot 6-inch NBA player could wear a helmet in this car, says Lamborghini.
An 8.4-inch vertical touchscreen graces the center of the dash, while the driver has access to a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and the passenger has a slightly smaller 9.1-inch touchscreen display.
One thing we don’t know yet is how much the Lamborghini Temerario costs. The outgoing Huracán Evo started at around $300,000 in the US, so it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility that the Temerario costs around $400,000 or even $500,000. We’ll know more about the Lamborghini Temerario when it goes on sale later this year or early in 2025.

The Rimac Nevera R Is Here. Its Specs Are Unbelievable,https://www.motor1.com/news/730067/rimac-nevera-r-revealed/,The Nevera R ditches the pretense of being a GT and becomes an all-out sports car. 0-60 mph takes 1.74 seconds.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Nobody has ever looked at the performance of a Rimac Nevera and thought “huh, maybe they’re holding back a bit.” But according to Rimac, the Nevera is a GT that happens to break records, not an all-out performance car. There was always more on the table, and now its being shown. Welcome to the 2,107 horsepower, 256 mile-per-hour, lowered, lightened, and wing-adorned Rimac Nevera R.
The Nevera R has all the typical stuff you'd expect from a hardcore track star—it’s lighter, more powerful, and more focused. Taking the bones of the Nevera meant that the R already had a spec sheet to end all spec sheets, but Rimac turned the wick up significantly. An extra 193 hp, a next-generation 108 kWh battery pack, and an undisclosed amount of weight reduction turn the Nevera R’s acceleration numbers comical. 0-60 mph takes just 1.74 seconds, 0-124 mph is an even more absurd 4.38 seconds, about as fast as a typical performance car’s 0-60 time. The most unbelievable numbers are the ¼ mile and 0-186 mph time. While it takes just 8.23 seconds to clear 1,320 feet, it takes just a little longer at 8.66 seconds for the Nevera R to reach 186 mph. It’s only the second street car in the 2,000 horsepower club after the Koenigsegg Gemera.
Acceleration is not the full story, however. In preparation to go record-smashing, the Nevera R also sees handling-focused upgrades. The new aero package includes a fixed wing, large diffuser, and a deeper front lip. The tires are now Michelin Cup 2s as standard, combined with more camber to produce more lateral traction. The All-Wheel Torque Vectoring program was retuned to take advantage of the extra mechanical and aero grip, while the steering system was refined for better response. Finally, a new generation of carbon ceramic brakes feature a silicone matrix layer to improve overall performance.
All said, the changes are good for a 3.8-second quicker lap time around the Nardo Handling Track. Dissecting that: The Nardo Handling Track is 3.8 miles long with a 0.6-mile long straightaway, which means the Nevera R is one second faster per mile of track. If that logic stands for the Nürburgring, then the Nevera R is almost certain to break the seven-minute barrier handily, and possibly take the challenge to the overall record holders. We’ll just have to wait and see.

The 2025 BMW M5 Touring Is A U.S.-Bound Plug-In Super Wagon,https://insideevs.com/news/730191/bmw-m5-touring-g99-reveal/,"BMW has only ever made two M5 wagons, and the G99 Touring is the third and most extreme.",8/15/2024 13:30,"BMW has pulled the wraps off the new G99 M5 Touring, the plug-in hybrid super wagon that’s coming to the United States. It has nearly identical specs and dimensions to the M5 sedan that we’ve already seen, but its long roof design makes it a third of an inch taller than the three-box.
It looks a lot like the i5 Touring M60 that we sampled not long ago but with blistered wheel arches and four exhausts poking out from under the massive diffuser. We really liked the look of the i5 Touring, which looks better in person than it does in the photos, and this M5 Touring will look even sportier, although it probably needs a darker color to hide its true size (and extra height over the previous generation of the model).
There has been a lot of talk about how much the M5 sedan weighs, which is 5,390 pounds, but the Touring variant is even heavier at 5,530 lbs. Getting this extra mass off the line adds one-tenth of a second to the acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph, which rises to 3.5 seconds. Both body styles are limited to 155 mph at the top end, which you can increase to 190 mph by selecting the optional M Driver’s Package.
The sprint time to 60 mph doesn’t tell the whole story with the M5. What’s more impressive is that it can hit 124 mph from a standstill in 11.1 seconds. Power is sent to all four wheels through a permanent xDrive system, but the car can decouple the front axle if all you want to do is turn the rear tires into smoke.
Power comes from the same twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 577 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. The eight-speed automatic gearbox incorporates a permanently excited synchronous electric motor, producing 194 hp and 207 lb-ft on its own. Total system output is a mighty 717 hp and 738 lb-ft, which should make the Touring’s extra 150 lbs disappear under hard acceleration.
The electric motor should feel even more torquey than it actually is, delivering “as much as 332 lb-ft at the transmission input for the motor with the help of a pre-gearing stage patented by BMW. This innovation enables the compact electric drive unit to generate effective propulsive power that could normally only be achieved using a far larger motor.”
Helping the car stick to the corners is an active four-wheel steering system coupled with variable-ratio steering. This system seems to rob new BMW models of some feel, but it improves the feeling of steering precision and you have to apply less lock to get the car to turn. There’s also an electronic M limited-slip differential working in the background to keep the rear of the car in check when you put the power down—it’s what also allows the car to pull massive smoky drifts.
With its 14.8 kWh battery, the M5 Touring has a maximum electric range of 25 miles and you can easily drive it at highway speeds on battery alone with its electric top speed of 87 mph. Charging the battery can only be done at up to 11 kW through the onboard AC charger; this isn’t one of those PHEVs that can DC fast-charge.
The interior layout is the same as in the sedan, with the same array of two curved screens dominating the dashboard. We’ve seen this interior in the i5 Touring, including the flat-bottom steering wheel with a red center marking, but the M5 will get more aggressive seats that are unique to the M model as well as other sporty touches to make it feel more special.
There’s also a big and very bright head-up display that projects directly onto the windscreen. What you see changes depending on the driving mode, but it can show you a full navigation map or a rev counter so that you don’t have to look down at the digital gauge cluster. The lower part of your field of view should catch the shift lights that appear at the top of the driver’s display.
The trunk grows from 16.5 cubic feet in the M5 sedan to 17.7 cu ft in the Touring. Folding the rear seat increases the available space to 57.6 cu ft. The M5 Touring comes with a pass-through so that you can carry skis inside the car without having to fold down any part of the rear seat.
When it arrives in the US, sometime after its Q4 2024 global launch, the M5 Touring will cost from $122,675 destination charge included.

"Pininfarina Battista Loses Its Roof, Instantly Gets Cooler",https://www.motor1.com/news/730211/pininfarina-battista-targamerica/,Pininfarina's electric hypercar becomes a targa for this one-off.,12/25/2024 9:02,"The Italians do convertibles so well. For further evidence, see this, the Pininfarina Battista Targamerica, an open-top version of the electric hypercar, which makes its debut Thursday for Monterey Car week.
The Targamerica is a coach-built one-off for a special Pininfarina client who already owns a Battista coupe. It's not the first convertible from the modern Automobili Pininfarina—that would be the B95 Speedster—but it is the first open-top Battista. It makes you wonder why the Battista wasn't a convertible to begin with.
Remarkably, it took just a year for the Targamerica to go from conception to reality, with the client comissioning the car at Monterey Car Week last year. Its silver-with-blue-accents livery pays homage to another one-off Pininfarina convertible, the Ferrari Testarossa Spider made for longtime Fiat scion Gianni Angelli in 1986. The rear decklid is unique to the Targamerica, too, as are the doors, which in the coupe are integrated into the roof. Another notable feature is a cigar humidor integrated between the seats. Apparently the client likes their stogies.
Pininfarina Battista Targamerica
As a brief reminder, the Battista is the creation of Automobili Pininfarina, a German-headquartered offshoot of the legendary Italian design house, owned by India's Mahindra. The Battista is based on the Rimac Nevera hypercar, and offers an astonishing 1,900 horsepower from its four electric motors.
Automobili Pininfarina is showing the Targamerica at The Quail on Friday, after which point the client will take delivery. The automaker didn't say whether it'll build more Battista convertibles, we suspect this won't be the last.

"The Charger EV Doesn't Have Fake Shifting, And That Kind Of Sucks",https://www.motor1.com/news/729684/dodge-charger-ev-drifts-donuts-acceleration-video/,"Dodge has revealed a whole lot more info about its Fratzonic ""exhaust"" system. And it's missing one big feature.",12/25/2024 9:02,"Dodge has released a whole lot of new information about the synthetic ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" system on its newest car, the Charger Daytona EV. The company has also published a video showing off the car doing donuts and acceleration pulls, complete with audio.
The Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust uses a custom enclosure mounted in the rear lower fascia of the Charger EV, paired with a dedicated amplifier that can produce up to 600 watts of power. Like most performance-minded EV noises, the exhaust uses input from the driver and the car to adjust sound and volume.
Specifically, the Fratzonic exhaust uses inputs like acceleration and deceleration, and makes noises when the car turns on and off. You can even ""rev"" the Charger EV, or just listen to it idle like any gas-powered car. It'll also make a distinct noise if you use the ""PowerShot"" function, which adds 40 horsepower for up to 15 seconds with the push of a button.
A two-minute video released by Dodge shows a Charger Daytona Scat Pack accelerating past a camera before pulling off a smoky donut. After that, we get a few seconds of the car ""idling."" It sounds like a real V-8 to us, but obviously, it's all still fake.
What we don't hear, strangely, are any simulated gears shifting. After Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, we suspected every performance EV going forward would have a feature like that, as it enhances the driving experience exponentially, and gives purpose to all of the synthetic noises. A Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 the Charger does not have any feature of the sort.
So even if you do enjoy the nice V-8 burble from the Charger EV, there's no way to bang through gears or bounce off a ""redline."" It's like pairing a Hemi to a CVT. And that sounds like no fun at all.
Are you a fan of the Fratzonic exhaust? Do you think Dodge made the right call not including fake gears? Let us know in the comments.

"The Dodge Charger EV's Frunk Is Optional, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/729505/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-frunk-optional/,"If you want a little extra storage in your Charger Daytona EV, you'll need to go for a pricey option package.",12/25/2024 9:02,"We noticed a curious detail in the press release announcing pricing for the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV. One of the features listed with the $4,995 Plus Group is, simply, ""Frunk."" Wait. Does this mean the front trunk is optional?
Indeed it does, a Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 yesterday.
Bizarrely, Dodge isn't the first to do this. At least in the U.K., the new Audi Q6 E-Tron's frunk is a £500 a-la-carte option. (Audi is yet to release packaging information on the U.S.-spec Q6 E-Tron.) But to the best of our recollection, that's the only other instance of this, EV or otherwise. In the Charger Daytona EV, it's not huge—a video from TFLEV notes it offers 1.5 cubic feet of storage—but it's enough for charging cables and other smaller items.
The Plus Group adds a number of other features to the Charger Daytona including cooled seats, LED lighting, a power rear hatch, wireless phone charging, 20 inch wheels for the base R/T model, and more. Still, this appears to be an odd bit of cost cutting—not including a simple piece of molded plastic under the hood as standard. But, the new Charger Daytona surely won't be as abundantly profitable as the old gas-powered Charger and Challenger, so Dodge has to find ways to eke out margins where it can.
The Charger Daytona is expensive as it is, too. Base price for the R/T is $61,950 and that rises to $75,185 for the Scat Pack, though both do qualify for a $7,500 tax credit when leased. Dodge may yet come out with cheaper models, though. A Dodge spokesperson tells us that ""[f]uture model years will see the Charger Daytona lineup expand to cover a larger portion of the muscle car segment.""

The Latest Rolls-Royce One-Off Is An Extremely Yellow Spectre,https://www.motor1.com/news/729067/rolls-royce-spectre-semaphore/,The Spectre Semaphore gets its own unique paint and a trippy two-tone hood.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Rolls-Royce is bringing something special to Monterey this year. This very yellow coupe is called the Spectre Semaphore, a one-off special build that wears a handful of bespoke customizations, including a trippy paint job for the hood and a very bright two-tone interior.
The flashy hue is called Semaphore Yellow, a color crafted specifically for this commission, says Rolls. On the hood is a unique artwork dubbed ""Marble Paint Spill."" Inspired by Californian artists, it's a collection of silver lacquer and multiple layers of clear coat to create what looks like a pool of mixed yellow and silver paint. Rolls-Royce says the hood alone required 160 hours of labor to design and produce.
Sticking with the very yellow color scheme, the interior of the Spectre Semaphore uses a combination of Lemon Yellow and Citrine Yellow to brighten the white seats, doors, and dashboard trim. Wrapping things together is Lemon Yellow stitching, naturally. Rolls was even able to make the center dial in the gauge cluster yellow.
There's no mention of drivetrain changes, meaning the Spectre Semaphore's dual-motor electric drivetrain is likely untouched. It's rated at a combined 577 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque from the factory, with up to 291 miles of range.
Rolls describes the Semaphore as capturing ""the bold new codes of luxury being established by the marque’s confident, youthful client base.""
Into the design? You're in luck. Unlike most bespoke commissions from the brand, this one hasn't been pre-sold. Rolls says it's available to purchase through any authorized dealer in the United States. Though presumably, you'll have to act fast since this is the only one that exists.
The one-off Spectre will make its debut at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering, on August 16 during Monterey Car Week.

Dodge's New EV 'Exhaust' Sounds Way Better Than We Expected,https://www.motor1.com/news/729243/dodge-charger-ev-new-v8-sound/,"It might not be a real V-8, but it's pretty convincing.",12/25/2024 9:02,"Dodge's new all-electric Charger is shrouded in controversy. Not only is the Hemi V-8 gone, but it's been replaced with a fake ""Fratzonic"" exhaust sound that doesn't have the internet convinced. The latest version of the sound, revealed this week, should convince at least a few people, though.
The company published a video to Instagram on Monday showing off the latest iteration of the Fratzonic exhaust. We watch and listen as a Charger Daytona EV blasts through a tunnel, outputting what sounds like a good old-fashioned V-8 sound.
The sound is a far cry from the original noise out of the debut in 2022, which was met with a ton of hate. In 2023, Dodge went as far as to change the sound with something resembling an engine, which sounded better but seemingly failed to convince the buying public. And while this latest noise sounds almost exactly like a real V-8, the internet isn't buying it.
""Lol we want real V-8 noises ... not a speaker,"" one comment reads. ""We still want HEMIs,"" says another. ""I’d rather have no car than one of these,"" one commenter says.
Dodge has voiced its struggles with the Fratzonic exhaust since its original reveal. ""We've changed it 100 times,"" CEO Tim Kuniskis confessed to reporters back in March. The system uses a speaker (or speakers) mounted inside an exhaust-like chamber to mimic the sound of a real exhaust.
Judging by the public's reaction to this whole fake exhaust speaker thing, it's clear that people don't actually care whether an electric car sounds like an ICE-powered car or not. Even if the Charger Daytona EV sounds exactly like a Hellcat, people won't be convinced, because they'll know it's not the real thing.
It's like slapping an M badge on a non-M BMW. The only people that care about the badge will also know it's a fake. Likewise, anyone that cares about the exhaust sound coming from a Charger EV will know it's not the real thing.

The A6 E-Tron Is Audi's First Rear-Wheel Drive Sedan In A Century,https://www.motor1.com/news/728466/audi-a6-e-tron-rwd/,"No, really. To find another rear-drive Audi sedan, you have to go back before the War.",12/25/2024 9:02,"A rear-wheel drive sedan isn't abnormal, but one with Audi's four rings on the front? That is very, very unusual. But believe it or not, the base Audi A6 E-Tron—the new electric version of Audi's longstanding mid-size sedan—drives just its rear wheels.
Audi is, of course, a brand defined by its Quattro all-wheel drive system, but it built front-wheel drive cars for much of its history. You have to go all the way back to the Audi 920 of the late 1930s to find an earlier rear-wheel drive Audi sedan than this new A6. And for all of its modern history, the company has only built front or all-wheel drive cars. The only exceptions are the rear-wheel drive versions of the R8 supercar and the base Q4 E-Tron crossover.
Quick history lesson: Audi was formed around the turn of the 20th century, and in 1932, it became part of the Auto Union along with fellow German companies Horch, Wanderer, and DKW. Hence the four rings of the Audi logo. After the War, the Audi name was dropped until the mid-1960s, when Auto Union revived it in favor of DKW.
Most modern Audis can trace their lineage to the DKW F9, which was designed in the early days of World War II as a successor to the Volkswagen Beetle. As an excellent video from the B Sport YouTube channel explains, Auto Union ran with the F9's drivetrain layout of a longitudinal engine ahead of a transmission sending power to the front wheels. In gas-powered cars larger than the A3, it's the layout Audi still uses to this day, albeit often with the addition of a driveshaft going to the rear in the classic Quattro all-wheel drive system. This includes the A6 and all its predecessors.
All of this is to say that there are decades of tradition here, which the A6 E-Tron breaks with. Of course, many single-motor EVs are rear-wheel drive for a variety of reasons, so on some level, it's not that unusual. Plus, the A6's rivals—the Tesla Model S, BMW i5, and Mercedes EQE—are all rear-wheel drive in base form. Still, it's astonishing that this is the first modern, rear-wheel-drive Audi sedan.
Going electric changes everything. This break from tradition doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things, yet it's certainly notable given Audi's history. But, a rear-wheel drive sedan is almost always a good thing, so the base A6 E-Tron might be a sweet spot in the Audi range.

This Is The Most Powerful Porsche Panamera Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/727030/most-powerful-porsche-panamera-ever/,The pricey Turbo S E-Hybrid arrives alongside a new GTS.,12/25/2024 9:02,"Days after setting a Nürburgring record, the hottest Panamera of them all is official. Porsche debuted the Turbo S E-Hybrid equipped with an electrified V-8 engine making serious power. Not only is it more potent than its predecessor but it also comes with a substantial battery upgrade. Sticky tires, a carbon fiber aero kit, and a rich list of standard equipment boost its appeal.
At the heart of the range-topper is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter engine making 591 horsepower. Built into the eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, the electric motor belts out another 187 hp. Together, the two deliver a combined 771 hp, lending the new Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid a substantial 81-hp advantage over the old model. At the same time, torque has jumped by 96 pound-feet to a mountain-moving 737 lb-ft.
Courtesy of the extra electrified muscle, the flagship Panamera is now two-tenths of a second quicker to 60 mph by completing the task in just 2.8 seconds. Flat out, it hits 202 mph, making it 8 mph faster than the old one. But wait, it gets even better. Porsche has increased the gross capacity of the battery pack by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, resulting in a higher electric range.
Sitting at the top of the food chain, the (takes a deep breath) Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid gets the good stuff as standard. The ceramic brakes are included from the get-go, as are the forged 21-inch centerlock wheels. There are still a few boxes on the options list you can tick, namely an aero kit and Michelin tires. The former increases downforce by 132 pounds at 124 mph while the latter is a bespoke Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber.
Porsche is already accepting orders and wants an eye-watering $228,495 before options. If that’s out of your price range, the Panamera lineup also adds a GTS trim for the 2025 model year. The Gran Turismo Sport costs a more attainable $156,195, with both prices including destination and handling feels. While the Turbo S E-Hybrid is the most powerful of the lot, the GTS is claimed to be the most agile.
2025 Porsche Panamera GTS
The Panamera GTS packs 493 hp or 20 hp more than the previous generation. It needs 3.6 seconds to hit 60 mph from a standstill, so it's a tenth of a second quicker. At full tilt, it does 188 mph. Compared to a more plebian version, the GTS sits 0.4 inches lower after tweaking the standard air suspension. In addition, the engineers from Zuffenhausen have beefed up the anti-roll bars and worked on the limited-slip differential for a more engaging drive.
Both new flavors of the Panamera will reach US dealers near the end of Q1 2025.

Chevy Silverado EV's More Affordable LT Trim: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/726794/silverado-ev-lt-trail-boss/,The cheaper LT model and off-road-ready Silverado EV Trail Boss are due next year.,7/16/2024 12:00,"Chevrolet's Silverado EV is still only trickling out of the factory. We’ve only seen two trims of the electric full-sized pickup truck: the fleet-oriented WT trim and the fully loaded, nearly six-figure RST trim. But now, Chevy has released images and some details of the more moderately priced yet still well-equipped versions of the Silverado EV in LT trim on its website.
Right now, both the WT and RST trucks on sale are far from cheap. The RST’s roughly $96,000 MSRP is way out of the realm of affordability for many truck buyers. It’s also well above its direct competitor, the Ford F-150 Lightning. The WT trim is somewhat cheaper at around $75,000, but that, too, is very expensive.
Also, its black bumpers, steel wheels, and spartan interior trim won’t be to the tastes of the average consumer, who would appreciate a bit of glitz and glamour with their electric pickup.
General Motors Has Best Quarter Ever For EVs
General Motors's EV sales were up 40% compared to last year. Q2 was its best quarter ever for EV sales, with the Silverado EV and Blazer EV making up a substantial portion of its sales numbers.
This Silverado EV in LT trim splits the difference, adding style without going overboard and increasing the price too much. The LT model has a slightly different front bumper, but still has the LED light bar and illuminated Chevrolet badge as the topmost RST trim. It has large two-tone wheels. However, the cladding along the wheel arches and rocker panels is matte grey like the WT trim, instead of gloss black like on the RST model.
2025 Silverado EV LT Rear
Equipment-wise, the LT should be a step up from the WT as it will include some features we’ve already seen on that top-level truck. It will have the same 17.7-inch infotainment and 11.3-inch driver display screens, running the same Google-based (and Apple CarPlay-less) software. It does appear that the convertible Multi-Flex Tailgate, which allows the truck bed’s tailgate to accommodate much longer loads, will be an option.
Chevrolet also released an image of the Silverado EV Trail Boss but didn’t include many details aside from a picture and the promise that it will be able to “tackle anything from twisted trails to tight turns” and have “superior capability and groundbreaking technology.”
Chevy Silverado EV Trail Boss
We don’t know much about the new models' range, power, or price quite yet. But we expect the Silverado LT to have a smaller battery than the RST’s massive 213 kWh pack and way less power than the staggering 754 horsepower figure of the top-of-the-line truck. When it goes on sale in 2025, the Silverado EV LT could start around $60,000, making it a much more affordable option than the $96,000 Silverado EV RST First Edition we drove recently—and a more direct competitor to the F-150 Lightning.

Nissan Ariya Nismo Heads To Europe To Resurrect Performance Brand,https://insideevs.com/news/726776/nissan-ariya-nismo-ev-europe/,"With several performance tweaks, the go-fast Ariya crossover is the first Nismo-branded car in Europe since the 370Z went bust.",7/16/2024 10:00,"Nismo, Nissan’s performance arm, will return to Europe with the battery-powered Ariya crossover after a four-year hiatus.
But unlike the version that’s available in Japan, the Europe-bound Nissan Ariya Nismo might be more show and less go, at least from the information we currently have on hand. That’s quite different from what European customers have been accustomed to in the past with Nismo-branded models like the 370Z and Juke, which had more power and pizzaz than the standard versions.
Nismo returns to Europe
After the demise of the Nissan 370Z in Europe at the end of 2019, the Japanese automaker's performance arm, Nismo, has been nowhere to be seen. That's about to change with the introduction of the Ariya Nismo sporty electric crossover.
The official press release doesn’t mention specifics about power, torque, acceleration or top speed, but a dead giveaway is the following statement: “The Ariya NISMO brings a new level of exhilaration to the already excellent performance of the 87KWh Ariya e-4ORCE.”
More Nissan Ariya News
That’s the version with the biggest battery and dual motors, which makes 389 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque–both in Europe and the United States. That’s not to say it’s short on power, but to put things into perspective, the most powerful version of the Japanese-spec Ariya Nismo, dubbed B9, gets a 91-kWh battery and a maximum output of 320 hp and 443 lb-ft. Compared to the regular Ariya, that’s 10% higher.
That said, for Europe, Nismo fine-tuned the e-4ORCE all-wheel drive system for better power and torque distribution, tweaked the suspension, installed “finely tuned” brake pads and revised the interior to make it sportier. Inside, the color theme is red on black with Nismo seats.
Outside, the Nissan Ariya Nismo gets a black-and-red body kit, new 20-inch wheels, revised front and rear bumpers and a rear spoiler above the rear window.
That’s a big bummer for Nismo fans. Cars like the discontinued 370Z Nismo and even the peculiar Juke Nismo had more of everything, including power, making for some very interesting driving characteristics. Now though, it seems like Nismo is becoming the equivalent of Mercedes-Benz’s AMG Line, BMW’s M Sport and Hyundai’s N Line trim options.
The European version of the go-fast electric crossover will be fully unveiled during the season finale of the Formula E championship in London this weekend when we should learn more about the Ariya Nismo, like how much power it actually makes and how much it costs.
The sporty EV will be available in all European markets where the regular version is already available, Nissan said.",Iulian Dnistran
The Lucid Air Just Hit A Huge EV Milestone,https://insideevs.com/news/726704/lucid-air-2025-efficiency-range/,"The EV startup announced some tweaks to its 2025 lineup. Most notably, the Air is now the country's most efficient EV by a wide margin.",7/16/2024 9:00,"Lucid announced tweaks to its Air sedan lineup for the 2025 model year on Tuesday. The biggest development? The startup’s entry-level model now achieves a landmark 5 miles of driving range per kilowatt-hour (kWh), making it the most efficient electric car you can buy, according to Lucid's calculations.
The 2025 Air Pure manages to eke out 420 miles of Environmental Protection Agency-estimated range from an 84-kWh battery pack. Note that EPA ratings are for plug-to-road efficiency, including charging losses, so EPA efficiency figures won't match the 5.0 mi/kWh Lucid claims. The good news, though, is that the added efficiency doesn't come with added cost. The 2025 model costs $69,900, just like before.
Lucid Motors
The California-based EV startup began selling the Air sedan in 2021. It's earned a reputation for exceptional technology but hasn't turned a profit yet. The company is betting its upcoming Gravity SUV and future models will bring it mass-market volumes and financial stability.
“Lucid Air is the very embodiment of our relentless approach to optimization, enabling Air Pure to use less electrical energy than any other vehicle for any journey taken, A to B,” said Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO of Lucid, in a statement.
According to the EPA, which doesn't list the 2025 Air Pure on its website yet, the most efficient EV in the U.S. is the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6, rated at 4.2 mi/kWh. The Tesla Model 3 and 2024 Air Pure are up near the top too, while big pickup trucks like the Ford F-150 Lightning require considerably more energy to propel themselves than those energy-sipping models. Lucid said it got to 5 mi/kWh by adding a heat pump, which can cool and heat the Pure’s cabin with less energy, and through other tweaks.
On its face, EV efficiency may sound dull compared to more tangible, exciting specs like range and neck-snapping zero-to-60-mph times. But maximizing efficiency is a key way to make EVs work better for people, and it’s a central philosophy for Rawlinson and Lucid.
Better efficiency means the company can shrink its battery packs, thus reducing input costs for each vehicle. Indeed, the 2024 Air Pure has an 88-kWh pack and gets ever so slightly less EPA range than the 2025 model. For drivers, less energy consumption contributes to speedier charging stops, because every kWh dispensed results in more mileage.
Lucid announced a few other updates to 2025 Airs, which are available to order as of Tuesday. A heat pump, which previously was only found in top-end models, is now standard across the board. The infotainment system has triple the processing power and twice the memory of the previous generation, which Lucid said results in a “significantly enhanced and faster in-car infotainment experience.”
More EV Startup News
All Airs now come with DreamDrive Premium, which adds a 360-degree camera view and blind-spot camera views to the car’s driver-assistance suite. The Air Touring and Grand Touring each get a $1,000 price hike, bringing them to $78,900 and $110,900, respectively. The 2025 Grand Touring has an estimated 512 miles of range, slightly less than before but still by far the most of any electric car in the U.S.
The next couple of years will be pivotal for Lucid. Even if it has some of the best technology in the EV market—and this efficiency milestone solidifies that—it has yet to make a profitable business out of that.
The startup is burning through cash quickly—it reported a net loss of $2.8 billion in 2023—and is largely looking past the Air for future growth. It hopes that the Gravity SUV (which starts production later this year) and its upcoming more affordable vehicle will deliver the kinds of volumes needed for financial sustainability.

Porsche's New Macan Trim Addresses Its Biggest Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/726721/porsche-macan-macan-4s-specs-price/,"The newly introduced rear-wheel drive Porsche Macan is the cheapest of the bunch, but there’s also a new Macan 4S.",7/16/2024 8:00,"The 2024 Porsche Macan is available in two new trim levels that complete the electric crossover’s range, at least for now. Furthermore, a new off-road design pack can be specced as an option for all versions.
After debuting in Macan 4 and Macan Turbo trims at the beginning of the year, the German EV can be had in either rear-wheel drive form (called simply Macan) or in Macan 4S guise.
A Macan for (nearly) everybody
In usual Porsche fashion, the all-electric Macan was first available in some of its priciest versions, but that's fixed now, as the German company launched two more trims, including a new entry-level model called simply Macan. It's the only rear-wheel drive trim and it's also the cheapest, but don't call it cheap.
The introduction of the base Macan solves one of the biggest problems with the battery-powered sports crossover, and that’s the price. But while it is the cheapest of the lineup, starting at $77,295 including destination, you can’t exactly call it cheap. Meanwhile, the Macan 4S, which slots between the Macan 4 and Macan Turbo, starts at $86,895 including destination charge.
More Porsche EV Stories
All versions are powered by the same 800-volt, 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack that can be recharged at a maximum rate of 270 kilowatts for a 10 to 80% top-up in around 21 minutes, according to Porsche.
The entry-level, rear-wheel drive Macan has a single electric motor–the same as the one fitted on the rear axle of the Macan 4–that has a maximum output of 250 kW (335 horsepower) and 415 pound-feet of torque with Launch Control enabled. The zero to 60 miles per hour sprint is done in 5.4 seconds, while the top speed is 136 miles per hour.
The cheapest electric Macan is also the lightest, with Porsche saying that it’s 243 pounds thinner than the Macan 4. This means it will likely boast the longest driving range of the lineup, seeing how all trims have the same battery, but the German automaker doesn’t have exact range numbers yet, and the EPA ratings aren’t available either.
When the Macan 4 and Macan Turbo debuted earlier this year, the WLTP rating was between 321-381 miles, so it’s possible that the new, lighter Macan RWD could go at least 300 miles on a full charge in real-world conditions, but we’ll have to see it to believe it.
Moving on to the more powerful Macan 4S, it features a beefier rear electric motor and a stronger 600-amp silicon carbide pulse inverter, whereas the rear-wheel drive Macan has a 480-amp pulse inverter with silicon carbide transistors.
Porsche says the new Macan 4S has a total system output of 330 kW (442 hp) with a maximum output of up to 380 kW (509 hp) when overboost is engaged. With Launch Control activated, the maximum torque is 578 lb-ft, allowing for a 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.9 seconds.
So, for a quick roundup of the Macan lineup, we have the rear-wheel drive version with up to 335 hp and 415 lb-ft, the Macan 4 with up to 402 hp and 479 lb-ft, the Macan 4S with up to 509 hp and 578 lb-ft, and finally the Macan Turbo with up to 630 hp and 833 lb-ft. Traditionally, Porsche has offered a Turbo S variant of its cars at some point during their lives, so it could be possible that the electric Macan will get an even more powerful trim, but we’ll have to wait and see if that happens.
Getting back to the new stuff, both the rear-drive Macan and the Macan 4S come as standard with Porsche’s Adaptive Air Suspension and the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), while rear-wheel steering is optional. On the Macan 4S, customers can also choose the Torque Vectoring Plus feature from the options list.
The German sports car also introduced a new off-road design package that can be applied to any Macan trim. It includes a new front bumper that improves the approach angle to 17.5 degrees depending on the model and with the air suspension raised to its highest level. With the standard air suspension in the normal setting, the off-road design package increases the ground clearance by four-tenths of an inch (10 millimeters) to a total of 7.6 inches and tops out at 8.8 inches in its highest setting.
A new exterior color called Slate Grey Neo, as well as a 20-inch wheel design for the Macan S are new arrivals on the features list.
The 2024 Porsche Macan and 2024 Porsche Macan 4S are available to order now, with deliveries expected to begin in the fourth quarter. The electric Macan is manufactured in Leipzig, Germany, so it’s not eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit when purchasing, but leasing might make it eligible.",Iulian Dnistran
New Ford Capri: Here's A Detailed Video Walkaround,https://insideevs.com/news/726241/ford-capri-video-preview/,"Is this tall electric sedan a ""real"" Capri? If the Mustang Mach-E is any indication, that question may not matter.",7/11/2024 9:11,"My first thought when I saw the reactions to the new Ford Capri online: ""Here we go again.""
There's apparently a lot of hand-wringing about whether this new Capri is a ""real Capri"" or not. After all, this new car is an electric four-door sedan-hatch thing with a ride height that gives it SUV vibes, while the old Capri was an iconic European performance coupe—two doors, classic proportions and aimed at younger buyers who wanted something exciting.
Ford's challenges in Europe
Like a lot of automakers, Ford is losing ground in China and now it's facing Chinese EV rivals in Europe too, where it has long had a strong presence. Using VW's electric platform may help Ford get more cars on the road in the interim, but eventually, it's got to find ways to seriously compete in Europe or back down like General Motors did.
This will sound familiar to anyone who saw, or participated in, the online debates about whether the Ford Mustang Mach-E is a ""real Mustang"" or not. And I think the end result will be the same with the Capri: it won't matter. If the Capri is good enough, it'll stand on its own merits, just like the Mach-E does.
Of course, this situation is a bit different, since critics will likely argue that it's not even a ""real"" Ford. Underneath the Capri's handsome-but-blatantly-Polestar-ish skin is Volkswagen's MEB platform, such that it's basically a Ford-themed reskin of the Volkswagen ID.5. VW had long intended to license out its MEB platform to other automakers, and since Ford doesn't yet have its own true, dedicated EV architecture—cars like the Mach-E and F-150 Lightning are extensively modified versions of gas-powered platforms—this move helps the American automaker get more EVs on the road more quickly. This will change when Ford gets its own purpose-built EV platform out the door, but that's still a few years off.
Then again, how much does your everyday, average buyer know or care what platform their EV uses? I'm reminded of that stat about how many BMW drivers didn't know they had rear-wheel-drive cars, so the Bavarians started cranking out more front-wheel-drive ones instead.
Ford Capri (2024)
From what I can see across the pond where the car will not be sold, there's a lot to like here. Over at the Electrifying YouTube channel, host Ginny Buckley—who's a Capri fan and skeptic of the new design—says to ""put that car out of your mind"" as she dives deep into the coupe-SUV. She notes that this new Capri would absolutely smoke any of the previous gas versions, and it offers single- and dual-motor versions and even an upcoming smaller battery size for buyers who don't need as much distance.
Buckley notes that the Capri does look considerably better than the also-VW-based Ford Explorer EV. The ""boot"" here definitely takes a page from the Polestar 2 playbook (if not the entire book) with a fastback-type hatch opening and a good amount of space with the rear seats down. The rear doors, however, seem pretty narrow, especially when you're on carseat duty.

But there are some nice nods to the original Capri too, including ones this clueless American writer didn't know about. The headrests are integrated into the entire seat, old-school-style, and the steering wheel has a metallic 6 p.m. spoke with rally-style holes in it.
The center touch screen can slide forward or back, tilting to be flush against the dashboard or more angled for easier driver reach. The Capri also boasts an upgraded software system from what's in the Mach-E, and charger location and app integration are better than ever. So, yes; these cars use a Ford software system, not a Volkswagen one. And the rest of the interior doesn't scream VW either, it's all pretty cohesive in there.
Will European audiences warm up to this new electric Capri? Even Buckley admits it's maybe not as aspirational as the original coupe was, and the Polestar 2's sales haven't exactly been setting new records as of late. But it could help Ford gain some ground in the EV race, where it's particularly behind in Europe.
I know most Americans have no idea what a Capri is unless they have vague memories of Mercury, but I wish this thing was sold on our side of the Atlantic too. I'm weirdly into it.

Mini John Cooper Works Electric: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/725200/mini-cooper-jcw-ev-official/,"It’s supposed to be covered in camouflage, but we can see everything, Mini.",7/3/2024 18:01,"The previous-generation Mini hatchback in John Cooper Works trim was a hoot to drive. Now, with the latest-gen model, the British marque is adamant that the go-kart feeling won’t go anywhere, even in the case of the all-electric version.
Say hello, then, to the all-new Mini John Cooper Works E, albeit in prototype form. These are the first official photos of the sporty three-door EV hatchback which will make its dynamic debut at next week’s Goodwood Festival of Speed in the United Kingdom. But wait, wasn’t there a JCW Mini already? Well, yes, but only sort of. Let me explain.
Will Mini's smallest EV come to the U.S.?
As of today, the only all-new Minis available in the United States are the gas-powered Countryman crossover and three- and four-door Cooper hatchbacks. In the case of the battery-powered Cooper, including the new John Cooper Works, it might never make it here because it's made in China and Chinese-built EVs face huge import tariffs starting next month.
The latest-gen Mini Cooper EV is indeed available with some JCW badges if you want to spend some extra cash over the basic version, but it’s just a trim level. Think BMW’s M Sport models–they’re not true M cars but they carry M badges. BMW makes money and the owner is happy, so Mini is going down the same route.
More Stories About Mini
The new Mini John Cooper Works E, however, is the real deal. Expected to go on sale toward the end of this year or early next year, the top-spec three-door electric Mini could get up to 250 horsepower from a front-mounted electric motor fed by a roughly 50-kilowatt-hour battery.
These specs aren’t official, though, so take them with a grain of salt. That said, the production Mini Cooper SE has 214 hp and a 54.2-kWh battery pack that’s good for a WLTP-rated range of 249 miles on a full charge. Mini will likely use the same battery to feed a slightly more potent e-motor at the front, all while tuning the chassis to supercharge the go-kart feeling that the brand’s models are known for.
The company didn’t say a thing about what’s new and improved on the upcoming John Cooper Works E, but we have eyes and can spot a sportier front bumper, a pretty consistent roof-mounted spoiler at the rear and an integrated diffuser in the rear bumper. There are no photos of the interior, but we expect a pretty similar look to the JCW trim that’s available on the Cooper SE, including a round infotainment screen, funky dashboard covers and a JCW-themed steering wheel and seats.
Mini did say that the prototype that will race up the Goodwood hill climb is covered in a camouflage designed to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the historic win at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally where a Mini Cooper S finished first. The company also said that besides an electric version, the new John Cooper Works will also be available with a combustion engine.",Iulian Dnistran
"2026 Genesis Electrified G80 Packs Bigger Battery, 27-Inch Screen",https://insideevs.com/news/724837/2026-genesis-electrified-g80-facelift-specs-battery-interior/,The updated battery-powered sedan debuted in its home country of South Korea with a longer wheelbase and more niceties inside.,6/28/2024 8:00,"In the realm of electric sedans, you may not think of the Genesis Electrified G80 all that much. It's hardly a big-volume, mainstream car for Genesis or even the Hyundai Motor Group as a whole. But with some upgrades for 2026, the battery-powered G80 may be more worth your attention than ever.
Revealed at this year’s Busan International Mobility Show (BIMOS) in South Korea, the updated sedan has a longer wheelbase, a bigger battery pack and more niceties inside and out.
Electric G80 follows in the combustion version's footsteps
The gas-powered Genesis G80 got a mid-cycle refresh last year, and now it's time for the battery-powered model to get many of the same updates.
Expected to arrive in the United States later this year as a 2026 model, the new Electrified G80 will likely boast an improved range rating compared to the current EPA estimate of 282 miles on a full charge.
Let’s start with the technical stuff. The redesigned Electrified G80 has a 5.1-inch longer wheelbase compared to the outgoing model (123.6 in versus 118.5 in), which allowed Genesis to stuff a slightly larger lithium-ion battery pack into the floor–95.4 kilowatt-hours versus the old 87.2 kilowatt-hours unit.
More Genesis Stories
As a result, the range rating in its home market went up from 265 miles to 295 miles on a full charge, an 11% improvement. The range rating (or any other specifics, for that matter) isn’t yet available for the U.S. market, but applying the same 11% increase would result in a theoretical EPA range of 313 miles. Take that with a grain of salt, though, at least until Genesis brings the updated sedan stateside.
Even though the Korean automaker said the wheelbase was increased, it didn’t mention anything about the length of the car. The outgoing model is 197 inches long, so logic dictates the updated model would measure 202.1 inches long, but we’ll know more when the EV officially comes to the States.
The same extended wheelbase that made more room for a bigger battery pack is responsible for some extra legroom for the rear passengers, who can now benefit from plush VIP reclining seats with leg rests and a memory feature. Meanwhile, the new EasyClose system allows them to close the doors with a push of a button–just like in a Rolls-Royce.
Up front, the old 14.5-inch center infotainment screen is gone, and in its place, there’s a new, 27-inch OLED display that combines the gauge cluster and infotainment under a single piece of glass.
Outside, the company’s so-called G-Matrix Crest Grille has been slightly redesigned, the headlights now feature something called Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology and there are new chrome details all around the zero-emissions sedan. Dish-style 19-inch wheels are offered as standard and the front bumper has also been slightly tweaked, design-wise.
The facelifted Genesis Electrified G80 will go on sale in South Korea in August, with Europe, the United States and other global markets soon to follow. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but we expect the 2026 Electrified G80 to be slightly more expensive than the outgoing model which starts at $75,625 (including destination).",Iulian Dnistran
Hyundai Inster: This New Affordable Electric City Car Looks Fantastic,https://insideevs.com/news/723917/hyundai-inster-ev-official-range-power-specs-price/,"Based on the South Korean-spec Casper, Hyundai’s new city EV goes to Europe with an extended wheelbase and two battery options.",6/26/2024 20:45,"This is the all-new Hyundai Inster. An entry-level, A-segment electric city car designed specifically for Europe that will likely compete with the Chinese-made Dacia Spring, which is one of the cheapest cars on sale in the European Union.
Keen-eyed observers might have noticed that the new Inster looks pretty much identical to the Korean-market Casper, and you’d be right. But looks aren’t everything, as Hyundai seems to have done its homework and didn’t just slap some lipstick and bolt a big battery under what was originally a combustion-powered urban runabout.
The race for affordable EVs is on
First, there was the Dacia Spring EV, which debuted with a starting price of around $20,000 in Europe a few years ago. Now, more and more automakers are trying to cash in on the affordable EV craze in Europe, including Stellantis, Volkswagen and Hyundai.
The biggest change for the European-bound Inster EV is a stretched, 101.5-inch (2,580-millimeter) wheelbase, bringing it closer to a subcompact or B-segment car. That’s 7 inches more than the gas-powered Casper it’s based on, 6 inches more than the Dacia Spring and 10 inches more than the rather pricy Fiat 500e.
More Affordable EV Stories
Measuring 150.6 inches long, 63.3 inches wide and 62 inches tall, the new Inster EV is about 6 inches longer, 2.7 inches narrower and its wheelbase is 6.1 inches longer than the entry-level combustion Hyundai i10. All of this should translate into more than a decent interior room for the size of the car, but bear in mind that it’s still pretty small by American standards–the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt subcompact EV is almost 10 inches longer while the wheelbase is 1 inch longer.
Two battery powertrain options will be available. The entry-level Inster will come with a 42-kilowatt-hour battery and a 71.1-kilowatt (95-horsepower) electric motor, while the fancier version will get a 49-kWh battery pack and an 84.5-kW (113 hp) motor. The torque figure is 108 pound-feet (147 Newton-meters) for both.
For the base battery pack, Hyundai expects a WLTP range of 186 miles (300 km). With this version, the zero to 62 miles per hour sprint can be achieved in 11.7 seconds, while the top speed is 87 miles per hour (140 kilometers per hour).
Hyundai Inster (2024)
In the case of the Inster with the larger battery, Hyundai targets a WLTP-rated range of 220 miles (355 km), which is 80 miles more than the Dacia Spring is capable of. The power output of the Inster is also almost double compared to the Spring’s maximum 48 kW (64 hp), allowing it to sprint to 62 in 10.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 93 mph (150 kph). The Inster also boasts a battery heating system and a heat pump.
Hyundai said that both battery versions can be topped up from 10% to 80% state of charge in roughly 30 minutes when hooked up to a 120 kW DC fast charger. The company claims the energy consumption is 15.3 kWh/100 km or 4.06 miles/kWh.
The standard onboard AC charger is rated at 11 kW and there’s vehicle-to-load capability built-in, but the company didn’t say what’s the maximum power output.
Hyundai Inster (2024) V2L
As a reminder, the new Inster is not based on the EV-specific E-GMP platform that’s used for larger models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV9. Instead, it uses an ICE platform that has been adapted for an electric powertrain.
On the outside, the new affordable EV comes with digital-pixel LED daytime running lights and rear LED lights as standard. Three wheel options are available, starting with 15-inch steelies with wheel covers as part of the base package, while 15- and 17-inch alloys can be specced for extra cash.
Inside, the Hyundai Inster EV has seating for four, but a five-seater version is coming next year. At the front, the floor is flat and there’s no center console between the seats, allowing the driver to easily scooch to the right and get out of the car through the front passenger’s door if there’s not enough space on the driver’s side.
The rear seats can slide front and rear to increase or decrease the legroom and cargo space. With the seats moved all the way back, the trunk has a volume of 8.4 cubic feet (238 liters). Sliding them all the way forward increases that figure to 12.4 cu ft (351 l) while folding them flat will result in a cargo volume of 37.4 cu ft (1,059 liters).
A pair of 10.25-inch screens–one for the digital instrument cluster and one for the infotainment system–come as standard, as well as a one-touch sunroof, a heated steering wheel, a wireless charging pad for smartphones and a pretty long list of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), including smart cruise control with stop and go, forward collision-avoidance assistance, surround-view monitor, lane-keeping assist and lane-following assist. Wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also available.
The Korean automaker hasn’t released the pricing for the all-new Inster EV. However, we know from previous reports that quoted Hyundai France boss Lionel Keogh, who said that the entry-level battery-powered hatchback would be priced around €20,000, which is roughly $21,500 at current exchange rates, including value-added tax (VAT).",Iulian Dnistran
"Volvo EX30 Delayed In America Until 2025, Production Moving To Belgium",https://insideevs.com/news/724655/volvo-ex30-delayed-china/,Volvo's affordable compact EX30 won't arrive this year after all. Blame the new tariffs on China-built EVs.,6/26/2024 13:11,"The compact electric Volvo EX30 won't be coming to the U.S. in 2024 after all.
A Volvo Cars USA spokesperson told InsideEVs today that the EX30's debut has been delayed to 2025 while the automaker moves production to Ghent, Belgium, instead of China, as was originally planned.
""Today Volvo Car USA is informing retailers and EX30 preorder customers that due to changes in the global automotive landscape, the U.S. introduction of the EX30 will be delayed while we ramp up production at our plant in Ghent, Belgium, with a 2025 target delivery date to be announced,"" the spokesperson said.
Volvo is the first to fall to new tariffs
New 100% tariffs on China-made EVs will keep them out of the U.S. market, for now. But most automakers operating in America realize that they'll have to compete with BYD, Geely and others eventually.
The move is a shocking reversal of Volvo's earlier plans to release a smaller and more affordable car than it's ever deployed across global markets, and an electric one at that. Unveiled last year, the EX30 drew immediate attention for its minimalist design, respectable range and, most importantly, a starting price of around $35,000 in the U.S.
Key to that price tag was where the car was built: in China, at factories owned by Geely Group, the parent company of Volvo. Due to various advancements in technology, heavy subsidies and drastically lower labor costs, many of China's EVs are priced considerably lower than their Western competitors.
But fears of cheap Chinese EVs flooding into the U.S. market and undercutting local automakers—a situation that is already playing out in Europe—led the Biden Administration to issue new 100% tariffs on electric cars from that country. While those tariffs are largely keeping Chinese automakers like BYD and Li Auto out of the U.S. for now, they will also affect China-built EVs from brands that operate here, including Volvo and Polestar.
That outcome meant that China-built EX30s likely would've come in at a much higher price than initially announced. A big price increase for such a small vehicle would've made the EX30 a tough sell in the U.S.
The Volvo spokesperson hasn't yet returned a request for more information about how the EX30's move to European production could affect its pricing, or what options and trim levels will be offered in the U.S. market. But it is still definitely coming.
""Importantly, we remain committed to bringing EX30 to the US and are working hard to get it into customer hands,"" the Volvo spokesperson told InsideEVs.
Last year, Volvo announced the EX30 would also be built in Belgium as a way to satisfy anticipated European demand for the car. But even then, Volvo said that wasn't set to begin until 2025; it seems that the U.S. is going to have to wait until then.
As I wrote for InsideEVs earlier this month, Americans who put down a $500 reservation for the EX30 (which, in the interest of full disclosure, included me as well until recently) often faced ""radio silence"" from their dealers when seeking information about the status of their orders. Many reservation-holders became concerned about the car's pricing after the new tariffs were announced. But Volvo says reservation holders won't be left hanging.
""We’ll offer customers with existing preorders several options to drive a new Volvo until their EX30 arrives,"" the spokesperson said via email.
The chairman of Volvo's Retail Advisory Board—a group that coordinates with Volvo on the needs of U.S. dealers—told InsideEVs that Volvo indicated it would sell the car here eventually.
When, and perhaps if, the EX30 does arrive, it will compete against a new crop of more affordable electric models, including the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV and the new Kia EV3. But it now may not be able to match those cars in price, and whatever head start it could've had is now a victim of the tariffs. It's a good reminder that, in the EV era, local production is more important now than ever before.
""The EX30 remains a cornerstone of Volvo Cars’ ongoing strategic transformation and reflects our ambition to build cars where we sell them as much as possible,"" the Volvo spokesperson said.

2025 BMW M5 Has Up To 25 Miles Of Electric Range And A Big Weight Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/724420/2025-bmw-m5-phev-range-weight-specs/,"Despite being more powerful than before, the first-ever plug-in hybrid BMW M5 is slower to 60 mph than its predecessor.",6/25/2024 18:01,"The BMW M5, historically one of the best-handling and thrilling sports sedans in the world, has officially gone down the plug-in hybrid route for its seventh generation. Sporting a burbling 4.4-liter V-8 under the hood, an electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission and a 14.8-kilowatt-hour (usable) high-voltage battery, the 2025 BMW M5 boasts an impressive spec sheet and a price tag to match.
Coming to the United States later this year, the brand-new German uber-sedan promises an “unfiltered performance experience,” but we can’t help but notice that even with all the weight savings mentioned in the official press release–like a plastic oil pan, among other things–the 2025 M5 is still a whopping 1,000 pounds heavier than the previous generation.
2025 BMW M5 specs
Tipping the scales at a generous 5,390 pounds, the seventh-gen BMW M5 has a total system output of 717 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque. This makes it 117 hp more powerful and 185 lb-ft more torquey than its predecessor but despite this, the zero to 60 miles per hour time is 3.4 seconds, two-tenths of a second slower than the old one.

More powerful, faster versions of the PHEV M5 will almost certainly take to the streets in the coming years, but as it stands right now, it’s not looking too cool for sports sedan enthusiasts.
Combustion lovers might also be unimpressed with the power output of the V-8 unit sitting under the hood. Making 577 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque without assistance from the electric motor, the S68 lump is 23 hp down on power compared to its predecessor, while the torque figure is the same.
Moving on to more electrifying stuff, that 14.8-kWh battery pack bolted into the floor provides up to 25 miles of all-electric range and can be topped up using a Level 2 charger at a rate of up to 7.4 kW, according to BMW. It can also be charged while driving using the eControl driving mode. Meanwhile, the car defaults to the Hybrid mode every time you start it, giving access to the full system output. Switching to Comfort mode instructs the PHEV system to call on the electric motor more often, while the Electric mode switches off the V-8 completely, as long as there’s enough juice in the battery to propel the car.
Two additional driving modes, Dynamic and Dynamic Plus, come as part of the optional M Drive Professional pack and are aimed at more hardcore driving. When activated, either of the two modes keeps both the combustion engine and electric motor engaged and preconditions the cooling system for track driving. Another optional extra, the M Driver's pack also ups the top speed from the standard 155 mph to 190 mph.
As with the previous generation, the new M5 has an all-wheel drive system called M xDrive that can become a rear-wheel drive setup at the flick of a switch for some tire-shredding fun. The new 2025 BMW M5 also comes with a double-wishbone front suspension and a five-link rear axle, as well as adaptive suspension and four-wheel steering as standard.
Braking is handled by the M Compound setup as standard, which includes 16.1-inch rotors and six-piston calipers at the front and 15.7-inch rotors and single-piston calipers at the rear. As an optional extra, customers can spec the car with the M Carbon ceramic brakes which are around 55 lbs lighter than the standard affair and come with gold calipers and larger 16.5-inch drilled discs at the front.
Compared to the standard 5 Series, the 2025 BMW M5 is 3 inches wider at the front and 1.9 inches at the rear thanks to the wider track and flared wheel arches that were designed specifically for the go-fast 5 Series.
Inside, the high-performance German sedan comes with a long list of standard equipment including a Bowers & Wilkins surround sound system, Sky Lounge panoramic roof, curved dual dashboard display, head-up display, eSIM connectivity and more.
The 2025 BMW M5 will start at $120,675 (including destination) in the United States. Production will begin in July at BMW’s plant in Dingolfing, Germany, with global deliveries slated for November.",Iulian Dnistran
The Electric BMW M3 Will 'Beat Everything',https://www.motor1.com/news/724126/electric-bmw-m3-beat-everything/,BMW M CEO Frank van Meel is eager to take advantage of the sedan's quad-motor setup.,12/25/2024 9:03,"While some automakers are changing their EV plans, BMW is marching ahead. The company will launch models using its Neue Klasse platform in a few years, including its high-performance M cars. Those worried about the move to electrification should feel some relief from BMW M CEO Frank van Meel, who claimed that the electric M3 will ""beat everything.""
He told Motor Trend that he is eager to take advantage of the car's quad-motor configuration due to the ability to control the drivetrain and the chassis ""with one central logic,"" creating a ""neutral, linear, and predictable"" performance car that should have the power to, well, beat everything.
BMW Neue Klasse EV Concept
Frank Weber, BMW's head of engineering and R&D, has already hinted at the car making one megawatt of power, or 1,341 horsepower. The M car will feature unique battery chemistry and cooling, in-house designed e-motors, an 800-volt architecture, and special software to run it all.
The automaker is also considering a lighter rear-wheel-drive variant that offers a different driving experience. Half the motors likely mean half the power and 670 hp is still a lot. We might also get an electric M3 Touring riding on the new architecture, but all the fun stuff is still a few years away. The Neue Klasse-based 3 Series arrives in 2026, followed by the M3 in 2027. The wagon would likely come after that, closer to the decade's end.
How much will this super-machine cost? We don't know, but we hope the price doesn't also beat everything we have ever seen. Bold cars backed by bold claims often come with equally bold price tags

2026 Bugatti Tourbillon: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/723757/2026-bugatti-tourbillion-debut-specs/,"It has 16 cylinders, 3 electric motors, and a top speed of 276 miles per hour.",12/25/2024 9:03,"This is not another Bugatti Chiron derivative. There's certainly a striking resemblance to the old W-16-powered hypercar, but this a completely new beast. The monocoque is new. The suspension is new. And the hybrid V-16 powertrain is most definitely new. Say hello to Bugatti's next-generation 1,800-horsepower flagship, the Tourbillon.
The previous reports about the engine were true—this is an 8.3-liter monster that revs to 9,500 RPM and makes 1,000 horsepower without any turbochargers. Cosworth helped develop the naturally aspirated beast, which weighs just 555 pounds despite being significantly larger than the W-16 it replaces. There's also 664 pound-feet of torque, but of greater interest here is the other half of the Tourbillon's powertrain.
We're talking about the hybrid assistance. A front e-axle carries two electric motors, with a third motor positioned at the back to help spin the rear wheels. A 25 kWh centrally-mounted battery pack supplies power, adding 800 hp to the mix. The combined output is 1,800 hp, and provided the bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have enough grip, the Tourbillon will reach 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.0 seconds.
But that's not a proper metric to convey the Tourbillon's true performance. Under full throttle, 124 mph is reached in around 5.0 seconds. 186 mph arrives in a mere 10 seconds. The top speed of 236 mph happens in less than 25 seconds, unless you have the special Speed Key installed. When activated, the Tourbillon keeps its ginormous rear wing hunkered down while the speed climbs all the way to 276 mph.
The latest Bugatti doesn't lose anything in becoming a hybrid, except a little bit of weight. Yes, despite a battery pack and electric motors, Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron. It can also cruise around town without using that snazzy V-16 engine. Actually, it can go beyond town with an estimated EV range of 37 miles. There's no mention of speed on electric power, and Bugatti isn't ready to talk about charging times. But it uses an 800-volt system, and lest we forget, Mate Rimac is steering Bugatti these days. And he knows a thing or two about electric performance.
Watch connoisseurs will recognize tourbillon as mechanical bits used in high-quality timepieces to increase accuracy. Bugatti sees its Tourbillon as a big, timeless work of mechanical perfection. That becomes readily apparent when you open the electrically actuated dihedral doors to see the stunning analog interior. Three large dials affixed to the steering wheel display everything from speed to engine revs, fuel quantity, engine temperature, and more. There isn't a screen in sight.
The gauges were designed and crafted by Switch watchmakers, and they're permanently fixed to the steering column so they remain stationary as you turn the wheel. Meanwhile in the center console, you'll find banks of aluminum switches, rotary dials, and a single crystal lever that starts the V-16. The purpose of all this is to give the Tourbillon a timeless look, but there is a hidden digital screen at the top of the center console. On command, it will rotate up and give the driver access to Apple CarPlay, among other things.
As for the design, there's no mistaking it for a Bugatti. The Chiron-esque exterior features a special diffuser that begins just behind the passenger cabin, virtually hidden from view. Vents under the headlights help funnel air to the large side intakes. The horseshoe grille feeds air to radiators while also augmenting downforce. The active rear wing can deploy upward to serve as an airbrake. And it all rides on a completely new multi-link suspension that is 45 percent lighter compared to the Chiron's bones.
""The development of the Bugatti Tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of Bugatti history and the words of Ettore Bugatti himself,"" said Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac. ""His mantras ‘if comparable it is no longer Bugatti’ and ‘nothing is too beautiful’ were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the Bugatti hyper sports car story.""
Though we're seeing the car today, that era won't begin until 2026 when the first of 250 production cars will be delivered. Right now, the Tourbillon is currently in its testing phase, so start saving those pennies. You'll need every single one, because the Tourbillon's starting price is 3.6 million Euros (around $3.9 million at current exchange rates).

"2025 Audi E-Tron GT Is The Fastest, Most Powerful Stock Audi Ever",https://insideevs.com/news/723716/2025-audi-e-tron-specs/,The newly-added RS E-Tron GT Performance version boasts an impressive 912 horsepower.,6/18/2024 9:19,"The all-electric Audi E-Tron GT is faster, more powerful, can drive further, and can charge faster than ever, thanks to the long list of improvements brought by its first facelift. The German automaker now offers three versions of its sleek battery-powered grand tourer: S E-Tron GT, RS E-Tron GT and a newly-added RS E-Tron GT Performance.
Expected to arrive in the United States later this year as a 2025 model, the range-topping Audi RS E-Tron GT Performance boasts a rather healthy maximum power output of 912 horsepower courtesy of two electric motors, enough to propel the EV from standstill to 62 miles per hour in just two and a half seconds.
Comprehensive mid-cycle refresh
Just like its Porsche-branded Taycan cousin, the all-electric Audi E-Tron GT got a comprehensive update three years after its introduction. The refresh brings a bigger battery, faster charging speeds and more power, all while keeping the same platform as before.
Meanwhile, the mid-tier RS E-Tron GT gets a still impressive power output of 845 hp for a 2.8-second sprint to 62 mph, while the entry-level E-Tron GT is good for 671 hp and needs 3.4 seconds to reach 62. Previously, the most powerful model–the 2024 RS E-Tron GT–was rated at 637 hp with boost engaged and could reach 60 mph in 3.1 seconds.
More Performance EVs
As with its also recently updated Porsche cousin, the Taycan, the refreshed Audi E-Tron GT gets a bigger battery and faster charging speeds.
These tweaks enable the curvy cruiser to drive further and stop for less time to recharge. The usable capacity of the lithium-ion battery went up from 84 kilowatt-hours to 97 kilowatt-hours, leading to a maximum WLTP-rated range of 378 miles for the S E-Tron GT trim.
Mind you, the EPA numbers for the refresh aren't yet available, but we know that the outgoing model has a rating of 249 miles on a full charge.
The maximum charging speed was increased from 270 kW to 320 kW, allowing the German EV to gain 174 miles of range in just 10 minutes from a compatible DC fast charger. Audi also managed to slash the weight of the battery pack and the rear electric motor by 20 pounds and 22 pounds, respectively. The maximum brake regen power has also increased from 290 to 400 kW.
The facelifted zero-emissions five-door fastback has a newly developed two-chamber, twin-valve air suspension setup that takes seconds to lower the car’s ride height by 2.1 to 3 inches to maximize comfort over bumps, even on the entry-level S version. At the same time, the range-topping RS E-Tron GT performance (which is quite a mouthful) gets a dedicated performance mode on top.
The changes inside are minimal compared to the outgoing model. Audi said the seats, steering wheel, entry sills, and digital content have been redesigned. The base S E-Tron GT comes with sports seats plus 14-way adjustment as standard, while RS models can be optionally specced with massaging seats and 18-way adjustment.
The digital instrument cluster of the range-topping RS E-Tron GT Performance comes with a white power display and speedometer that pay homage to the 1992 Audi RS2 Avant, which had its analog dials dressed in white. There’s also a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) panoramic roof available as an optional extra that can be dimmed at the push of a button.
Pricing in the U.S. isn’t available yet, but expect to pay well over $130,000 for the entry-level Audi S E-Tron GT when it arrives stateside. In Germany, the car starts at €126,000 ($135,200), while the mid-tier RS E-Tron GT goes for €147,500 ($158,200). The top-trim RS E-Tron GT Performance starts at €160,500 ($172,200).",Iulian Dnistran
Nio EL8 Is A Luxurious Six-Seater Electric SUV For Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/723524/nio-el8-debut-europe/,"It will be available in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.",6/17/2024 10:00,"Nio continues its European expansion by unveiling a new large electric SUV aimed at families. The EL8 is Nio’s flagship SUV offering in Europe, and it promises not only oodles of interior space but also advanced safety tech and performance befitting a manufacturer’s top offering. It’s also relatively slippery for a large SUV, with a claimed drag coefficient of 0.25 Cd.
Powering the EL8 is a pair of electric motors: one 241 horsepower permanent-magnet motor drives the front wheels, and a 402 hp induction motor drives the rear wheels. Their combined total output of 643 hp and 627 pound-feet of torque is enough to propel this big SUV to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds. That’s a lot of performance for a heavy SUV, and stopping power is ensured by six-piston front calipers gripping large rotors.
Nio is targeting luxury SUV buyers with the EL8
Nio expects to snag buyers away from established automakers' large electric SUVs with the EL8, which costs nearly €100,000 with the battery pack included.
With the larger 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, Nio says the EL8 should be good for a WLTP range of 317 miles. The EL8 features a 75 kWh battery as standard, which should provide about 250 miles of WLTP range.
With a total length just shy of 5.1 meters, or 201 inches, the EL8 is 24.5 centimeters, or about 10 inches longer than the smaller EL6, enough to gain a third row of seats. It is available in a six-seater configuration with or without a console and a built-in fridge between the second-row seats. All seats are electric as standard and Nio says they can gain new functions via over-the-air updates.
When the third row of seats is up, space in the trunk is limited, but their backrests can be folded electrically, increasing the maximum load volume to 810 liters, or 28.6 cubic feet. With the rear seats down, Nio says you can fit four large suitcases in the back.
The standard wheel size for the EL8 is 20 inches, but you can go up to 21 or 22 inches at an extra cost. Nio promises the vehicle will remain very quiet and comfortable thanks to standard dual-chamber air suspension, active and adaptive dampers and double-glazed windows.
The EL8 features a new 16.3-inch head-up display, 2.5 times larger than what it previously put in its vehicles. It is projected directly onto the windscreen and is complimented by a 12.8-inch portrait-style OLED central display and a smaller 10.2-inch driver’s display. Rear passengers get a 6.6-inch display. The voice-controlled digital assistant Nomi can be summoned from any of the EL8’s six seats, including from the third row.
With lidar and a total of 33 sensors and cameras on the outside, the EL8 can detect obstacles and vehicles up to 680 meters (2,230 feet) away, and it can see pedestrians at a distance of 220 meters (721 feet). Just like a Tesla, the Nio can also record what’s going on around the car when parked and also begin recording automatically in the event of an accident; you can also start recording manually, like on a traditional dash cam, if you witness something in traffic that’s worth saving.
You can get the Nio EL8 in Europe for €82,900 ($88,800) without the battery included (and you have to pay a monthly fee for the battery-as-a-service scheme), or €94,900 ($101,600) if you also want to buy the battery. It’s available in Norway, where Nio has four battery-swapping stations, and in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.",Andrei Nedelea
The New Fiat Grande Panda Proves Fun Designs Aren't Dead,https://www.motor1.com/news/723316/2025-fiat-grande-panda-debut/,It comes with a choice of hybrid or electric power.,12/25/2024 9:03,"Although Fiat's European lineup is aging, at least it's significantly more diverse than what we get here in the United States. Aside from the 500 and 500X, there's also the Tipo hatchback and wagon. There are also hot Abarth models, like the 600X crossover, and the cutesy Panda. The latter is now joined by the new Grande Panda, a larger and mechanically different vehicle.
The Grande Panda is an addition to the family rather than a replacement for the current Panda, which will stick around until at least 2027, at which point it will have been 16 years old. As the name of the newcomer implies, it’s much grander than the old car. It’s 157 inches long, making it about 12 inches longer than the third-generation Panda launched all the way back in 2011.
It's still a diminutive car by American standards but considerably more substantial than before. The jump in size is not a real surprise since the boxy crossover is essentially Fiat's version of the new Citroen C3 sold in Europe. It looks a lot funkier than its French connection, sending concept car vibes even though this is a production model.
The cheerful Fiat Grande Panda embraces the pixel motif that might make you think of a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Those front LED daytime running lights have a chequered pattern. It's a recurring theme that you'll also notice inside the taillights. The Italian brand went to town with squares and 90-degree angles, which is refreshing to see in an automotive world dominated by swoopy designs and curvy lines.
Those 17-inch wheels with a diamond-cut design have a central ""X"" to compliment the light signature at the front and rear. Plastic cladding around the wheel arches makes the Grande Panda look more rugged, as do the chunky roof rails. Rather than using an old-fashioned badge at the back, an oversized Fiat script is debossed into the tailgate. The Panda lettering is hiding in plain sight on that black horizontal strip connecting the taillights.
The Grande Panda will be sold with hybrid and electric powertrains, presumably the same ones available for the Citroen C3. Expect a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine with three cylinders, a mild-hybrid setup, and a dual-clutch, six-speed automatic transmission. The gas is good for 100 horsepower while the electric motor provides a temporary boost of 28 hp. However, that e-motor only delivers 12 hp during acceleration.
The fully electric Grande Panda might inherit the 113-hp motor from the e-C3, along with its 44.0-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for a 199-mile range. Citroen also intends to sell a cheaper 124-mile e-C3 from 2025.
The Grande Panda won’t be a Euro-only affair as Fiat wants to sell the new model in the Middle East and Africa as well.

"Jeep's $25,000 EV Will Be The Next Renegade",https://insideevs.com/news/723241/jeepr-renegade-ev-25k-news/,"Jeep has given a name to its upcoming affordable electric car, and it's a familiar one.",6/13/2024 12:58,"The entire auto industry is chasing more affordable electric vehicles. They need to move electric power to a new class of buyer, they're freaked out by the incursion of China's advanced EVs and they have tough fuel economy average targets to meet. Even Jeep is no exception. And so today, we got some news about Jeep's upcoming $25,000 electric model, including the fact that it carries a familiar name.
Jeep's new $25,000 EV will be the next Jeep Renegade, according to a presentation at parent company Stellantis' annual Investor Day event. That move brings fully electric power to a compact but still off-road-capable crossover that's been around since 2014, and also currently exists as a 4xe plug-in hybrid in some markets.
The race for a $25,000 EV
Ford, Tesla, Jeep, General Motors and several others are all racing to get out an EV that may start around $25,000. They need to cut costs, get manufacturing scale up and seek a new kind of buyer. Which automaker gets there first is an open question.
Beyond the announcement of the new name, few details were offered today, except to say that Jeep seems to be targeting a 2027 release date for the next Renegade. In the meantime, the automaker has several more plug-in hybrid, fully electric and range-extender models in the pipeline. Like those models, the Renegade is planned for North America.
At the same time, it's worth noting that while Stellantis is often quite thorough in announcing its upcoming product lineup plans, those plans can change. (Anyone remember when Alfa Romeo was supposed to have this monster new lineup of sedans and SUVs?) But these plans do fit with what the automaking giant has been planning over the past few years, which is to offer a wide variety of powertrains—hybrid, gas, electric, PHEV and range-extended EVs—to suit different market needs and conditions.
First up on the electric front will be the new Jeep Wagoneer S, which arrives this fall with a planned 300 miles of range. That car's Launch Edition model is expected to cost a hefty $71,995. But the second half of this decade will be when a number of more affordable EVs are expected to come to market, so if Jeep delivers on the Renegade at around $25,000, it's going to be in good company.

Ford Cancels Model e Dealership Program And Set EV Pricing Model,https://insideevs.com/news/723205/ford-cancels-modele-dealership-program/,The bold attempt to separate EV sales from combustion sales proved too difficult a task to accomplish.,6/13/2024 9:15,"Ford announced today that it is sunsetting its Model E dealer certification program, effective July 1. The program was announced on September 14th, 2022, and officially began on Jan. 1 of this year. While the automaker's goal was to better compete with EV startups by requiring dealers to invest in charging stations, training, customer education and no-haggle pricing before they could sell EVs, Ford's dealers went full-throttle in their opposition to it—and even filed lawsuits over the plan.
InsideEVs was on hand when Ford announced the program at its dealership meetings in Las Vegas in 2022. At the time, it told its dealer network they had to invest in EV charging infrastructure, improve customer service, and agree to set EV pricing if they wanted to be a Model e dealership and continue to sell Ford's electric vehicles.
At the time, Ford split the company into three arms: Ford Blue Oval, Ford Pro, and Ford Model e. All of Ford's fully electric vehicles fell under the Model e umbrella, while plug-in hybrids and regular hybrids are part of Ford Blue Oval.
Ford dealers would be unable to sell fully electric vehicles unless they agreed to one of the two certification levels.
That's no longer the case. All Ford dealerships can sell electric vehicles beginning July 1.
Ford Lightning Pro
Ford gave its dealers until Oct. 31, 2022, less than two months after the announcement, to make a decision that would have huge implications for the franchise's future.
That deadline was extended to Dec. 2, as many dealers complained that six weeks wasn't enough time for such a major decision. The company offered its dealers three options:
Of the 1,920 franchises that agreed to become Model e dealers, initially, 1,659 chose to be Certified Elite with full sales and service capability. Another 261 dealers chose to be Certified with full-service capability, limited sales, and a lower investment cost.
Related News
I was told today that about 1,500 dealers are Model e-certified dealerships, so about 400 of the initial hand-raisers decided against the Model e business model.
Dealers that opted out entirely would have the opportunity to tell Ford they wanted to be a Model e certified dealer in 2025, and start selling EVs on Jan. 1, 2027, after three years without getting any electric vehicles to sell.
Ford Mustang Mach-E Green
Model e Certified Elite dealers were required to install two high-powered DC fast chargers, one level 2 charging station, and one DC fast charger had to be made available for public use.
Model e Certified dealers were only required to install one DC fast charger, which had to be available for the public. Initially, Certified dealers had a hard cap on the number of EVs they were allowed to sell each year, but Ford later removed that cap under intense pushback from its dealers.
Model e dealers were also required to post set prices for electric vehicles online on Ford's main website, not the dealer's website. Customers could then view the set pricing, complete the purchase online, and even schedule home delivery. However, the dealerships set the prices, not Ford, so there would likely be price variation from dealer to dealer.
Customers could then cross-shop different local dealers' prices online and choose the one with the lowest set price. The dealers had to honor the set pricing for every purchase, and Ford said it would be checking the purchase orders to ensure the set pricing was honored.
The dealers also had to undergo special training and offer service, including a drop-off/pick-up service.
2024 Ford F-150 Lightning Flash
With today's announcement, the entire program is scrapped, or ""sunsetted"" as Ford put it. It's unfortunate, because ultimately the program would have made Ford dealerships better, and set Ford up to be more competitive as the industry transitions to electric.
I asked Marin Gjaja, COO of Ford Model e, if the decision to end the program only six months after it officially began was because of the intense pushback and lawsuits from dealership associations across the country. I was told that wasn't the case, but it's hard to believe that didn't play a major role in the decision to pull the plug.
I can't help but see this as a major missed opportunity for Ford and its dealers. Consumers aren't happy with the current dealership model, and Ford was trying to improve that while toeing the line of the archaic but strong dealership laws in the U.S.
Everyone loses here. The dealers may think they won, but they didn't. Short-term gains will be overwhelmed by long-term losses as consumers look to EV startups that work around the dealership laws and offer a set pricing model. That will eventually erode Ford's EV market share as consumers seek a better purchasing experience and the security of knowing they can pull into any Ford dealership and charge up when needed.",Tom Moloughney
Subaru Explains How Its New Hybrid Boxer Engine is Better,https://www.motor1.com/news/722335/subaru-details-new-hybrid-engine/,Production of the next-gen hybrid powertrain starts this fall.,12/25/2024 9:03,"Some automakers are trying to save the manuals while others are attempting to rescue the internal combustion engine. Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru held a joint conference to explain how decarbonization can be achieved without going all-in on EVs. Toyota has three new smaller and more efficient engines in the works. Mazda is pursuing single- and two-rotor engines. Here's what Subaru is cooking up.
It has figured out how to keep its horizontally opposed engine alive in a next-generation hybrid system. During the conference, the company showed a prototype of its electrified boxer inside a camouflaged Crosstrek prototype. The outgoing setup relies on a parallel system where the engine and motor both power the vehicle. The new series-parallel layout will maintain a mechanical connection between the ICE and the wheels but the combustion engine will also serve as a generator to feed a battery that powers an electric motor.
Next-generation Subaru hybrid boxer engine
Subaru argues the new hardware brings notable benefits not just in terms of fuel economy but also in packaging. The engine, hybrid system, transmission, and transfer case are all housed together while the power control unit is located in the engine bay, without negatively impacting the size of the fuel tank. That allows the engineers to install bigger gas tanks to achieve a longer range.
In the old Crosstrek hybrid, the power control unit was mounted at the rear, so the fuel tank had to be downsized to make room for it. Thanks to the new arrangement, Subaru claims the fuel tank's size will be almost the same in the hybrid as in the regular gas-only model. Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Fujinuki touts a ""very long cruising distance."" During his speech, he said the new system must solve the ""current weakness in fuel efficiency.""
The company's CTO admits that if fuel economy is the ultimate goal, the boxer engine might not represent the ideal solution:
""If you were just going for efficiency, horizontally opposed engines are not necessarily always the best option. But what would Subaru be without them? When you think about it, we are the only mass-market brand making horizontally opposed engines today.""
Toyota also uses a boxer engine but only in the GR86 sports car, which is a sister model of the Subaru BRZ. Porsche has flat-four and flat-six engines but it's far from being a mainstream brand given how much their cars cost.
Subaru plans to start production of its next-gen hybrid boxer engine this fall at a factory in Kitamoto, Saitama at home in Japan. As you can imagine, the hardware is being conceived for all-wheel-drive applications.
Subaru High Performance X Future Concept
In related news, the company is working together with Toyota and Mazda on carbon-neutral fuels. To that end, it'll enter a WRX-based High Performance X Future Concept in the Super Taikyu racing series.
Since we mentioned Mazda earlier, the Zoom-Zoom company is doing things differently with the revival of its rotary. In the MX-30 small crossover, the engine doesn't actually send power to the wheels. Instead, the sole purpose of the transversely mounted rotary is to act as a generator to juice up a battery. An electric motor uses the harvested energy to drive the wheels.
Mazda is already working on a different layout for a longitudinally mounted two-rotor engine that could go into a new sports car, potentially an RX7 reboot it's ""considering.""

"2025 Rivian R1S And R1T Get Up To 420 Miles Of Range, Huge Changes Under The Skin",https://insideevs.com/news/722131/second-gen-rivian-r1-debut/,"Rivian's R1 twins may look the same, but a ton is new here—including a new tri-motor version and upgraded software all around.",6/6/2024 12:00,"Rivian has grand plans to introduce affordable electric models next, including the R2 crossover and the R3 and R3X hatchbacks. But neither will arrive anytime soon; the R2 is not slated for release until 2026, with the R3 models expected to launch even later. In the meantime, Rivian will rely on updated versions of its original EVs, the R1T and R1S, as it works on making its future models a reality. And the big news is what's under the skin.
The second-gen Rivian R1 EVs look the same and still have the funky retro-modern vibe. But underneath there's a new electrical architecture and software platform, in-house-built drive units, and an LFP battery pack for the base version. The changes are intended to ease production challenges and reduce losses per vehicle.
And if electrical architectures and ""compute power"" don't interest you, maybe the four-motor variant getting about 200 more horsepower will instead.
Rivian R1 EVs enter a new generation.
Two years after Rivian's electric truck and SUV entered the market, the automaker has given them a thorough upgrade. Rivian lost just over $38,000 behind every EV in Q1 2024, down from $68,000 a year ago. Now, it hopes to narrow the losses further with the upgraded EVs that use simpler electrical architectures and are easier to manufacture and repair.
Rivian started moving away from the Bosch quad-motors last year to focus on its in-house Enduro drive units to improve production speed and efficiency. The second-generation R1T and R1S models will complete that transition.
The base versions will continue with the dual motor set-up, but Rivian also offers an all-new tri-motor version now. Previously, the R1 series models only came with two or four motors.
The tri-motor version gets two motors at the rear and one in the front, with a combined output of 850 horsepower, enough to propel the R1T from a standstill to 60 mph in a blistering 2.9 seconds.
The manufacturer-estimated range is about 380 miles on the tri-motor R1T using the 149 kWh Max battery pack. That can stretch up to 410 miles in Conserve mode.
Not to be outdone, the top quad motor R1 models get a performance boost, with output increasing from 835 hp and 908 pound-feet of torque to 1,025 hp and 1,198 lb-ft. That’s enough for the R1T to slingshot from 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds in Launch mode, a tenth quicker than the braggadocious Tesla Cybertruck.
Rivian claims the front two motors in the quad-motor version are compact, efficiency-focused units whereas the rear motors are engineered for performance.
The entry-level models now use lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery packs, good for 270 miles of range, the same as before. Rivian hasn’t released the exact battery capacity, but leaked certification documents shared on Rivian Forums suggest the size of the Standard pack has decreased from 105.9 kWh to 92.5 kWh.
If the battery size has decreased but the range is the same as the outgoing NMC units, then that’s saying something about how far LFP batteries have come. Typically, they aren’t as energy-dense as NMC units, but are cheaper and have a longer lifespan. That makes them suitable for entry-level models—the standard-range Tesla Model 3 and Model Y also use LFP batteries globally.
The Large and Max packs continue to use the same 2170 cylindrical cells. But the pack enclosures are now made from large high-pressure die castings to simplify manufacturing and reduce mass, according to Rivian. All that is in the interest of simpler assembly and easier serviceability.
Rivian says they deliver up to 330 miles (Large) and 420 miles (Max) of estimated range, respectively. So that would put the dual motor R1T with the Max pack between the Tesla Cybertruck AWD (340 miles) and the Chevy Silverado EV (440 miles). The dual motor R1S with the Max pack will continue to get 410 miles of range.
The tri-motor and quad-motor versions can only be had with the Max pack, Rivian confirmed to InsideEVs. On the outgoing models, the Standard+ had 121 kWh of capacity. The Large pack offered 135 kWh, while the Max battery was rated for 149 kWh.
Early R1Ts had teething issues related to software and maintenance. Owners complained about glitches on the screen, and malfunctioning driver assistance features and one owner even told InsideEVs that Rivian had to replace his R1T’s entire wiring harness just to replace a single side-view camera.
Rivian claims to have multiple fixes for such issues. There’s a new zonal electrical architecture that uses fewer more powerful ECUs, down from 17 to just seven on the second-gen models. Rivian says this has helped it remove some 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle and reduce 44 pounds of weight.
The Rivian R1T has 11 external cameras. But several Rivian owners seemed unhappy with their quality, and how they process the footage of the surroundings into the screen. The new cameras are 4K HDR units and can see three times farther and 10 seconds ahead at highway speeds.
Rivian claims these are the highest-megapixel cameras of any vehicle sold in North America—we’ll find out how they fare in the real world when we spend some time with the new models.
The second-gen R1S and R1T also feature dual Nvidia Drive Orin processors that deliver 10 times the computing performance compared to the outgoing system. The AI-powered processors use the same architectural elements as large language models (LLMs), christened “Vision Transformers” to decipher the environment around the EV and prepare reactions.
A wave of next-gen EVs, mainly Chinese, use these processors for their flagship EVs. BYD, Xpeng, Li Auto and even Lucid are using Nvidia Drive Orin as their centralized car computers as they prepare for higher levels of autonomous driving capabilities—something Nvidia claims these chips are designed for.
Rivian also says the infotainment system has been ""completely redeveloped,"" and that many of the changes to its user interface will be rolled out to first-generation R1 vehicles via an over-the-air update.
There are tons of little tweaks on the software front, including a cool addition to how the drive modes look: cel shading. This mimics the style of hand-drawn animation, with bold outlines and limited shading to create a stylized look—making them look less realistic and more cartoony. It’s something we see more commonly in video games, and as computers become more powerful, these art styles are coming back into vogue.
The more powerful chips and the fresh camera hardware should improve the performance of Rivian's suite of advanced driver assistance and safety systems. Features like Highway Assist, which can auto steer, brake and accelerate on select highways will continue to be offered on first and second-gen models.
Second-generation models will be available with a premium version of the same, called Autonomy Platform+. That will pack a broader set of skills, including Lane Change on Command (due late Summer via OTA update) and Enhanced Driver Assist that slated to arrive later this year.
Rivian also added that its EVs will continue to use a set of five radars to detect the environment around them. ""These radars serve as a vital backup to the cameras, particularly in situations where dirt or grime could obscure a camera lens,"" the automaker said.
The refreshed R1S starts at $75,900 and the R1T starts at $69,900, before taxes and fees. These are the dual-motor, Standard pack versions available to order immediately. The tri-motor R1S starts at $105,900 whereas the R1T is priced at $99,900.
They are expected to arrive by late summer whereas quad-motor is said to follow sometime later. We don’t know the prices of the quad-motor versions yet but expect detailed pricing in due course. Deliveries of the R1S start on June 7, and R1T will follow soon after.

Nissan Has Stopped Spending Money On New Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/721845/nissan-stops-combustion-engine-investments/,It's going all-in on EVs.,12/25/2024 9:03,"Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru recently announced that they're joining forces to develop next-generation combustion engines. However, another Japanese automaker has taken a radically different approach by deciding to stop investing in gasoline and diesel power altogether. Nissan says it's pretty much done spending cash on new ICE technology.
Australian magazine Drive chatted with the company's Senior Vice-President and Chief Planning Officer for the Africa, Middle East, India, Europe, and Oceania (AMIEO) region about what lies ahead. Francois Bailly was asked whether Nissan intends to develop new combustion engines: ""Our future is EV. We're not investing in new powertrain for ICE, that's for sure.""
He mentioned that the transition from conventional powered cars to fully electric models will be done through Nissan's e-Power technology. It's an unconventional hybrid setup where the combustion engine acts as a generator to charge the battery. It doesn't drive the wheels, so it's similar to Mazda's rotary in the MX-30 crossover and the two-rotor setup in the Iconic SP concept.
To maximize fuel economy in these hybrid cars, Nissan wants to boost the thermal efficiency of a combustion engine to an impressive 50 percent. It's been working on the tech for several years, announcing in early 2021 that a prototype e-Power achieved the milestone during testing. It's worth noting that Toyota's Dynamic Force lineup of three-, four-, and six-cylinder engines has already surpassed 40 percent.
Just because Nissan is no longer pouring money into all-new engines, it doesn't mean the switch to an EV-only lineup will happen overnight. Bailley pointed out that emissions regulations continue to be relaxed in some parts of the world, such as in Africa where Euro 2 cars are still legal. The automaker will align its portfolio to regional requirements, so the ICE's demise will be gradual. Current engines are likely to be updated to meet stricter regulations.
Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru believe the internal combustion engine can be saved by making it run on nearly carbon-neutral fuels. The world's largest car manufacturer is working on three inline-fours while the Zoom-Zoom brand has set up a dedicated rotary team. As for Subie, it's preparing a new hybrid setup based around its signature boxer engine. Honda wants to go purely electric in all main markets (including North America) as early as 2040.

You'll find 18-inch forged wheels with Yokohama slicks under the arches, backed by six-piston brakes for the front and four-piston clamps at the rear. The suspension is upgraded with three-way adjustable dampers. Ride height and camber are also adjustable.
There's a bit more power, too. Hyundai retuned the EV powertrain to get an additional 37 horsepower from the rear motor in full overboost mode. That gives the TA Spec a total of 678 hp, but the components are still production items found in the standard Ioniq 5 N. As such, we pinged Hyundai to ask about a possible production version of the TA Spec. We've yet to hear back, but we will update the post if more news is available.
All Hyundai Ioniq 5s at Pike Peak wear a special wrap and get the necessary safety equipment to participate. That includes upgraded external speakers capable of producing 120 decibels of sound, emitting tones produced through Hyundai's N Active Sound+ system. Aside from the safety requirement of EVs emitting sound while racing, Hyundai states the engine sound will enhance driver feedback.
In addition to the race-prepped models. Hyundai will campaign two production-spec Ioniq 5 Ns with an eye on getting a production EV record. The only changes from stock are safety-related with roll cages and gear necessary to compete. And for the gamers out there, Hyundai is working with the Gran Turismo franchise on upcoming hill climb action in GT7. More details on that endeavor will come later.
“We are investing in the future of motorsport with our first ever electric Pikes Peak racer and collaboration with Gran Turismo,"" said Till Wartenberg, vice president and head of N Brand at Hyundai. ""Motorsport passion continues to be at Hyundai N’s core as we move into the future.""

2024 Jeep Wagoneer S: A 300-Mile EV With Tons Of Speed,https://insideevs.com/news/721484/2024-jeep-wagoneer-s-debut-specs-battery-charging-official/,"Jeep's first global EV launches with a big battery, off-road tricks, an aerodynamic design and quicker 0-60 mph times than a Trackhawk.",5/30/2024 19:00,"Technically, the first all-electric Jeep model was the Jeep Avenger. But as a subcompact crossover that only recently added all-wheel-drive, there's a reason it's only sold in Europe and a few other markets. No, the ""real"" battery-powered Jeep that Americans—and soon, much of the rest of the world—will want is this: the 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S.
Set to be assembled in Mexico, the Wagoneer S will first go on sale in the U.S. and Canada this fall, followed by other markets worldwide. The first version available, called Launch Edition, comes with all the bells and whistles and carries a starting price of $71,995 including destination.
Powered by a 100.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack and packing 20-inch wheels, 45 inches of usable screen real estate inside and plenty of ambient lighting, the Launch Edition is as loaded as this model gets. But more affordable variants are coming soon, as are more electric members of the Jeep family as well.
Jeep's EV offensive starts
The Wagoneer S is Jeep's first global EV. Featuring 600 horsepower, dual-motor all-wheel drive and an estimated range of over 300 miles thanks to a massive 100.5-kWh battery, the Wagoneer S looks like a very promising vehicle. That said, the $70,000+ price tag for the Launch Edition makes it $20,000 more expensive than the top-spec Tesla Model Y Performance, so dealers will need to do a lot of convincing work to sell high volumes.
By comparison, a top-spec Tesla Model Y Performance—something the Wagoneer S is already racing against in new ads—is roughly $20,000 less. But Jeep says the all-new Wagoneer S is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit both when purchasing and leasing and more affordable post-Launch Edition versions are likely to follow.
Size-wise, it's also quite a bit bigger than the Model Y. Measuring 192.4 inches long, 74.8 inches wide (without mirrors) and 64.8 inches tall, the Wagoneer S is roughly similar to the Chevrolet Blazer EV, albeit a bit wider. But this isn't just some midsize crossover; it's a Jeep, so it comes standard with dual-motor all-wheel drive.

Billed as Jeep’s most aerodynamic car ever, with a drag coefficient of 0.29, the all-new Wagoneer S is based on Stellantis’ STLA Large platform and uses a 400-volt architecture. Each of the two electric drive motors fitted on the front and rear axles integrate the electric motor, gearing and power electronics into a single unit. Each motor makes 250 kW (335 horsepower), while the total system output is rated at 447 kW (600 hp) and 617 pound-feet of torque.
The front EDM features wheel disconnects to reduce energy consumption when cruising and optimize range. In other words, the Wagoneer S can sometimes run as a rear-wheel drive vehicle.
Jeep says the zero to 60 miles per hour time of the Wagoneer S Launch Edition is 3.4 seconds and the top speed is 124 mph, making it the fastest Jeep ever. Yes, even faster than the Jeep Trackhawk, which could only manage to do it in 3.5 seconds.
Charging the new EV from 5% to 80% from a Level 2 charger takes approximately 6.8 hours, according to Jeep, and the Launch Edition will come with either a 48-amp Level 2 home charger or public charging credits through Free2move Charge, Stellantis’ charging ecosystem.
The maximum DC fast charging rate hasn’t been disclosed, but the company said that a 20% to 80% top-up will take around 23 minutes, adding 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. The official press release didn’t mention anything about vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability, so it’s unclear if Jeep’s new global electric SUV will offer this functionality. The CCS port is located on the rear left quarter panel; Jeep officials said today that they will offer Tesla's NACS port on this model sometime in the next two years.
Jeep’s EV has a curb weight of 5,667 pounds and a payload capacity of 1,033 pounds, while the maximum trailering capacity is 3,400 pounds. The trunk has a volume of 30.6 cubic feet and the front trunk can carry three cubic feet of stuff, while the whole vehicle boasts 61 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down.
The American carmaker says the Wagoneer S has a body torsion stiffness 35% higher than the company’s previous mid-size crossover, which translates to a “superior ride, handling and effective response to driver input.”
And as a Jeep, it shouldn't be a slouch off-road, either. The Wagoneer S boasts five driving modes for different types of terrain, including snow and sand.
Billed as a stylish, sophisticated and confident machine, the new battery-powered Jeep features a stylized closed seven-slot grille that illuminates the line of sight when the driver approaches the car.
The angled hood and windshield help with the EV’s aerodynamics, as do the cantilevered rear spoiler, flush pocket door handles, integrated fins and underbody shields.
The Launch Edition comes with dark accent cues all around the exterior, including 20-inch Gloss Black wheels. There’s also a dual-pane panoramic sunroof and satin-painted accent trims.
Step inside and the biggest attraction is the massive screen real estate. Jeep says the 2024 Wagoneer S has over 45 inches of usable screen space that comes from four separate displays: a 12.3-inch instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch center infotainment system running the company’s Uconnect 5 system, a 10.25-inch segment-exclusive passenger display and another touchscreen at the bottom of the center console for the climate control system. There’s no display for the rear passengers.
The seating, center console, doors and instrument panel are covered in a non-leather synthetic material. The headliner is made from premium microfiber suede and the premium carpets are comprised of recycled pre- and post-consumer materials.
Up front, the Wagoneer S’s cockpit is adorned with black ceramic-coated aluminum with haptic applique. The soft-wrapped doors are accentuated with decorative trim and the flat-bottomed steering wheel is covered in a red-stitched Cabo vinyl anti-microbial material that makes it easier to clean, according to Jeep.
Jeep says it's the only model in its segment to have standard heated and exclusive standard ventilated rear seats. The front seats are also heated and ventilated.
The Launch Edition comes with a segment-exclusive McIntosh premium sound system that packs 19 speakers, a 1,200-watt amplifier and a 12-inch subwoofer. The Wagoneer S also features over-the-air software updates and over 170 safety and security features, according to Jeep, including Active Driving Assist, Intersection Collision Assist, Drowsy Driver Detection, Traffic Sign Recognition and Surround View camera.

2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Trailhawk Concept: Rock-Crawling Goes Electric,https://insideevs.com/news/721595/jeep-wagoneer-s-trailhawk-concept/,Jeep's new midsize electric SUV is probably getting an off-road variant soon.,5/30/2024 19:00,"Clearly, Jeep isn't about to let Rivian have all of the fun when it comes to no-gas adventures away from the pavement. Meet the Jeep Wagoneer S Trailhawk Concept, unveiled today in New York City (where the potholes often necessitate an off-road suspension) alongside the standard Wagoneer S. And while Jeep is just calling it a concept for now, it seems almost assuredly destined for production.
After all, this makes sense. With off-roading being such a key part of Jeep's DNA, from the Rubicon Trail to Moab and beyond, leaving its first global all-electric vehicle without a dedicated go-anywhere version would almost feel like an oversight.
As a result, the Wagoneer S Trailhawk—if it's put into production—will add 31.5-inch all-terrain tires, heavy-duty tow hooks, air extractors, an interior with more rugged touches and a lot of exterior tweaks to show that this won't be just another mall-cruiser.
""Not too long after we completed the Jeep Wagoneer S the same designers sketching 'what if', and 'what if' is pretty easy when you're Jeep,"" said Ralph Gilles, the Chief Design Officer of Stellantis. ""You take all those formulas that we know very well that make a Jeep, a Jeep.""
Presumably, the Trailhawk is powered by the same 100.5-kWh battery pack as the normal Wagoneer S, though I have no doubt those big tires and roof rack will cut into the EV's impressive 300 miles of range. But this version may trade some of that for a dedicated Rock mode and a driver-selectable electronic rear axle locker. It has a lifted suspension good for adding three inches of ground clearance, and the front fascia was also redesigned for a better approach angle. ""We think with those changes, it's going to give it some incredible performance,"" Gilles said.
No other specs were released about the Trailhawk version today, but Gilles left it as a kind of open question to the crowd and the wider Jeep fandom as to whether it should be greenlit or not.
""I think we want to make this car,"" he said. ""So we want to hear what you think after this."" Should Jeep go for it? Let us know in the comments.

"$25,000 Electric Jeep Is Coming Soon, Says Stellantis CEO",https://insideevs.com/news/721531/cheap-jeep-ev-coming-soon/,A cheap Jeep that's electric? Consider us intrigued.,5/30/2024 10:00,"Stellantis might have been slow to adopt EVs in the U.S., with the new Fiat 500e being sold here about four years after it was first shown. In Europe, however, the brand-heavy automaker is an electric leader thanks to a wide EV lineup from brands such as Peugeot, Citroen, and DS. Now, its North American lineup could soon benefit from that—in the form of a Jeep.
According to CNBC, the U.S. “will have a $25,000 Jeep very soon,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said Wednesday at a Bernstein investor conference. Tavares sees 20,000 euros, or about $25,000 USD, as the target price for an entry-level EV that could be more widely adopted than a luxury model.
That viewpoint follows the Jeep Wagoneer S, which will be revealed Thursday evening and has a target range of more than 300 miles and 600 horsepower.
An inexpensive Jeep EV could have a lot in common with the recently launched Citroen e-C3, an all-electric five-door about the size of the last Honda Fit to be sold in the U.S. It uses a 111 horsepower, 44 kWh electric motor and has a roughly 200-mile range based on WLTP, equating to somewhere between 175 and 180 miles for an EPA estimate. Such a vehicle would likely be a jumping-off point for a Jeep that would unlikely traverse anything more than a muddy parking lot.

The Jeep Avenger is another EV not sold in the U.S., and Stellantis still isn’t expected to offer that small SUV here anytime soon. The Poland-assembled model uses a platform not shared with any model sold in the U.S. or Canada and could be more expensive than potential rivals.
While Stellantis has a growing roster of plug-in hybrids, including the popular Jeep Wrangler 4xe, it’s been mostly mum on its EV plans apart from the trio of upcoming electric Jeeps like the Wrangler S. It turned out to be an advantage with direct rivals Ford and General Motors scrambling to alter product plans and add PHEVs amid lagging public charging infrastructure and new car cost concerns. Even the 149-mile Fiat 500e, by the company’s admission, is a niche product and not the start of a big push for Stellantis BEVs in the U.S.
A $25,000 Jeep EV in the U.S. could make significant waves as sub-$40,000 EVs dwindle and popular, inexpensive models like the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf take a leave of absence. Still, Stellantis continues to lean pretty hard on the Jeep brand globally. Would an inexpensive EV fit a brand like Fiat or Dodge better?
There’s probably still time to figure that out.",Zac Estrada
"Fiat Reverses Course, Puts Gas Engine Back Into 500",https://www.motor1.com/news/721323/fiat-500-gas-engine-2026/,The latest 500 is purely electric but Fiat will install a combustion engine from 2026.,12/25/2024 9:03,"The rumors were true. Fiat has confirmed the latest 500 will get a combustion engine after all. Despite being launched strictly as an electric city car with no word of an ICE variant, the hatchback will get gasoline power. Parent company Stellantis has announced a hybrid 500 will be made at the Mirafiori factory in Italy beginning in 2026.
To be fair, the 500 technically never lost its combustion engine; Fiat still sells the previous-generation model outside the United States as a hybrid. In North America, the pint-sized car is strictly electric. It's too soon to say whether the ICE model will make its way to the US where it would definitely be cheaper than the pricey EV. The 2024 500e costs $34,095 before options.
It's obvious that the EV market's cooldown is forcing automakers to alter plans. Many assumed electric vehicles would replace ICE models sooner or later, but with EV incentives being gradually reduced and even eliminated in some cases, people are reconsidering their options.
With the new 500 getting a gas engine, it'll be interesting to see whether the high-performance Abarth 500e will also be joined by a hybrid model. As with the Fiat-badged, previous-generation model, Abarth still sells the sporty 500 with a conventional engine.
Several years ago, Fiat announced it would go purely electric by the end of the decade. However, it's unclear whether that's still happening. Other brands have also pushed back their EV-only ambitions beyond 2030, with the most recent example being Ford of Europe.
In related news, Stellantis also intends to build a hybrid version of the Jeep Compass at the Melfi plant in Italy. No further details were released but we're hoping it'll be based on the third-generation model. The current crossover has been around since 2016, so it's getting a bit long in the tooth.
Speaking of old cars sticking around, the Italian automaker isn't ruling out selling the Panda until 2029, at which point it will have been 18 years old. It would peacefully coexist with the next-gen model slated to debut on July 11 to mark 125 years of Fiat.

"2025 Cadillac Optiq Has 300 Miles Of Range And Starts At $54,000",https://insideevs.com/news/721166/2025-cadillac-optiq-range-specs-official/,"Cadillac’s most affordable EV comes with plenty of standard features, including all-wheel drive and Super Cruise.",5/29/2024 12:00,"The 2025 Cadillac Optiq is finally here as the American luxury automaker’s new entry-level all-electric crossover. It will go into production this fall, and when it reaches dealerships toward the end of the year, it will have an estimated starting price of $54,000, including destination.
The Optiq is the Lyriq’s smaller brother. It is based on the same BEV3 architecture that underpins the new Chevrolet Equinox EV. It seats five and comes with a healthy list of standard features.
GM's Ultium plans gain steam
After several delays, General Motors' plan to electrify its range using the Ultium platform is finally heading in the right direction. Following several launches of cars that cost well over $70,000, the Ultium tech is trickling down to more affordable models.
In the United States, Cadillac's new electric crossover has a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain that makes 300 horsepower (224 kilowatts) and 354 pound-feet of torque. The only battery available is an 85-kilowatt-hour unit that packs 10 lithium-ion modules, enabling a General Motors-estimated driving range of 300 miles on a full charge. The EPA rating is not yet available.
More Cadillac Stories
When plugged into a 7.7 kW AC source, the Optiq’s range increases at 24 miles per hour. From an 11.5 kW AC source, that figure goes up to 33 miles per hour, while the optional 19.2 kW AC charger can add up to 55 miles of range per hour.
A DC fast charger adds up to 79 miles of range in 10 minutes to the Optiq, which can accept a maximum of 150 kW from a compatible stall. The mechanically similar Chevrolet Equinox EV can also take up to 150 kW, while the larger Cadillac Lyriq ups that figure to 190 kW.
The new Optiq will be equipped from the factory with a CCS1 charging port, and not Tesla's NACS connector. Last year, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the company’s first EV with a NACS plug would come in 2025, while access to the Supercharger network for CCS1-equipped vehicles would be enabled this spring.
The Optiq’s specs are a bit better than those of the Chinese-spec model revealed earlier this year. However, the 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time and top speed haven’t been disclosed.
Slated to be a global model–that means Europe will also get it–the new Cadillac Optiq comes as standard with three years of free Super Cruise in the U.S. That’s GM’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) that can automatically steer and change lanes on hundreds of thousands of mapped highway miles in North America.
The EV also offers Regen On Demand, which increases or decreases the force of the regenerative braking feature through a dedicated, pressure-sensitive paddle on the steering wheel. With it, the driver can slow down or stop the car without touching the brake pedal. That said, the Optiq also has a one-pedal driving feature.
2025 Cadillac Optiq interior
Measuring 190 inches long, 84 inches wide and 65 inches tall, Cadillac’s new battery-powered crossover boasts a best-in-class cargo capacity. With the second row up, the trunk has a volume of 26 cubic feet, which increases to 57 cubic feet with the second row down. According to Cadillac, the wheelbase is 116 inches–6 inches shorter than the Lyriq–enabling a segment-best second-row spaciousness. The trailering capacity is 1,500 pounds.
The entry-level luxury EV has a huge, 33-inch diagonal LED display with a 9K resolution that acts as the digital instrument cluster and infotainment screen. Adaptive cruise control, blind zone steering assist, enhanced automatic parking, forward collision alert and a 19-speaker AKG audio system with Dolby Atmos are also part of the standard pack. Google Maps and Google Assistant are baked into the infotainment system.
The car’s pattern accent fabric is woven from yarn made from 100% recycled materials, while the so-called PaperWood veneer is equal parts tulip wood and recycled newspaper.

Volkswagen And Renault Won't Build An Affordable EV Together,https://www.motor1.com/news/720684/renault-volkswagen-failed-ev-collaboration/,"The Twingo is still happening, just not with VW's help.",12/25/2024 9:03,"Facing an influx of cheap electric cars from China, European automakers have legitimate reasons to worry. Renault wanted to create an alliance with Volkswagen to better compete with imports but to no avail. A jointly developed EV with a low starting price is not happening. Speaking with Reuters, Renault CEO Luca de Meo said the talks between the two parties have ended.
The French company's head honcho calls it a ""lost opportunity,"" but he suggests that Renault is still open to collaborating with other car manufacturers: ""There may be others."" VW refused to comment, but the two major automakers have officially parted ways. Meanwhile, Renault is riding solo and still aims to have the next-gen Twingo on sale in 2026.
It's worth noting the old Twingo is still around, both with combustion engines and as an EV. The all-new city car will come exclusively in zero-emission guise and undercut the Renault 5, which is kicking off from about €25,000 ($27,000) before incentives. The new Twingo is projected to cost less than €20,000 ($21,600).
It's unclear what VW plans now that it's no longer negotiating with Renault. The Wolfsburg company could use an entry-level EV that would undercut the ID.3 and act as a replacement for the e-up! Something along the lines of an ID.1. VW technical development boss Kai Grunitz has already suggested it would be priced at under €20,000 ($21,600). He projected it would go on sale around 2027.
The battle in the entry-level EV segment is heating up, not just because of Chinese cars flooding Europe. The Dacia Spring is a roaring success, albeit that one too is technically a Chinese car. A better example is the Citroën e-C3, which costs €23,300 and is getting a base version with a lower driving range for €19,990.
In the United States, automakers largely focus on crossovers for their EV ambitions. There's the Fiat 500e and Nissan Leaf on the affordable non-SUV side, with a new Chevrolet Bolt coming next year. The new electric Mini 3-Door could also come to America as well later this decade, but only after production starts in Oxford in 2026.

The Jeep Avenger 4xe Gets Four-Wheel Drive and Lifted Suspension,https://www.motor1.com/news/720543/jeep-avenger-4xe-debut-specs/,The Jeep you can't have in the US finally has what all Jeeps should: Four-wheel drive.,12/25/2024 9:03,"It's strange to talk about a Jeep model not sold in the United States. The Avenger, a small Euro-only crossover revealed in 2022, is built at the Tychy plant in Poland alongside its sister models, the Alfa Romeo Junior and Fiat 600. It’s only been offered with front-wheel drive, but now, a new 4xe hybrid trim adds what all Jeeps should have: four-wheel drive.
At the heart of the Avenger 4xe is a tiny 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with mild-hybrid technology. It's a three-cylinder turbo mill that develops 136 horsepower and routes output to the wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Joining the ICE are two electric motors, one at the front and the other at the rear, with each developing 28 hp.
Jeep claims the new hybrid setup enables a sprint to 62 mph in nine and a half seconds and a top speed of 121 mph. At speeds of up to 19 mph, the Avenger 4xe always works in 4x4 mode with a 50:50 split between the two axles. From 19 to 56 mph, it defaults to front-wheel drive, but the rear motor is always ready to intervene should the need arise since. Go faster than 56 mph and the rear motor is disengaged to reduce fuel consumption.
The 4xe brings other benefits. The hybrid trim also gets a multi-link rear suspension and jacks up the ride height for an extra 0.4 inches of ground clearance, now at 8.26 inches. The 22-degree approach, 35-degree departure, and 21-degree breakover angles are better than those of a regular Avenger with front-wheel drive.
Jeep says the more capable variant can ford water up to about 15.75 inches deep. To sweeten the pot, there are Snow, Sand & Mud, Sport, and Auto driving modes to choose from. On top of that, customers can spend extra on the optional all-terrain tires better suited for tackling rough terrain.
Jeep has toughened up the Avenger's appearance by giving the 4xe rugged bumpers with a scratch-resistant finish. Roof rails come as standard, as does a rear tow hitch. Inside, the seats are upholstered in a waterproof material claimed to be twice as durable as before. The seats also have a special coating making it easier to remove stains and mud.
The not-for-America Jeep Avenger 4xe goes on sale in Europe late this year. It joins the already available mild-hybrid and purely electric derivatives that are both offered strictly with a front-wheel-drive setup.

"2025 Kia EV3 Revealed: Targeting $35,000 And 300-Mile Range",https://insideevs.com/news/720622/kia-ev3-global-debut-2025/,The world needs more affordable EVs for everyone. Is Kia's new EV3 the car we've been waiting for?,5/23/2024 6:00,"The people have spoken, and pretty much across the world, they want more affordable electric vehicles. They also want EVs with lots of range that can haul all of their stuff comfortably and charge up quickly so they can get back on the road without any hassles. Obviously, that's a lot to ask. But Kia may have just stepped up to the plate with an answer to almost all of those requests: the new, compact Kia EV3, which promises a high-range, affordable electric experience at last.
Not even nine months after the concept debuted at Kia's EV Day event in Korea, the nearly identical production version was unveiled today in Kia's home country. But the EV3 is going global. It's set to go on sale in Korea in July, then in Europe toward the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2025.
Kia aims to make ""EVs for all""
Though it shares hardware with corporate parent Hyundai, Kia is growing even more quickly and wants to be a dominant player in the global EV race. It's establishing battery and EV plants all over the world as it expands its lineup, which now includes the more affordable EV3.
And when it does, the specs Kia is ""targeting"" sound extremely compelling: up to 300 miles of range for the U.S. (and 560 kilometers globally) with a family price range of $35,000 to $50,000. In doing so, the EV3 could go mainstream in ways even Kia's current offerings have not yet.
More EV3 News
The EV3 ""underscores our determination to create world-leading electric vehicles that are accessible for all,"" Kia President and CEO Ho-Sung Song told journalists in a briefing this week. ""EV6 and EV9 established Kia as a key player in the global EV market, and EV3 is poised to extend EV ownership to a much broader group of customers.""
That would especially be the case with the EV3, where Kia is targeting 70,000 to 80,000 U.S. sales annually, which would put this compact EV among its top-selling cars.
Like those cars, the EV3 uses the Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP global electric car platform, but manages to be its smallest one yet. At about 169 inches (4,300 mm) in length and 61 inches (1,560 mm) tall, it's about on par size-wise with the previous Mini Countryman and smaller than the current Kia Seltos.
But that size puts it in rare company in the electric space; few modern examples of EVs exist at this size outside of China, and certainly not with such promising specs. And that size and price don't mean it's some bargain basement, rental-grade penalty box; with vehicle-to-load (V2L) technology that can charge various devices and a new ChatGPT-based AI assistant set to roll out on other Kia models, it could rewrite what we expect from small, affordable cars.
Kia says the EV3 will come with two battery packs available: a 58.3 kWh unit for the Base model, and an 81.4 kWh one for the Long Range model. The former is the same size as the one used on the entry-level, rear-wheel drive Kia EV6 Light. The latter is almost as large as the biggest pack in the updated EV6, an 84 kWh unit. In other words, this small car is packing a serious battery, especially in top form.
Both models use a 150 kW (aka 202 horsepower) motor to drive the front wheels. The zero to 60 mph time is said to be 7.5 seconds.
However, the EV3 uses a more cost-effective 400-volt electric architecture than the 800V one in the more expensive EV6 and other Hyundai and Genesis models. That usually means slightly slower charging times, but Kia says the battery to charge from 10-80% in approximately 31 minutes—not too bad.
DC fast charging is said to peak around 128 kW—down from the EV6's peak DC-fast charging rate of about 225 kW, which can go from 10 to 80 percent in under 18 minutes when plugged into a 350-kW fast-charger. Kia officials told our colleagues at Motor1 Italy that this was done to get a flatter overall charging curve so that power stays consistent at 128 kW and doesn't dramatically drop off as some EVs do. Still, Kia claims the EV3 will be a distance runner, able to drive driving from Paris to Geneva on a single charge.
Interestingly, the EV3 is also front-wheel drive, unlike the EV6, EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and others. But it will offer a more upscale GT-Line model at launch and an eventual GT  performance-focused dual-motor all-wheel-drive model.
The EV3 also boasts the latest iteration of Kia's i-Pedal 3.0 regenerative braking system, a tweak of the system in existing cars now upgraded to ""reduce fatigue on long drives."" More details on that as we get it.
In terms of design, the EV3 should look quite familiar. It apes the EV9 and the EV5 midsize crossover sold in China, but in a smaller overall package. ""We relaunched the brand in 2021, and we're trying to make sure, from the design point of view, that we are physically creating the brand values in the product,"" said Karim Habib, Kia's global design chief. ""So that's why consistency is important.""
Inside, there's a lot of commonality with the EV9 as well—lots of physical buttons to complement the dual 12.3-inch touchscreens. The interior also boasts a sliding table for laptops and other gadgets and a storage area for backpacks, snacks and other gear. There's also a small ""frunk"" storage area up front, and it looks to be a little bigger than the tiny one used on the EV6 and others.
Kia says the EV3 incorporates many recycled materials and biologically derived components inside and out. The dashboard is made from sugar cane, and the plastic body cladding panels are partially made from recycled plastic bottles.
Kia also says the EV3 will come with its first-ever in-car AI assistant, derived from OpenAI's ChatGPT. While generative AI remains in its relative infancy, the feature is becoming more and more common on modern vehicles. Here, it's used to provide navigation assistance, things like restaurant recommendations and help with various other productivity tools. With over-the-air updates, the assistant is also said to get better over time.
Clearly, there's still a lot we don't know about the Kia EV3, especially about its North American launch. The exact EPA-estimated range, charging times, and prices should be released closer to the car's launch here, which Kia says will be next year.
When it does, it will enter the ""affordable but modern"" EV segment relatively early. Over the next year or so, that segment will include the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV, and potentially a smaller, cheaper Tesla model as well.
Given Kia's aggressive EV push and its critical success with the EV9 so far, the EV3 also seems poised to be a winner. Until more competitors come along, it may end up being the affordable compact EV to beat.

That’s what the South Korean automaker is hoping for, at least.
The all-new entry-level electric crossover, slated to debut in the United States later this year or early next year, will first appear in South Korea and Europe. Underpinned by Hyundai Motor Group’s modular E-GMP platform, the brand-new EV3 promises a lot of tech and efficiency in the subcompact segment, impressive range figures and fast charging speeds.
It was first revealed as a concept car in its home country last year, and now it's time for the production-spec version to go under the spotlight. The concept looked pretty much like the finished product, so we expect the series model to be more or less the same. It also had features like vehicle-to-load (V2L), and it will be interesting to see if that makes its way to the production version.

Pricing is yet to be determined, but we can expect the EV3 to start somewhere around $35,000 when it reaches dealerships stateside. That’s for a front-wheel drive EV that looks like a shrunken-down EV9 with two massive screens inside.
More details will be revealed during the global debut live stream, which you can watch embedded above. The show starts on May 23 at 6:00 AM EST, and you can rest assured that InsideEVs has all the bases covered regarding EV3-related content.

Alpine Wants To Sell A Hydrogen V-6 Road Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/720348/alpine-v6-road-car-considered/,It would have over 340 horsepower.,12/25/2024 9:03,"With Alpine coming to the United States in 2026, we're keeping a close eye on what Renault's performance division is planning. Like so many other brands, the French marque is investing in fully electric vehicles, but the combustion engine could still play a role. The ICE could be saved by making it run on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels.
Alpine's design boss Antony Villain told Autocar the Alpenglow isn't just for show since it was developed with a production car in mind. While the concept features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a bigger V-6 is already in development. It's going to have more than the 340 horsepower offered by the four-pot. The larger internal combustion engine might find its way into a street-legal model that would be sold in a limited series.
When asked whether the Alpenglow has a shot of making it to production, Villain replied: ""Why not? Why not have that on the roads? We want to keep both ways [hydrogen ICE and EV] possible. Maybe we could do a little series of these cars for the road. That could be just right."" Alpenglow is an evolution of a namesake concept from 2022 and Renault's go-faster division is already planning a third variant that'll look closer to a production vehicle.
The sports car's current iteration is off to a rocky start since it failed to take part during its maiden test in Belgium at the Spa-Francorchamps track. It wasn't the combustion engine's fault, but rather an electrical issue. As it stands, Alpenglow uses an LMP3 chassis from Ligier, replacing the original concept’s bespoke chassis. The smaller engine will be swapped out later this year for the new V-6.
Speaking during the Annual General Meeting last week, Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo hinted at putting the Alpenglow into production. He said the A110 is not going to be on sale for much longer but the lineup will be renewed and expanded to seven models. The portfolio will be ""100-percent electric and maybe, potentially, hydrogen-engine cars.""
In the meantime, it’s sadly too late for the mid-engine A110 to come to the United States. Its electric replacement is due here in 2026 as a coupe and roadster, with an SUV arriving in 2027 and a four-door A310 swoopy sedan to follow a year later.

General Motors' Plug-In Hybrids Are Coming Back To The U.S. In 2027,https://insideevs.com/news/720220/gm-plug-in-hybrids-us/,"Almost 20 years after the Chevrolet Volt went into development, GM will bring back hybrid cars with a plug. Will Americans buy them?",5/20/2024 8:41,"After abandoning the idea of plug-in hybrids in the United States half a decade ago with the demise of the second-generation Chevrolet Volt, General Motors will reverse course—just in time for the new federal vehicle emissions regulations and a market where it's worried about uneven demand for full EVs.
The first plug-in hybrid models to be sold in North America will arrive at dealerships in 2027, GM CEO Mary Barra said in an interview with The Detroit News, the same year the new tailpipe emissions-cutting rules go into effect. Coincidence? Absolutely not.
New emissions rules
Starting in 2027, automakers selling vehicles in the United States will have to improve the average fuel efficiency by 2% every year for cars and by 4% per year for light trucks. By model year 2032, the proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would require manufacturers to reach an average fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon per vehicle.
Of course, GM isn’t abandoning its all-electric vehicle plans. The Chevrolet Equinox EV is making its way to dealers, as is the retail-oriented Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, and there will be more affordable versions of all GM EVs coming by the end of this year, plus luxurious models from Cadillac. The reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV is coming soon as well.
More GM Stories
But as the regulations have changed and Americans’ appetite for pure electric vehicles has gone down in recent months, the automaker’s strategy shifted. Barra didn’t conceal that introducing plug-in hybrids while continuing to develop its EV portfolio is purely a regulation game.
“Plug-in hybrids are an important part of meeting the regulatory space and giving consumers more options. As the regulatory space evolved, it made sense for us to assess our strategy,"" Barra told The Detroit News.
It wasn’t a surprise back in January when GM’s head honcho told inventors that the company wanted to bring back plug-in hybrids, and it isn’t a surprise now. That said, we still don’t know what combustion-powered cars with an electrical plug will be available stateside three years from now.
In North America, GM’s last plug-in hybrid was the Chevrolet Volt, which was retired in 2019 as the company geared up for an all-electric future. In China, however, it’s a different story. Here, GM sells several plug-in hybrids and we might see a rebranded or slightly reengineered version of the Buick Velite 6 or the Wuling Starlight sedan. The Velite 6 is a station wagon that looks surprisingly similar to the European-spec Opel Astra, which used to be made by GM before Opel became part of Stellantis, while the Starlight is a larger, mid-size sedan.
Chevy Equinox Plus PHEV
The China-spec Buick Velite 6 is available as both a plug-in hybrid and an EV
Wuling Starlight
But seeing how the global automotive market seems to favor crossovers and SUVs, the China-spec Chevrolet Equinox Plus PHEV might have a higher chance of being sold stateside.
In a separate interview recently, GM President Mark Reuss confirmed to InsideEVs that similar PHEV technology as what's seen in China could be deployed on U.S. market cars, but it won't be the cars themselves. In other words, any U.S. PHEV models will be made more locally, not in China.

The New Bricklin Is Real And It Looks Questionable,https://www.motor1.com/news/719783/new-bricklin-3ev-details/,"The 3EV has three wheels, scissor doors, and a $28,980 starting price when it goes on sale ... sometime in the future.",12/25/2024 9:03,"The car you see here bears little resemblance to the iconic Bricklin SV-1 from the 1970s. Both have two seats and unconventional doors, and both have Bricklin branding. Beyond that, the bold-faced Bricklin 3EV you see here is in a class by itself ... for better or worse.
There is one other similarity between this Bricklin and its forerunner. Both are real. Visionary Vehicles is the company making the new car, which first appeared back in 2020 as a rendering. Frankly, we see renderings of proposed cars on a almost weekly basis, many of which never make it past the idea phase. So imagine our surprise when we came upon videos posted to the Visionary Vehicles website showing a 3EV prototype in action.
Details are still thin, but we know it's a three-wheeled EV utilizing body-on-frame construction with the battery pack centrally mounted between the frame rails. Power output is unknown, but the website promises ""superb performance"" along with a ""luxurious driving experience."" Diagrams from the company appear to show a single electric motor at the front, with the mid-mount battery giving the car favorable weight distribution. A range of 275-plus miles is mentioned, but specifics regarding charging speeds, vehicle weight, or the powertrain are unknown.
The 3EV is ""engineered by race car designers"" per the Visionary Vehicles website. Panoz Engineering is name-dropped, with MTV Concepts and Mike Vetter getting a mention for prototype fabrication. Andreas Haase is also listed for the styling, which certainly doesn't look like anything else on the road.
The tall face and dual grilles makes the BMW 4 Series snout look small. The squarish lines at the front give way to flowing fastback shapes at the rear, though the lack of wheel arches takes some getting used to.
This new Bricklin isn't just a rolling mock-up, though. We're shown a full interior with a digital cockpit not unlike something we'd expect from Mercedes-Benz. The entirety of the dash and console light up, with a dedicated infotainment screen in the middle for vehicle functions. The website mentions features like a heads-up display, power heated seats, over-the-air updates, and other common items found in modern cars. Cutting-edge equipment like anti-lock brakes and traction control are also mentioned, so we suspect the 3EV could be sparse with regard to driver-assist systems.
It should be sparse on your bank account, too. Visionary Vehicles says the 3EV will have a starting price of $28,980. An upgraded version called the 3EVX will start at $38,980, but there's an obvious catch: There's no mention of when production might begin. For that matter, there's no mention of a development timeline, pre-orders, or exactly where buyers can get one.
But a functioning prototype is a big step towards production. Whether it actually happens remains to be seen. Color us cautiously optimistic.

"BYD Shark, A Plug-In Hybrid Ford Ranger Rival, Launches In Mexico",https://insideevs.com/news/719677/byd-shark-phev-will-it-come-to-us/,The BYD Shark marks the Chinese automaker’s foray into the popular pickup truck segment. Will it ever come to the U.S.?,5/14/2024 16:59,"BYD doesn’t sell passenger vehicles here in the U.S., and the latest round of American tariffs on Chinese-made EVs all but ensures it won't for a while. But the automaking giant is going all guns blazing in Mexico. The world’s second-largest EV maker after Tesla already sells several all-electric models in the country, including the Tang SUV, Yuan crossover, and Seal sedan among others.
Now it has added another brand-new model to its portfolio in Mexico: the Shark plug-in hybrid. It's BYD’s first-ever pickup truck. The Shark marks BYD's entry into a segment traditionally dominated by American and Japanese carmakers. And for its first attempt, it appears impressive, at least on paper.
BYD's pickup truck enters global markets.
BYD's foray into the popular pickup truck arena that U.S. carmakers have traditionally dominated is meant to send a message: It plans to expand globally and is probably not rattled by punitive American tariffs.
Most specifications have now been announced on the BYD Mexico website. Apart from Mexico, BYD plans to sell the Shark in Brazil, Europe and Australia as well. Its only direct competitor is the Ford Ranger PHEV, but it will also lock horns with the likes of the Toyota Hilux and Chevrolet S10 among others, as our pals at Motor1 Brazil have pointed out. (While it has garnered headlines for its electric vehicles, BYD also sells a significant amount of hybrids as well.)
In terms of dimensions, the Shark is slightly longer and taller than the Ford Ranger, measuring 214 inches long, 77.5 inches wide and 75.5 inches tall. Its wheelbase spans 128.3 inches. The Shark’s maximum towing and payload capacities are 5,511 pounds and 1,840 pounds, respectively.
Like its rivals, it rides on a body-on-frame platform, using an architecture similar to that of the BYD Seal U SUV in China and the Fangchengbao range of off-road SUVs. BYD calls this the DMO platform, where DM stands for Dual Mode (hybrid) and O stands for off-road.
The plug-in hybrid system combines the 1.5-liter turbo engine with two electric motors, one on each axle, to deliver 430 horsepower. BYD says that’s enough to propel the truck from 0-62 miles per hour in 5.7 seconds.
Its electric-only range is about 62 miles on the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), so expect the real-world range to be much lower. It also uses BYD’s cutting-edge Blade battery, whose cells are part of the chassis structure.
In terms of design, the fascia has cues from the latest-generation Hyundai Santa Fe and the Ford F-150 Lightning. There’s a full-width LED light bar up front with a rather large floating BYD logo mounted on the radiator grille. Black cladding all around gives it the rugged off-roader look.
Inside, a 12.8-inch rotating infotainment screen dominates the dashboard, similar to the Seal. It is complemented by a 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster. Other notable features include a 12-inch heads-up display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and bidirectional charging among others.
BYD will offer the Shark in two variants in Mexico, GL and GS. The GL starts at 899,980 Mexican pesos (about $53,432) whereas the GS costs about 969,800 pesos ($57,577), according to the exchange rates at the time of publication.
By comparison, the Ford Ranger starts at around 818,000 pesos, while a mild-hybrid diesel Hilux costs about 851,400 pesos. In other words, the Shark is in good company.
The Biden Administration reportedly plans to slap a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, up from 25% previously. It’s unclear if that includes PHEVs, but launching a pickup truck in North America could be BYD’s message to the U.S. that it plans to expand its presence on the continent, regardless of what America thinks.
The question of whether Chinese EVs will enter the U.S. through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement remains debatable. Recent developments, including Mexico's refusal to engage in further discussions with Chinese automakers and the withdrawal of incentives, suggest that this prospect is improbable, at least for now.

The First Hybrid Porsche 911 Debuts on May 28,https://www.motor1.com/news/719326/porsche-911-hybrid-debut-may-28/,"It's 8.7 seconds quicker on the Nurburgring than its predecessor, the Carrera S",12/25/2024 9:03,"A completely new era for the Porsche 911 will begin on May 28. Porsche plans to reveal the first road-going 911 hybrid, pushing the iconic sports car into the modern era.
We've seen the 911 hybrid in prototype form for over two years now. Porsche tells us that development is now complete, amassing 3.1 million miles in the process. Some of that mileage comes from the Nürburgring, where Porsche shares a rather tantalizing clue as to what badge the electrified 911 will wear. We're told the hybrid laps the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 16.9 seconds, 8.7 seconds faster than ""the corresponding version of the predecessor model.""
Basic math brings us to 7:25.6, and a quick look through recent Porsche 911 Nurburgring lap times brings us to the 992-generation Carrera S, which turned a 7:25 lap back in 2020. Images shared from Porsche don't reveal badges, but the lack of bonkers bodywork points to something on the milder side. A Carrera S with a hybrid powertrain certainly fits that bill.
“For the first time in our icon’s 61-year history, we are installing a hybrid drive system in a roadgoing 911,"" said Frank Moser, Porsche vice president for the 911 and 718. ""This innovative performance hybrid makes the 911 even more dynamic. We left nothing to chance during development and tested the new 911 under all sorts of conditions all over the world from the freezing cold to scorching heat, as was the case during the final stages of testing in Dubai.""
Details of the hybrid powertrain are as yet unknown. Porsche tells us it's aimed at performance, not efficiency, and we were previously told it won't be a plug-in hybrid. With a 'Ring time of 7:16, is should be plenty fast without losing its capability to carve corners.
All will be revealed on May 28. Be sure to check back in 18 days time, we'll have everything you need to know.

Subaru Is Teaming Up With Toyota On 3 More Electric SUVs,https://insideevs.com/news/719520/subaru-electric-suv-toyota-2026/,Three more electric Subies should hit the market by 2026. The company says four in-house-developed EVs will arrive by 2028.,5/13/2024 16:30,"Subaru has been rather slow to the electric vehicle party, with only one model under its belt so far. As we've noted before, that's pretty odd given that electrification certainly fits with the company's nature-loving image and crunchy clientele. Subaru's EV efforts are set to ramp up considerably with the help of longtime partner Toyota.
Subaru plans to release three new electric SUVs jointly developed with Toyota by 2026, Automotive News reports. Subaru executives detailed the plans during an earnings presentation on Monday.
Subaru's slow EV rollout
Subaru sells one EV right now: the Solterra SUV, which is manufactured by Toyota. Japanese automakers on the whole have been slower to embrace EVs than their South Korean, European, Chinese and American counterparts.
Why team up? Subaru CEO Atsushi Osaki said it's risky for the small automaker to wade into the uncertain EV landscape alone.
“At the moment, it is quite difficult to predict how things will go from here with EVs,” Osaki said, per Automotive News. ""We have held talks with Toyota and have agreed that it is better to reduce risks through joint development.”
That makes a lot of sense. Subaru is a whole lot smaller than players like Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors. The research and development costs that go into creating an EV from scratch are huge, as are the investments required to reconfigure plants that previously made internal combustion vehicles. Subaru doesn't have as much money to throw around as some of the bigger automotive players, so it's leaning on Toyota to spread out some of the costs.
(Its strategy seems to be working out just fine in the short term. On Monday, Osaki touted a 75% increase in operating profit for Subaru's fiscal year.)
That may also be why Mazda, another small automaker, isn't exactly diving into the EV market either. But it's also worth noting that the whole Japanese auto industry has lagged behind in EVs. Toyota especially has pushed the idea that hybrids and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be more significant than most people think. Still, both it and Honda are pushing ahead with big plans for ground-up electric cars.
The Solterra, Subaru's sole electric offering.
The current rough patch in EV sales has provided some vindication for Toyota's trepidatious strategy. But the overall trends point to EVs making up much more of the global car market than they do today.
At least one of the upcoming Subaru EVs will be produced by Toyota in the U.S., potentially qualifying it for federal purchase incentives. By 2028, Subaru plans to launch four in-house EVs, it said on Monday. It's also preparing hybrid versions of the Crosstrek as well as its top seller in the U.S., the Forester.
Subaru's only EV today is the Solterra, an SUV that's a close sibling to the Toyota BZ4X. Both have been criticized for their substandard charging speeds and range. I think I speak for Toyota and Subaru fans everywhere when I say this: Let's hope these brands' next EVs bring a bit more to the table.

"2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz Comes To America With 91 kWh Battery, Up To 335 HP",https://insideevs.com/news/719466/2025-volkswagen-id-buzz-91kwh-trims/,The long-awaited electric bus comes in three trims and available AWD.,5/13/2024 13:30,"Volkswagen announced the offer structure for the 2025 ID. Buzz model, which will be available in a long-wheelbase (LWB) version in the U.S.
The three-row, all-electric van will be offered in three trim levels—Pro S, Pro S Plus and a launch-only 1st Edition—all equipped with a 91-kilowatt-hour battery, although there is no info about the driving range yet.
Volkswagen ID. Buzz Enters America
The Volkswagen ID. Buzz will enter the U.S. market in 2024 as a 2025 model year. It will be a long-wheelbase (LWB) version with a 91-kWh battery. Both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions to be available.
The standard features include 20-inch wheels, a 12.9-inch infotainment system, 30-color ambient lighting, and Park Assist Plus.
There will also be two powertrain choices: 282 horsepower (210 kilowatts) for rear-wheel drive models and 4Motion all-wheel drive with a peak output of 335 horsepower (250 kW). However, not all trims get the AWD option—the Pro S is only RWD.
An important thing is that depending on the trim and powertrain, the ID. Buzz will have seven seats with a bench in the rear or six seats with captain’s chairs. The base Pro S will be only RWD and 7-seat. The Pro S Plus RWD is 7-seat standard but has a 6-seat option, while in the Pro S Plus AWD version, six seats are standard. In the case of the limited 1st, RWD is a 7-seater, while AWD is a 6-seater.
In other words, there is no 7-seat and AWD combination, potentially due to gross weight limit:
According to previous reports, the 2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB is expected to arrive in Q3 2024. The company intends to release the range and pricing closer to launch.
When it comes to options, the Pro S Plus trim includes an electrochromic panoramic glass roof, Harmon/Kardon premium audio, a head-up display, a Flexboard cargo system, a manually retractable tow hitch, and an Area View camera.
The launch-only 1st Edition is based on the Pro S trim. It comes only with a two-tone exterior with unique 20-inch wheels, roof rail cross bars, and 1st Edition badging outside. Volkswagen also mentioned the coastal-inspired interior, heritage-inspired floor mats, and exclusive 1st Edition owner’s gifts.
Let's recall that the Volkswagen ID. Buzz (passenger and cargo version) entered production in Europe in 2022. Initially, the model was available with a ""standard"" wheelbase, RWD and an 82-kWh battery (the AWD, introduced in Europe in 2024, is named GTX). In the U.S., there will be only a long-wheelbase (LWB) and a slightly larger 91-kWh battery.
The Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB's wheelbase is 127.5 inches (3,239 mm), 9.8 inches longer than standard.
During the first quarter of 2024, Volkswagen Group sold roughly 7,000 ID. Buzz. With the expansion to North America, this number might further increase.

China's Zeekr Is Now A Public Company. Its Path To U.S. Sales Is Less Clear,https://insideevs.com/news/719313/zeekr-us-ipo-traded-nyse/,Is this hot-selling Geely Group newcomer headed to American shores after a big debut on Wall Street?,5/10/2024 16:53,"Geely Auto, the Hangzhou-based owner of Polestar and Volvo, has too many brands. But lately, one of them in particular kind of stands out: Zeekr. This morning, Zeekr officially entered the U.S. stock exchange at a price of $21 per share and an estimated valuation of more than $5 billion. Within a few minutes of officially being open for trading, and with Zeekr EVs parked outside for all of Lower Manhattan to see, the stock touched nearly $27, pushing the company’s valuation to $7 billion.
It was quite a show of force, especially right after the show of force at the Beijing Auto Show—and the tariff crackdown on Chinese-made EVs that would become news the very same day. What a day for Geely, the Zeekr brand, China and the battle for electrification in general.
Meet Zeekr, maybe the hottest Geely Group brand
Many American policymakers the prospect of Chinese-made cars. But China's Geely Group is already there in some ways, now that it owns Volvo, Lotus and Polestar—and some of those cars are made in China. Now all eyes are on its stylish Zeekr brand after today's public debut in New York.
Granted, this isn’t the first EV startup—or even the first Geely-affiliated brand—to go public. So we have to wonder: will this one fizzle out and underperform like the other IPOs of late? And what does this mean in the context of a thirsty yet uncertain EV market?
It’s not clear. Nothing is ever clear until the final shoe drops, and the markets close.
Since its IPO in 2022, Polestar has done almost nothing but sink, now trading at an abysmal 15 cents per share, as of this writing. I asked Zeekr how this time will be different, but the automaker's reps declined to comment.
Still, we can learn a lot if we just pay a little bit of attention. Let's compare Zeekr to other less-than-stellar newly public companies. It might just be a little bit more secure than the other special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) debuts that gave us the publicly traded Lotus and Polestar brands. It’s also in significantly better straits than VinFast, another IPO that fizzled out shortly after introduction. (Also, it's worth noting that nearly every company that went public with a SPAC, automotive or otherwise, has sunk like a rock.)
But one thing is certain: Zeekr is now the EV brand to watch, in China and beyond. It's already expanding into Mexico and Europe, and it may even have its eyes on the U.S. next. TechCrunch is already calling Zeekr ""the buzziest EV IPO of the year.""
Market position-wise, Zeekr occupies a luxury or premium segment that I’d say is equivalent to Acura or Audi. Zeekr is (theoretically) downmarket from Polestar, which aims to court Porsche buyers with its Scandinavian-style minimalist motif. Polestar is sort of a sporty Volvo, whereas Zeekr tends to focus more on exterior and interior adornment. That’s interesting since both Polestar and Zeekr’s design work was performed mostly at Geely’s Gothenburg, Sweden studio.
But while Polestar is really struggling for sales, Zeekr has consistently grown. Part of that success is offering a much fuller lineup of electric sedans, SUVs, wagons and even vans, while Polestar is just now getting around to adding two more crossovers after relying solely on the Polestar 2 sedan for so long.
For March 2024, Zeekr is up 117% year-over-year. It also has delivered more than 230,000 cars while expanding into more international markets. Last year Zeekr delivered 118,685 cars, while Polestar only moved 54,600. This means that Zeekr outsold Polestar at more than a 2 to 1 ratio, a number it mustered upright as the Chinese EV market is in a race to the bottom, price-wise.
Of course, like most EV startups, Zeekr hasn’t yet turned a profit. But Zeekr representatives said the brand is on track to be profitable by the end of 2024.
Zeekr is kind of an interesting duck here, especially for Americans. I’ve talked with Zeekr folks on several occasions here; the brand is more significant than a simple high-dollar electric Audi competitor. It’s responsible for a lot of the engineering and software work that is now used across the Geely Auto brands, including, yes, Polestar and Volvo. The Polestar 4 uses the same mechanical bits as the Zeekr 001. But just because Zeekr does a lot of behind-the-scenes work, doesn’t automatically mean it’ll come to the U.S.
Or does it?
Zeekr’s technology forms the basis for a self-driving Waymo car called the M Vision, and that's already a known quantity. But, when I’ve asked directly if Zeekr has plans for the U.S. outside of a commercial vehicle or its tie-up with Waymo, the brand has been fairly wishy-washy.
In October, Zeekr reps told me at a New York event that selling a passenger vehicle in the US was potentially on the table, but then followed up via e-mail saying it had no plans to sell passenger vehicles in the U.S.
I asked again a week before the IPO. “[The U.S.] is a market that [Zeekr is] looking at but not yet committing to for passenger vehicle sales,"" a Geely rep told me. ""Zeekr and Waymo are working together on the next generation of driverless vehicles; Zeekr will be providing the vehicle hardware, Waymo the driverless tech and experience.”
However, the U.S.’s attitude toward imported Chinese EVs has rapidly deteriorated within just a week of getting that statement. Zeekr's vehicles from China could face a new 100% tariff on its vehicles, which isn’t great for the brand’s outlook as a potential U.S. passenger car offering—or the price of its stock.
As my colleague Tim Levin said today, we’re entering a sort of automotive cold war here. Will Zeekr’s cars end up on sale in the U.S.? Right now, that feels more murky than ever.

Mercedes CEO Says EV Transition 'Might Take Longer Than Expected',https://insideevs.com/news/719012/mercedes-ev-gas-car-sales/,"Mercedes-Benz will keep making gas-powered cars ""well into the 2030s"" if buyers want them.",5/9/2024 10:00,"Mercedes-Benz once envisioned an aggressive, fast-paced transition to electric-only sales by the end of the decade. Now, amid a slowdown in the pace of EV sales growth, it's convinced that combustion engines have a future well beyond 2030. Mercedes-Benz chairman and CEO Ola Källenius made that clear during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.
""The strategic aim of Mercedes-Benz is zero emissions. That is certain. However, the transformation might take longer than expected,"" Källenius said, doubling down on similar comments he made earlier this year.
Automakers slowing their roll on EVs
EV sales have hit a rough patch. It's probably a combination of charging anxiety, high interest rates, high vehicle prices and a dwindling market of early adopters. That's making some automakers pull back their electrification plans.
He said that factors like how quickly charging infrastructure expands will impact the pace of Mercedes-Benz's zero-emission transition. Sales of hybrids, he said, could continue well into the 2030s ""if the demand is there.""
In other words, Mercedes plans to sell combustion-powered cars as long as people want them. Mercedes has set its plants up for flexibility, Källenius said, so that it can adjust capacity for both gas-powered and battery-electric cars to meet consumer demand.
However, Mercedes will have to contend with tightening emissions regulations worldwide. So, it must clean up its fleet regardless of consumer appetite.
Automakers, including General Motors and Ford, began pumping the brakes on their EV investments late last year, citing lower-than-expected demand from a changing customer base. EV sales have indeed hit some speed bumps in recent months, particularly when you look at Tesla's dismal first quarter.
But don't misinterpret the doom and gloom from Mercedes and others. EV sales have grown spectacularly in recent years and will continue to eat up an increasing share of the global auto market. Mercedes-Benz brand EV sales were up 73% in 2023. The automaker's backpedaling may have a lot to do with profitability concerns around its electric cars. As old-school automakers invest heavily in EVs, they've been deriving most of their profits from gas-powered cars and SUVs. Last year, Mercedes warned that the ""brutal"" EV market could harm its margins.

It's also important to note that Mercedes isn't doing as well on the electric front as its perennial rival, BMW. Electric cars made up 14.7% of BMW's global sales last year, versus 11.8% for Mercedes. In absolute terms, BMW sold 376,183 EVs across its brands in 2023. Mercedes-Benz's EV sales came in at 240,600.

"Lucid's Upcoming Midsize Car Targets $48,000 Price, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/718837/lucid-motors-midsize-price-48000/,The mysterious smaller Lucid is slated to start production in late 2026.,5/7/2024 15:53,"Lucid Motors' upcoming midsized vehicle will cost about the same as a Tesla Model Y Long Range, the EV startup's CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson reaffirmed on a call Monday evening. And his remarks indicated it may even be slightly more affordable than initially expected.
On Lucid's first-quarter earnings call, Rawlinson said that the future model will be priced at around $48,000. In the past, Lucid has said the vehicle would cost somewhere around $50,000.
Lucid Motors' path forward
Lucid Motors hit the market in 2021 with the Air, an impressive albeit expensive sedan. The upcoming Gravity SUV and a farther-off midsized vehicle are what Lucid hopes will launch it to profitability and wider recognition.
The vehicle, aka Project Midsize, is still years away, so that price could very well change. In recent years, numerous companies have either jacked up or slashed prices for their EVs due to changing materials costs and consumer demand. On Monday's conference call, Rawlinson said the model is still on track to start production in late 2026.
Lucid has only shown the midsize model under a sheet, so we don't know exactly what it looks like. It appears to be a crossover SUV-type vehicle.
The midsized platform is key to Lucid's growth and path to profitability. The startup produces an amazingly impressive sedan called the Air, but it's on the pricy side and hasn't sold in the kind of numbers Lucid expected. The company says it's on track to produce 9,000 Airs this year, roughly matching 2023's figures. That isn't because Lucid can't build them faster, Rawlinson explained on Monday. It's about drumming up demand.
""We are not manufacturing constrained. This isn't a ramp-up situation,"" he said. ""It's about growing awareness of just how awesome the product is and the sales will follow. And that's the trajectory we're on.""
More Lucid Stories
A $48,000 vehicle would dramatically expand Lucid's addressable market. That's not cheap, but it's in the same ballpark as Tesla's Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, some of the most popular electric cars on the planet. Fellow EV startup Rivian's R2 SUV is set to launch around the same time at a starting price of $45,000.
First, Lucid needs to execute on the Gravity SUV, its hotly anticipated next act after the Air. The three-row family hauler is slated to enter production later this year. It, too, promises to attract a whole new set of customers—and a boatload of revenue—to the fledgling automaker. It and the midsized platform are what's standing between Lucid being a niche maker of luxury cars that loses money and a significant player moving real volume.
What do you think? Would you buy a Lucid midsized car at $48,000? Let us know in the comments.

Jeep Gladiator 4xe Plug-In Hybrid Coming In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/718781/jeep-gladiator-4xe-plug-in-hybrid-confirmed-2025/,"The plug-in pickup will likely use the same powertrain as its Wrangler 4xe sibling, which is America’s best-selling PHEV.",5/7/2024 14:00,"After discontinuing the diesel-powered Gladiator pickup last year, the only powertrain available for Jeep’s sole pickup was the 3.6-liter V-6, which makes 285 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque.
But starting next year, the Gladiator will get the plug-in hybrid treatment, as the Stellantis-owned marque is expanding its electrified lineup. According to Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa, who posted the news on his LinkedIn account (post embedded below), the Gladiator 4xe PHEV will join the Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe–the best-selling PHEVs in the United States last year–starting in 2025.
Another PHEV for Jeep
Jeep already made a name for itself in the United States with the plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe. The two electrified vehicles are the best-selling PHEVs in the U.S., so Jeep is adding a third 4xe-wearing model starting next year: the Gladiator pickup.
Filosa left out all technical details about the upcoming plug-in Gladiator, but it will likely feature the same powertrain found on the Wrangler PHEV. That’s a 2.0-liter inline-four that works together with a starter generator and an electric motor that’s integrated into the eight-speed gearbox.
More Jeep Stories
In total, the Wrangler 4xe’s powertrain makes 375 hp and 470 lb-ft, which is much more than what the gas-powered V-6 is capable of despite the engine having a smaller displacement.
On the plug-in hybrid Wrangler, the high-voltage lithium-ion battery that provides juice to the electric motor has a capacity of 17 kilowatt-hours, resulting in an EPA-estimated all-electric range of 22 miles.
Again, we don’t know if these specs will be the same on the Gladiator, but they’re a good starting point for people shopping around. It’s also worth noting that because the electric motor is integrated into the gearbox, the Wrangler and the upcoming Gladiator PHEV retain their well-known off-road prowess because the drivetrain is unchanged compared to their ICE siblings. As such, the solid front and rear axles are still there from the factory.
Set to be built at the same Toledo, Ohio plant as the Wrangler and ICE Gladiator, the upcoming plug-in Jeep pickup will be joined by range-extended electric versions of the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer in 2025, while fully electric versions of the two SUVs will come in 2027. The agreement between Stellantis and the United Auto Workers union states that an all-electric Grand Cherokee will also debut in 2027, while the Wrangler will get full electric and range-extended versions a year later.",Iulian Dnistran
Pininfarina Made An Electric Batmobile You Can Actually Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/718046/pininfarina-b95-battista-batman/,"If you have as much money as Bruce Wayne, of course.",12/25/2024 9:03,"Automobili Pininfarina has created a new line of ultra-exclusive cars that take their styling inspiration from Batman’s civilian persona, Bruce Wayne. The two models—the B95 and Battista—feature unique design touches tailored to make you feel like the billionaire comic book hero.
Pininfarina created two trims for its two cars: Gotham and Dark Knight. Gotham cars feature tan leather upholstery, bespoke center panel quilting, and tan stitching. The other trim uses black Alcantara, black leather upholstery, and black and gold duo-tone contrast stitching.
The Gotham Battista wears Argento Vittorio gloss paint on its exterior and has a Nero Torino roof. Pininfarina backlit its iconic logo, finishing it in brushed and polished anodized aluminum. The car has 20-inch front and 21-inch rear alloy wheels with gloss-black faces and matte-black rims. The B95 wheels closely match the Battista’s, featuring matte-black inner and gloss-black outer rings.
The Dark Knight Battista and B95 have Nero Profondo exteriors and Nero Torino roofs. They also share the same ceramic-polished rims.
Each car has a 120.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery powering four electric motors that generate 1,900 horsepower. The B95 and Battista can fly to 62 miles per hour in less than two seconds. The displays feature Wayne Enterprises enhancements and an instruction voice modeled after Alfred Pennyworth.
Pininfarina also tweaked the Battista’s aerodynamics, giving it new tailgate shark fins, louver openings, and rear carbon wings. It also has Wayne Enterprises logos on the side skirts and roof.
The special Pininfarina cars are the latest in a line of new products looking to wring every bit of value out of the Batman brand. The automaker and Wayne Enterprises, a luxury brand developed by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products, will launch their partnership at BruceWayneX.com and host an “invite-only, first-of-its-kind retail theatre concept” this summer where a lucky few will get to see a Battista. The site also has limited-edition jet skis, bicycles, and the iconic Tumbler from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy.
Pininfarina doesn't how much these two Batman-themed special editions might cost, but the Battista starts at $2.2 million and the B95 costs $4.8 million. So you'll need to be as rich as Bruce Wayne.

The Kia EV9 GT Arrives January 2025 with 'Enormous Power',https://www.motor1.com/news/717574/kia-ev9-gt-january-2025-debut/,"Meanwhile, an updated EV6/EV6 GT and Sportage will debut later this year.",12/25/2024 9:03,"Kia released business results for the first quarter of 2024, full of the usual sales and financial jargon. But with that press release, the company also published a recording of its CEO's Investor Day speech that took place earlier this month. And in it we discovered some juicy details about upcoming product.
The EV9 GT will break cover in January 2025 with ""enormous power"" from an upgraded dual-motor setup. Kia says it'll do 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds, which is impressive given the large SUV’s heft, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds. We’re expecting a major power boost over the 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet offered by the most potent version on sale today. The additional oomph will help the GT version shave off more than one second from the sprint time.
Unless Kia plans to improve the battery chemistry, the range will probably to take a hit. That's what usually happens when an EV gets the performance treatment at the expense of efficiency. The EV9 GT-Line available today does 270 miles on a single charge, per EPA. Kia mentions the full-fat GT model is getting a beefier suspension setup and upgraded brakes.
This isn't the only electric Kia SUV about to spawn a GT version. Although not mentioned during the CEO Investor Day, the EV5 GT (pictured below) has already made an early appearance in China. It was recently homologated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, with images showing up on MIIT's website.
Later during the presentation, which we've attached below, a product roadmap was displayed in the background. An updated EV6 is scheduled for a market launch in the second quarter of this year. The sporty EV6 GT will follow in early Q4. Kia also plans to tweak the popular Sportage in the final quarter of the year. Elsewhere, the first-ever EV3 and new K4 are coming in Q3 when the large K8 sedan unavailable in the United States is bound to get a mid-cycle facelift.
But first, a five-door hatchback version of the also-not-for-America K3 compact sedan is coming soon.

This Lotus Evija Broke A Very Specific Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/717421/lotus-evija-x-debut/,The 6:24 lap is the fastest of any car with a chassis of a production model.,12/25/2024 9:03,"Remember that wild Lotus Evija X we saw last year testing at the Nürburgring? It's now finally out. Strictly a one-off, the electric beast is a track-only version of the hypercar that holds a very specific record for being the fastest vehicle around the Nordschleife with the chassis of a production car. Allow us to explain.
It completed the lap in 6 minutes and 24 seconds, or 11 seconds less than the Mercedes-AMG One. The F1-engined machine is the fastest street-legal car ever around the 'Ring. However, the Lotus Evija X is not the fastest car overall to complete a lap of the Green Hell. The Volkswagen ID.R took 6:05 while the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo remains unbeaten, at an incredible 5:19.
Because neither the ID. R nor the 919 Hybrid Evo has any connection with production models, Lotus can brag about the Evija X's performance. It's worth noting that there has been another car faster than the Lotus beyond those two. In 1983, Stefan Bellof drove the 956 to a 6:11 lap. In the same year and with the same car, Jochen Mass crossed the finish line in 6:16.
The Evija X is likely to return to the Nürburgring and try to shave off seconds from its already impressive lap time. The performance it achieved back in October 2023 was on a damp track, so there's room for improvement. Lotus says we should ""watch this space"" regarding a potentially better time.
Aside from the crazy aero with a massive wing, the track car has Pirelli slicks along with new dampers and carbon fiber brakes. Underneath the skin is the same carbon fiber tub and quad-motor setup with 2,011 horsepower and 1,257 pound-feet of torque as found in the street-legal Evija. The four electric motors draw their juice from a relatively small 70-kWh battery pack mid-mounted behind the seats.
Lotus touts a 0 to 62 mph in less than three seconds and a 62 to 124 mph in under three seconds as well. The 124 mph to 186 mph sprint is said to take less than four seconds. Flat out, the road car is electronically capped at 218 mph. The road-going Evija has entered production many years after its debut, and only 130 units will be assembled.

"The Mazda EZ-6 Is The Electric, Rear-Wheel-Drive Mazda Sport Sedan We Want",https://insideevs.com/news/717485/mazda-ez6-china-debut/,"Available as an EV or a PHEV, the EZ-6 is an incredibly handsome and modern sport sedan. Hey Mazda, what would it take to bring this stateside?",4/25/2024 13:03,"I'm a fan of Mazda. I think that everybody who loves well-designed, fun-to-drive cars probably appreciates the brand on some level. That's why it's been especially disappointing to see Mazda end up somewhere between ""very late"" and ""non-entity"" in the electrification game. Sure, it has some plug-in hybrids and more are coming, but what would happen if Mazda really set its mind to EVs?
Today we found out at the Beijing Auto Show. The answer is the Mazda EZ-6, and it's a proper rear-wheel-drive, all-electric or plug-in hybrid sedan with next-level Mazda good looks. And I'm already a fan.
Mazda's slow approach to EVs
Mazda only offers one fully electric vehicle, the MX-30, and that was discontinued in the U.S. The Japanese brand, known for sporting cars like the Miata, has been an extreme latecomer to the electrification game. That may soon be changing, especially as Mazda seeks to keep up its sales in China.
This story comes with the usual caveats, like the fact that because it's a joint project with China's Chongqing Changan Automobile, it's extremely unlikely to ever come to North American shores. And considering how hard the ""foreign"" brands are getting hammered in China as the homegrown competition steps up, it's anyone's guess how successful it will be.
But here is a handsome, electrified, rear-drive Mazda four-door. I'm into it.
The design here is a clear evolution of the ""Kodo"" design language that's so appealing on the brand's other cars. It's supposed to be fun, too; Mazda says the ""Jinba Ittai"" (meaning horse and rider as one) spirit is baked deep into the chassis for sporty handling and braking. The EV model even has 50:50 weight distribution and an electric-powered rear spoiler. It also offers ""intelligent parking technology"" that even works outside the vehicle, implying some kind of Tesla Summon-like feature to me.
Mazda isn't offering any key powertrain details here, such as electric battery size, horsepower, zero to 60 mph times or even what size internal combustion engine the PHEV model will use. But the automaker does say the EV version will have a range of 600 km (372 miles) and the hybrid will do an impressive 1,000 km (621 miles.) Note that all of that is on China's range testing cycle, which is different from ours, but interesting nonetheless.
Even if Chinese car buyers are turning inward, Mazda also says it will keep working with local partner Changan to make the cars those people want, which increasingly are full-EV or have some form of electrification. ""Going forward, Mazda will continue to work with Changan Automobile to turn Mazda’s China business around by introducing its unique products that meet the needs of Chinese customers who prefer advanced vehicles,"" Mazda CEO Masahiro Moro said in a news release.
I wish I could say that this car previews some kind of EV (or even PHEV) sedan we're getting in the U.S. too, but I'd say that's extremely unlikely. Instead, it is proof that even if it needs a local Chinese partner to do it, Mazda is making moves in the electrification space.
And hey, let's hope any new Mazda sedans that come our way do look this good—and are powered by electrons, too.

Lamborghini Urus Plug-In Hybrid Keeps the V-8 and Adds More Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/717143/lamborghini-urus-se-phev-details/,"The Lamborghini Urus SE gets a transmission-mounted electric motor that, combined with the twin-turbo V-8, delivers 789 horsepower.",12/25/2024 9:03,"Leave it to Lamborghini to make a plug-in hybrid SUV exciting. The new Urus SE is an electrified version of the company's best-selling model, now with more power and speed. Although a PHEV setup typically implies a downsized engine, that's not the case here. The twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is sticking around, supplemented by an electric motor.
Housed within the eight-speed automatic transmission, the e-motor produces 189 horsepower and 356 pound-feet of torque. The gasoline engine is rated at a substantial 612 hp and 590 lb-ft. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 789 hp at 6,000 rpm and a mountain-moving 701 lb-ft from 1,750 rpm.
Compared to the Urus S, the new SE is 0.1 seconds quicker to 62 mph, completing the task in 3.4 seconds. It's worth noting the Performante remains the quickest of the Urus range, at 3.3 seconds. This new raging bull reaches 124 mph in 11.4 seconds, or 1.1 second before the gas-only version, and even 0.1 seconds before the spicy Urus Performante. Flat out, it can do 194 mph, making it a tiny bit faster than both V-8-only flavors.
The Urus SE comes with a 25.7-kWh lithium-ion battery mounted below the cargo floor, good for over 37 miles of pure electric range. Driven in EV mode, the SUV tops out at 81 mph. After that, the V-8 automatically kicks in. Lamborghini goes as far as to say emissions are down by 80 percent compared to the pure ICE model.
With the plug-in hybrid, Lamborghini takes the opportunity to give the SUV a nip and tuck. Those updated matrix LED headlights now have a daytime running light signature that takes after a bull's tail, or so we're told. There are some discreet tweaks to the front section with design elements derived from the Revuelto supercar. The rear apparently takes after the Gallardo, and increases downforce by 35 percent compared to the Urus S.
Lambo will sell the electrified SUV with new 23-inch wheels, over 100 body color options, and 47 interior themes. If none of them tickle your fancy, there's also the Ad Personam program for one-off builds ... provided your bank account can handle it. The Urus SE comes with a pair of 12.3-inch screens and four new selectable modes: EV Drive, Hybrid, Performance, and Recharge. These are on top of the usual Strada, Sport, Corsa, Neve, Sabbia, and Terra.
We're wondering whether a similar V-8 PHEV setup is also planned for the Huracan replacement coming later this year. We already know Lamborghini is retiring the V-10, with plans to downsize going forward.
As for the Urus, Lamborghini has already confirmed the second-generation model will be strictly an EV when it launches in 2029. So if you want a gas-powered exotic SUV from the legendary Italian brand, get your order in now.

The Mini Aceman Is An Electric City Crossover With Up To 252 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/717331/mini-aceman-electric-official-specs-range/,Say hello to Mini’s new entry-level crossover. Again.,4/24/2024 10:15,"In what feels like the third rerun of Groundhog Day, the all-new Mini Aceman electric urban crossover has been officially unveiled–this time, without wearing any camouflage.
Mini’s new entry-level crossover, which sits between the new Cooper hatchback and Countryman crossover, did the rounds several times in the past 12 months, including in a set of official photos showing the car wearing some funky camo. But this time it’s officially … official.
Mini Aceman debuts as the company's smallest electric crossover
The Mini Aceman is here. Well, sort of. It debuted in China today and will reach Europe later this year, but it's unclear if it will become available in the United States. That leaves Americans with just the Countryman as the all-electric Mini crossover.
The electric Aceman will be available with two powertrain options, both front-wheel drive. The Aceman E has a single electric motor that makes 181 horsepower (135 kilowatts) and 213 pound-feet of torque, enabling it to sprint from zero to 62 miles per hour in 7.9 seconds.
More Mini News
The sportier Mini Aceman SE gets a power boost to 214 hp (160 kW) and a torque bump to 243 lb-ft, while the 0-62 mph time goes down to 7.1 seconds.
A 42.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides energy to the base Aceman E and enables a WLTP-rated range of up to 192 miles, while the top-spec Aceman SE gets a larger, 54.2-kWh pack that ups the maximum driving range to 252 miles on a full charge.
Speaking about charging, Mini’s smallest electric crossover can be topped up from an AC source at up to 11 kW. When connected to a DC fast charger, the Aceman E can accept up to 75 kW and the Aceman SE up to 95 kW, leading to a 10% to 80% recharge in just under 30 minutes, the company said.
As with every other Mini model, the electric Aceman’s go-kart feel is touted in the very first paragraph of the official press release, so until we get to drive it, we have to take the company’s word for it.
Inside, the (presumably) most affordable all-electric crossover in the automaker’s lineup features roughly the same dashboard layout as its slightly smaller hatchback sibling. There’s a round OLED display that doubles as the infotainment and instrument cluster on top of the center console and a set of toggles under it for things like the gear selector, parking brake and start/stop switch.
There’s space for five people and a 10.59 cubic feet (300 liters) boot that can be expanded to 35.49 cu-ft (1,005 l) when the back seats are folded.
The electric Mini Aceman is 160.2 inches long, 68.8 in wide and 59 in tall, making it roughly 9 in shorter than the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV.
Four trim levels will be offered. The Essential features black sports seats, a two-spoke steering wheel and a colored textile inlay on the dashboard. The Classic trim comes with a three-spoke steering wheel, while the Favored trim includes a dashboard finished in Dark Petrol and sports seats with perforated Vescin fabric.
Mini's new all-electric lineup features the Cooper hatchback (left), Aceman (center) and Countryman (right)
The top JCW trim–note that this is not the high-performance John Cooper Works version but just an equipment level–replaces the standard front seats with a pair that offers more lateral support wrapped in multi-colored knitted textile and black synthetic leather.
The electric Mini Aceman will initially be built in China by Spotlight Automotive, a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group, Mini’s parent company, and Great Wall Motor. In 2026, the Mini plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, will also start assembling the battery-powered Aceman.
Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, and as it stands now, the Aceman is not coming to the United States, with a company spokesperson telling InsideEVs that “we have not confirmed U.S. market availability at this time.”",Iulian Dnistran
2025 BMW i4 Gets A New Face And Laser Tail Lights,https://insideevs.com/news/717127/2025-bmw-i4-facelift-specs/,The driving range is unchanged compared to the outgoing model.,4/24/2024 8:53,"The all-electric BMW i4 four-door liftback just got a mild facelift, three years after its introduction. The 2025 BMW i4 comes with a redesigned face that includes full LED headlights, laser-accented tail lights and several other cosmetic changes inside and outside.
That said, the official press release doesn’t mention anything about the car’s performance, driving range or charging speeds, so the specs are most likely the same as on the outgoing model.
BMW's most affordable EV gets a makeover, albeit a small one
The BMW i4 is the German company's cheapest electric vehicle, and it just got a mid-life refresh that brings a redesigned face and some other visual tweaks.
However, the hard specs remain unchanged compared to the outgoing model, so will the cosmetic changes be enough to convince new buyers?
In other words, expect the 2025 BMW i4 to offer up to 536 horsepower and 586 pound-feet of torque as is the case with the top-spec 2024 i4 M50, while the maximum estimated range should be 307 miles, as with the 2024 i4 eDrive40.
Two battery sizes are currently available, depending on the selected version: 68.7 kilowatt-hours and 84.3 kilowatt-hours. Charging the battery from a DC fast charger takes roughly 30 minutes, according to BMW. The i4's updated Plug & Charge Multi Contract function also lets you store up to five ""contracts"" with EV charging companies, allowing you to plug in and pay for electricity immediately without having to use a credit card or authentication app.
More BMW i4 Stories
On the outside, the facelift brings redesigned adaptive full LED headlamps as standard on all models, black high-gloss accents, new paint finishes and new alloy wheels. The top-spec i4 M50 xDrive also gets BMW’s Laserlight tail lights as standard, while lesser models can get the visually intricate feature when the optional Shadowline Package is fitted.
The laser-accented rear lights have laser diodes that illuminate a fiber optic bundle resulting in a look similar to that seen on the limited-edition BMW M4 CSL. On the M Performance i4 M50, the front vertical kidney grille has a black high-gloss surround.
Inside, the refreshed i4 comes with the automaker’s latest iDrive infotainment system which is underpinned by the BMW Operating System version 8.5. The multimedia suite can be specced together with a curved display and the Live Cockpit Professional feature that comes with a full-color head-up display and the ability to show the driver an augmented reality video on the center screen when using the navigation system.
The latest iDrive version also gets rid of the physical buttons for the climate control system and integrates them into the digital realm.
The 2025 i4, as well as its combustion-powered 4 Series Gran coupe sibling, gets sport seats covered in perforated Sensatec fabric as standard, as well as a two-spoke steering wheel with illuminated multifunction buttons. The optional M Sport Package adds a leather M steering wheel in a three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a black center stripe marking the 12 o’clock position.
Production of the facelifted BMW i4 will start in July 2024 at the company’s plant in Munich, Germany. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but we expect the 2025 i4 to have a starting MSRP similar to the outgoing model.
The base 2024 BMW i4 eDrive35, which has an estimated driving range of 252-276 miles starts at $52,200, while the top i4 M50 trim starts at $69,700.",Iulian Dnistran
Future Electric Mercedes Cars Will Be Named 'With EQ Technology',https://insideevs.com/news/717212/mercedes-eq-naming-electric/,"Say goodbye, eventually, to the ""EQE"" and ""EQS"" naming scheme. Mercedes is sticking with the iconic names you know and love for future EVs.",4/24/2024 8:12,"The folks at Mercedes-Benz won't come out and directly say it, but they get that people aren't really into the current ""EQ"" family of electric vehicles. Their ultra-smooth styling has proven extremely polarizing, sales have trailed rivals like BMW, and to top it off, there's no way around the awkwardness of names like ""AMG EQS SUV."" So for its next go at EVs, Mercedes is taking a different approach: keeping the ""class"" names people know and love, but appending the title ""with EQ Technology,"" just like on this new Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology.
We've known for over a year that Mercedes was planning to drop the dedicated ""EQ"" brand for electric vehicles. But we didn't know what form the next step would take until Britta Seeger, the Mercedes AG board member for marketing and sales, confirmed the new strategy on a call with reporters ahead of the electric G-Class' debut.
Mercedes' rocky EV rollout
In the high-tech arms race toward the future of cars, Mercedes leads in some areas, like voice-controlled features. But in many ways it is trailing rivals like BMW who are making the electric transition with stronger sales, and the current crop of EQ-branded EVs have proven extremely polarizing. Will this new naming system keep things more familiar?
""This is the first car where we say, we'll keep our product name and we concentrate on the technology which is inside,"" Seeger said of that SUV. ""To 99-point-something percent, you will see they're equal, design-wise. This is why we've chosen to say this is a G-Class with EQ Technology. This will be, going forward, our nomenclature for those cars.""
She added that models ""on the market"" right now, like the EQE and recently redesigned EQS, will keep their current names. But she confirmed that upcoming models, such as the production version of the electric CLA Concept, would be called ""CLA with EQ Technology"" or something similar.
""Why did we choose [to do] so? Because we've seen that message the Mercedes customers they love to identify themselves with the classes we have,"" she said, such as being an E-Class or S-Class owner. ""We believe it's the right point in time to stand with the G-Class name and concentrate on the technology that you find inside, and this will be the same for all future cars to come.""
Seeger added, ""This is why we put, at the forefront, the classic Mercedes name of a class [like] C-Class, and then we concentrate on the technology.""
The move makes sense, and it tracks with a certain sentiment both inside the company and outside of it: that the current approach with the EQ cars isn't exactly working.
At CES this year, Mercedes’ VP of car engineering Christoph Starzynski told Top Gear that those cars' designs have put off traditional Benz buyers. And in a ""fully electric"" world, it was becoming a challenge to name all of their cars. (For the record, I am actually a fan of the EQE sedan, but I seem to be in the minority there.)
Besides, names like S-Class, E-Class and G-Class have decades of brand equity that other rivals would kill for; why get rid of those just because the powertrains are different? It's a bit like how BMW's upcoming Neue Klasse platform is expected to keep the 3 Series and X3 names in some way. Automakers don't want to throw those out when they dump gasoline.
Audi has had similar struggles, but instead is opting to make even-numbered cars like A4 and Q6 into EVs while keeping the odd-numbered ones combustion-powered. We'll see how long that approach sticks around, because it's arguably more confusing.
With any luck, then, the new G-Class with EQ Technology gives us a preview of what to expect from Mercedes in the coming years: cars much closer to the conventional ones everyone knows, just with batteries instead of engines—and maybe a bit more of a mouthful of a name.

Mercedes-Benz G580 With EQ Technology: A Quad-Motor Electric Off-Roader With Old School Vibes,https://insideevs.com/news/717037/2025-mercedes-g-wagen-electric/,"On the surface, there are very few surprises about the electric G580. It's under the skin that matters.",4/23/2024 22:30,"When it came time for Mercedes-Benz to turn the iconic G-Class SUV into an electric vehicle, certain voices within the company suggested it become smoother, more streamlined, less brick-like in shape, all for the sake of efficiency. Those voices were met with a clear and decisive response: ""No.""
Meet what used to be called the Mercedes-Benz EGQ, and is now officially named the 2025 Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology instead. It's a fancy and somewhat convoluted name for something relatively simple in concept: a G-Class SUV that's powered by batteries and not a diesel or gasoline engine. And though it doesn't look that way on the surface, it represents the most radical change in the Geländewagen's entire history.
Mercedes' EV push has had some setbacks
Customers have not warmed to Mercedes' EV offerings as they have with some other competitors, like BMW. The company is slowing down its own EV plans, but new offerings like this electric G-Class show it's far from done.
“Throughout its more than 45-year history, the G-Class has always used the most modern drive technology available,"" Mercedes board member Markus Shäfer said in a news release. ""So, it's entirely fitting that the innovative drive concept with four individually controlled electric motors once again raises the legendary performance of our off-road icon to a new level.""
Indeed, the word ""icon"" comes up quite a bit when Mercedes talks about this EV; clearly, the automaker didn't want to mess with a design that hasn't changed much since its debut in 1979.
Then again, who would really want a G-Class that doesn't look like it's about to be deployed to some global hot zone? Even if the luxury SUV is now ultra-popular with Russian gangsters, petrostate nepo babies and Instagram influencers, it just isn't the same without that military truck vibe.
The twin-turbocharged V8 engine that served as the hallmark of the G-Class in recent years is a tough act to follow. In its place, Mercedes has packed a relatively large 116-kWh lithium-ion battery into the steel ladder frame of the truck. That's protected by a mix of materials, including carbon, to keep your next off-roading excursion lithium-ion battery fire-free, at least hopefully.
The battery powers four independently controlled electric motors located near the wheels, which deliver a collective 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque. Its EPA-estimated electric range has not been released yet. But we know that power is enough to propel the hefty electric G-Class (the weight also remains undisclosed) from a stop to 60 mph in just 4.6 seconds.
The G with EQ Technology—maybe we'll stick to EQG for brevity's sake—can also undergo DC fast charging at a respectable 200 kW rate. That allows it to charge from 10% to 80% in 32 minutes, according to Mercedes, which is not as good as some new contenders but isn't too far off the rest of the truck pack these days.
Like other EQ models, the electric G-Class adds Navigation with Electric Intelligence, which provides on-the-fly adjustments to your charging needs based on traffic, road hazards, the overall route, topography and more. It can alert you to a charging station when you'll need it, and then find a good one near you. I have used this system on other electric Benzes and it is indeed one of the smarter ones on the market today, and a welcome addition to the G-Class.
Other than that, visually, little is different between the EQG and the fossil fuel-powered G-Class. The hood is raised slightly on the electric SUV, flared rear wheel arches with “air curtains”, new A-pillar cladding and the lack of exhaust pipes give it away.
There's also the unique rectangular Design Box on the rear door, which allows for stowage of things like charging cables (detachable ones are the norm in Europe) or snow chains.
But it's clear that Mercedes didn't just shove some batteries into the G-Class and call it a day.
But even if few of them get driven this way—the G-Class' biggest market is Miami—these SUVs still have to be off-road-capable. And the electric G doesn't seem to disappoint on that front.
Features include a ""low-range"" off-road gear reduction, the G-Turn rotation function, a G-Steering trick that reduces the turning circle in off-pavement situations and is good for speeds up to 15 mph, and variable speeds and settings for ""intelligent"" hill ascent and descent. And like the gas-powered G-Class, this EV also gets Mercedes' ""transparent hood"" tech that provides a visualized view of what's under the front of the car, to better navigate those tricky off-road situations.
And since it has no ""engine"" in need of oxygen, the electric G-Class is actually a better off-roader in some ways than its gas-powered counterparts. Its fording depth is rated at 33.5 inches, higher than the G 550 and AMG G63, and it can also climb up to a 100 percent grade on suitable surfaces. Mercedes lists says the EQG is capable of a 32-degree approach angle, 30.7-degree departure angle and 20.3-degree breakover angle, and it has 9.8 inches of ground clearance between the axles.
On the inside, this G-Class is pretty far from a '70s military truck. Screens abound, including a 12.3-inch driver display and 12.3-inch central multimedia display. And if the owner checks the box for it, passengers can watch movies and browse the internet with two integrated 11.6-inch touch displays for the back seat.
Add in the ""G-ROAR"" feature that creates different combustion engine-like sounds, 64 colors for ambient lighting and a special digital cockpit for off-roading, and yes, it's a clear a lot is going on here.
As silly as it is, people love the G-Class; Mercedes has only seen its sales skyrocket upward in recent years, especially the go-fast AMG models. But will those buyers be down to trade their thundering V8 engines for electric power?
If they do, the Edition One Special Edition will be exclusive to the U.S. as a 2025 model year car. It arrives at dealerships in the second half of 2024; pricing will likely be announced closer to its launch.
In the meantime, InsideEVs is due to drive the G580 with EQ Technology next week. We'll let you know if this battery-powered beast can live up to the legend or not.

The Tesla Robotaxi May Be Called The 'Cybercab',https://insideevs.com/news/717207/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-elon-musk/,Elon Musk may have teased the name of its upcoming autonomous vehicle.,4/23/2024 17:46,"Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla's robotaxi will be unveiled in August. Apart from that detail, the vehicle is largely shrouded in mystery.
Now we know at least one thing about it. Well, maybe.
Tesla's Robotaxi Plans
Elon Musk has for years said that autonomous Teslas would someday be able to act as driverless taxis. That future is still most likely a ways off.
During Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, Musk off-handedly called the forthcoming autonomous vehicle ""Cybercab.""
""And as we've announced we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August,"" Musk said on the call.
Was that just him messing around, as he so often does? Or was it actually what Tesla will call the driverless vehicle? So far, that's not clear.
The name would fit in with Tesla's existing nomenclature. Of course, Tesla sells the Cybertruck pickup. It also hawks other cyber-themed merchandise, like CyberBeer and the CyberHammer, all of which have the same brutalist, cyberpunk design as Tesla's truck.
The name would make sense given what we already know about the robotaxi's styling. Walter Isaacson, Elon Musk's biographer, reported last year that the robotaxi will bear a resemblance to the Cybertruck.
""When one of these comes around a corner,"" Musk said upon seeing a model of the robotaxi, according to Isaacson, ""people will think they are seeing something from the future.""
Musk dropped some new details about Tesla's plans for a ride-hailing business during the conference call too. He said that the automaker plans to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis and that Tesla owners will be able to add their cars to the service as they please. Of course, that bold vision depends on whether Tesla actually can succeed in creating an autonomous car. It hasn't managed that yet.

Struggling EV Startup Fisker Could Go Bankrupt Within 30 Days,https://insideevs.com/news/717161/fisker-bankruptcy-30-days/,Things are looking increasingly dire for the California-based electric car company.,4/23/2024 13:24,"Things have gone from bad to worse for Fisker. On Tuesday, the embattled electric vehicle startup announced in a regulatory filing that it expects to file for bankruptcy within the next 30 days if it can't get relief from its creditors or raise some extra cash.
Fisker also said it missed an $8.4 million interest payment in March, leading it to default on that loan. To stave off the worst, the company is cutting costs. In the filing, it said it ""intends to further reduce its workforce and streamline its operations, including reducing its physical footprint.""
Fisker On The Brink
American electric vehicle startup Fisker has been struggling financially for months. It started selling vehicles last year but has had to grapple with problematic vehicles and slow sales.
Fisker has been struggling to stay afloat for some time now. In February, the company said that it could run out of money within 12 months and that it planned to cut 15% of staff. It paused all development of future vehicles and sought a life raft from an established car manufacturer, reportedly Nissan. But those talks ultimately fell through. It was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to an ""abnormally low"" share price.
We Want To Hear From You
Are you a Fisker employee, former employee or owner with information to share? Just want to vent? Contact this reporter at tim.levin.com.
We can keep things anonymous.
To generate as much cash as possible, Fisker slashed prices for the Ocean SUV, its debut product, by up to $24,000. Fisker began delivering its SUV in the U.S. in 2023 but struggled to ramp up sales. On Monday, Fisker also said it had hired a Chief Restructuring Officer in a separate filing.
The company's decline has left Ocean owners in a difficult spot. Their vehicles, some of which cost around $70,000 when new, have depreciated by thousands of dollars virtually overnight. The prospect of bankruptcy raises doubts about whether Ocean drivers will be able to get their vehicles serviced.
While many Ocean owners like their cars, the vehicles have been far from worry-free. Owners told InsideEVs about all sorts of nagging software bugs, as well as more serious issues. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating various problems with the vehicles.
Of course, there's still a chance that Fisker will pull through with the help of some partnership. But the clock is ticking.

BYD Shark Is China’s New Plug-In Hybrid Pickup Truck,https://insideevs.com/news/716991/byd-shark-plug-in-pickup/,The BYD Shark is a plug-in hybrid that may also get a fully electric version at some point.,4/22/2024 15:30,"BYD has confirmed the name of its first plug-in pickup truck that it plans to unveil at the Auto China 2024 expo (the Beijing Motor Show), which starts on Thursday. It will be called the BYD Shark, and at launch, it will be available with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, with the possibility that a fully electric variant will be announced at some point down the line.
The Shark will be about the same size as the Ford Ranger PHEV, which is also its only direct rival since there isn’t another plug-in pickup in this size class available in China, Europe or Australia where it will be sold. BYD has not announced the specifics of the Shark’s powertrain, but it shares its platform with the front-wheel-drive BYD Seal U SUV, which packs a 1.5-liter gasoline engine that, together with an electric motor, makes 194 horsepower.
BYD doesn't plan to sell cars stateside but may build them in Mexico.
BYD is the Chinese automaker that overtook Tesla for total EV sales in Q4 2023 and the Shark is its first plug-in pickup truck.
The Seal U PHEV has an 18.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack that provides up to 68 miles of pure electric driving. There are also two fully electric versions of the Seal U, which are already available in China and will also be introduced in Europe, with 71.8 kWh and 87 kWh battery capacities and claimed WLTP ranges of 260 and 310 miles, respectively.
The Seal U’s charging power peaks at 115 kW, and it supports vehicle-to-load (V2L) bidirectional charging. Sharing its platform with the Seal U, the BYD Shark will likely have identical powertrains and very similar specifications.
BYD also teased the look of the Shark pickup, showing its squared-off design and front daytime running lights, which feature a full-width light bar that connects its headlights. This makes it look a bit like the Ford F-150 Lightning, although the lower part of the headlights’ LED signature is quite different in the BYD.
The Chinese automaker previously showed photos of a fully camouflaged Shark, which gave us a pretty good idea of what the final production vehicle would look like. There isn’t anything particularly unique about the way it looks, and it seems to draw upon elements from other existing pickup designs. Inside, it will feature a 15.6-inch infotainment display powered by an eight-core processor.
BYD has not announced plans to enter the US market, but it already sells cars in Mexico, where it is reportedly considering establishing a manufacturing location. The company wants to build a factory with a yearly output of 150,000 cars that could potentially be exported throughout the Americas.

The New MG Electric Hypercar Hits 62 MPH in 1.9 Seconds,https://www.motor1.com/news/716915/mg-exe-181-concept-debut/,The concept car has an ultra-low drag coefficient of just 0.181.,12/25/2024 9:04,"With the 2024 Auto China show starting later this week, we're in for variety of attention-grabbing concept cars. MG will be in Beijing to showcase the EXE181 concept, an electric hypercar with a single-seat moncoque design. Sitting extremely to the ground, the striking EV looks like one of those Vision Gran Turismo cars.
The teardrop shape contributes to a remarkably low drag coefficient of only 0.181, which is better than the Volkswagen XL1's 0.199 and any other production vehicle. But some concepts were better. The 2022 Mercedes Vision EQXX concept had a Cd of just 0.18, the 2000 General Motors Precept had a drag coefficient of 0.16, and we can't forget about the 1954 Fiat Turbina with a remarkably low 0.14.
Regardless, the new MG EXE181 is a modern-day equivalent of a namesake concept from 1959. The UFO-shaped car before it supposedly had an even lower Cd of 0.12. The ""British"" brand owned by China's SAIC Motor says it's not just one of the most aerodynamic cars out there, but also among the quickest. It needs only 1.9 seconds to reach 62 mph from a standstill.
The Lucid Air Sapphire recently did it in 1.77 seconds, albeit to 60 mph rather than 62 mph and with a one-foot rollout. Last year, the Rimac Nevera took 1.74 seconds to get the job done. Elon Musk promises the new Roadster can reach 60 mph in less than a second but we're honestly finding that hard to believe.
As for top speed, MG doesn't say, but it does mention the EXE181 ""defies the land speed record."" The original concept from the late 1950s managed to reach 254.91 mph with American racing driver Phill Hill behind the wheel.
The extremely tight interior with a center-mounted seat and a racing harness is just as futuristic while reminding us of the single-seat Lamborghini Egoista. The new EXE181 has been envisioned with a yoke incorporating a large screen suggesting the car has four electric motors. Although MG is tight-lipped on other technical specifications, we can safely assume all-wheel drive and a combined output of well over 1,000 horsepower.
The chances of seeing a production version are likely slim to none since this looks more like a spectacular one-off affair to grab the headlines, which it has succeeded.

The 805-HP AMG GT63 S E Performance Is The Quickest Mercedes Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/716809/mercedes-amg-gt-63s-eperformance-debut/,The GT63 S E Performance is the quickest-accelerating production vehicle Mercedes-AMG has ever built.,12/25/2024 9:04,"You knew it was coming. For those who prefer their insane Mercedes-Benz performance cars wearing sleek two-door clothing, you have a new toy. The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door coupe is here, and all indications suggest it was worth the wait.
Those familiar with Mercedes-AMG know E Performance is the company's name for hybrid power. You get 805 combined horsepower in the new GT flagship, courtesy of the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 at the front and an electric motor at the back. The gas burner alone accounts for 603 hp, but arguably the more impressive number is the combined 1,047 pound-feet of torque. With everything working together, Mercedes says the AMG GT63 S E Performance reaches 60 mph in a supercar-beating 2.7 seconds. The new-generation coupe might be bigger with its extra seats, but it's officially the fastest-accelerating AMG production model of them all.
While this is technically a plug-in hybrid, efficiency is not a factor here. The battery capacity is just 6.1 kWh, and Mercedes makes no mention of electric-only range other than to say it will be announced later. Instead, the battery's focus is on performance, and to that end, Mercedes keeps it at an optimal temperature to draw the most power when needed. Charging comes through either a plug or various driver-selectable recuperation settings, including a one-pedal mode similar to an EV.
A nine-speed dual-clutch transmission routes power through Mercedes-AMG's 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system. In normal operation, the electric motor only drives the rear axle, but when slip is detected, power can be routed forward. Rear-axle steering and the AMG Active Ride Control suspension with roll stabilization are standard-issue here, as are carbon ceramic brakes. Six-piston calipers grip 16.5-inch rotors at the front, mounted behind standard-issue 20-inch wheels, while 15-inch rotors with single-piston calipers can be found out back. Optional wheels up to 21 inches are available.
Appearance-wise, you'd be hard-pressed to identify the E Performance version from the standard AMG GT63 unless you get up close. Mercedes adds special badging to the trunk lid, and there's a door hiding a charging port on the rear fascia. Unseen are changes to the active aero system, designed to optimize performance specifically for the hybrid powertrain. In the 2+2 cockpit, it's standard-issue Mercedes-AMG, which means it's not a bad place to be.
Pricing for the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door will be announced closer to its on-sale date in late 2024.

The New BMW i4 Arrives Next Week,https://www.motor1.com/news/716539/2025-bmw-i4-debut-date/,The BMW Group will bring the new i4 and Mini Aceman to the Auto China show.,12/25/2024 9:04,"With BMW offering such a vast lineup, there's always a new model around the corner. After introducing the updated 4 Series Coupe and Convertible in late January, the i4 will break cover next week. The electric 4er is going to celebrate its world premiere in Beijing at Auto China alongside the Mini Aceman.
BMW only mentions the i4, without the 4 Series Gran Coupe upon which the EV is based. It's unclear whether the model with combustion engines will be there as well. Spy shots of the zero-emission model have revealed redesigned headlights with boomerang-shaped elements inherited from the recently updated two-door 4 Series models. The front bumper will also adopt a fresh, albeit busy look.
It's too soon to say whether the 2025 BMW i4 is getting those cool laser taillights we saw on the 4 Series Coupe/Convertible. The M4 CSL had them first a couple of years ago, and so did the ultra-exclusive 3.0 CSL. They're now trickling down to the lesser 4 Series/M4 models.
Inside, the flat-bottomed steering wheel we saw on the ICE-powered, two-door models could come to the i4 as well. In addition, BMW is likely to transition the EV to its latest infotainment system, the iDrive 8.5. We're also expecting slightly revised central air vents surrounded by contour ambient lighting–as seen on the 2025 4 Series Coupe/Convertible.
Joining the i4 in China will be the Aceman, Mini's first electric-only model. Positioned below the Countryman, the new subcompact crossover is going to be built locally by Spotlight Automotive. It’s a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group and Great Wall Motor. The electric three-door hatch is also made there at a new factory in Zhangjiagang, China. The two EVs will also be assembled at home in Oxford, UK from 2026.
Auto China 2024 starts April 25 with the first press day. However, the BMW Group Night event is scheduled a day before, on April 24.

The maxed-out Sierra EV will deliver 10% more range, 500 more pounds of towing capacity and 150 more pounds of payload capacity, all while costing $9,200 less than originally announced.
At the same time, the price of the fully loaded electric Sierra EV has gone down by $9,200. According to GMC, the final MSRP of the truck is $99,495 including the destination charge.

The changes are similar to those applied to the Sierra EV’s Chevrolet cousin, the Silverado EV in top RST trim, which got a bump in range and a price cut of $10,000 compared to the initial specs. Both GM-made electric pickups are scheduled for delivery this summer.
In the EV truck space, the range king is currently the Chevy Silverado EV 4WT, which can go 450 miles on a full charge, followed by the Silverado EV RST and GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 with 440 miles of range. The Rivian R1T Dual-Motor with the Max Pack battery can travel up to 410 miles, the GMC Hummer EV 3X has an estimated maximum range of 381 miles, while the Tesla Cybertruck AWD has a manufacturer-estimated range of 340 miles.
In the case of the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, everything else stays the same. It will be available in limited numbers as a luxury-oriented vehicle with four-wheel steering, including the CrabWalk feature that originally debuted on the GMC Hummer EV. This allows the vehicle to travel diagonally at low speeds, helping the driver avoid obstacles while driving off-road.
The 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 comes with a pair of electric motors that deliver a total output of 754 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque when the so-called Max Power mode is activated.
Official details about the truck’s battery pack are not yet available, but the Sierra EV will likely use the same 800-volt, 24-module pack as the GMC Hummer EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV to achieve its range estimate. As for recharging, the Sierra EV is capable of accepting up to 350 kW from a compatible fast charger, enabling it to add about 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.
The Hummer EV’s more affordable brother also boasts a 19.2 kW onboard AC charger and the ability to export 10.2 kW of power through 10 outlets scattered across the pickup for things like tools or appliances.
The 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 also comes as standard with the MultiPro Midgate, which means the divider between the passenger compartment and the bed can be folded. With both the midgate and the tailgate open, the Sierra EV can carry items that are nearly 11 feet long in the bed.
Air suspension is also standard, while Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free advanced driver assistance system, will be available as an option.",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore: Finally, A New Convertible EV",https://insideevs.com/news/716180/2025-maserati-grancabrio-folgore-reveal/,"Weighting only 176 pounds more than the coupe version, the Cabriolet is expected to perform like its hardtop sibling.",4/15/2024 16:03,"At last, electric horsepower with some wind in your hair to go with it.
Today in the seaside town of Rimini, Italy, Maserati unveiled its latest all-electric machine: the long-awaited GranCabrio Folgore. Claiming the title “first luxury EV convertible,"" the GranCabrio Folgore made its debut with the usual Maserati panache, including a celebrity Italian DJ.
The Italian brand is serious about this vehicle. Boasting 800-volt technology and developed with technology reportedly cribbed from Formula E, the GranCabrio Folgore appears to be lightning fast and sleek and we’re looking forward to driving it in the near future. It’s part of Maserati’s plan to electrify its entire lineup by 2028, a timeline that was moved up from 2030 earlier this year.
The cabriolet version of the brand’s first EV, the GranTurismo Folgore, shares many of the same attributes as its hardtop sibling. Design differences between the coupe and the convertible are slim, in fact. Engineering is also nearly identical, boasting three 300-kilowatt permanent magnet motors and 800-volt technology for fast charging.
Head of design Klaus Busse has been with the Italian brand since 2015 and says the journey to electrification started eight years ago. Incidentally (or ironically, considering his size), the 6’7” designer also penned Fiat’s tiny 500e, which was just released in the North American market. Conversely, the GranCabrio offers generous seating for four average-sized adults.
Busse said he didn’t want the GranCabrio EV to be a “faceless car,” opting to invert the convex grille so that it has a distinct look for the EV lineup and promotes air cooling but maintains the Maserati feel. In essence, the solid bars represented on the gas-powered Maserati models are open vents instead, so it looks familiar but different.
Speaking of familiar but different, Maserati’s V8 is dying this year, which could mean the end of its trademark soundtrack. To perhaps tempt buyers who want to keep the vroom-vroom noises of a Maserati gas-powered engine, the brand’s Innovation Lab created a 3D sound system designed to emulate the rumbles of the ICE version.
Trident engineers mapped the frequencies of the eight-cylinder roar and digitized it for its Folgore lineup, feeding it through one of two audio systems by Italian speaker manufacturer Sonus Faber. In standard format, the audio system includes 13 speakers and 2D surround, with an 815-watt output; upgrade to the 16-speaker system for 2D and 3D surround sound with amplification up to 1060 watts.
Weighing in at more than 5,100 pounds, the convertible rides on a platform adaptable to ICE or EV, herefitted with a “T-Bone” battery pack. Impressively, the designers say no power is sacrificed at the droptop altar, and the difference in weight between the GranTurismo Folgore and GranCabrio Folgore is a mere 176 pounds. The automaker says it looked at the entirety of the vehicle, including its interior materials, to ensure the difference was slight.
Similarly to Audi’s S5 Cabriolet, the GranCabrio Folgore’s soft top can be opened even while driving up to about 31 mph. In 14 seconds, the car is converted to an open-air vehicle (and 16 seconds to close). Also like the S5 convertible, the GranCabrio Folgore includes neck warmers to keep the driver and front passenger comfortable with the top down.
The new GranCabrio Folgore can run in four drive modes: Max Range, GT, Sport, and Corsa. Max Range saves the most battery, and Maserati recommends running this mode when the power level dips below 16 percent. Maximum speed is throttled down to 80 mph and limits climate control as well. GT is touring mode for long drives, and both power and sound are decreased to 80 percent. Sport is for spirited driving, and Corsa offers up the whole cannoli (because “the whole enchilada” doesn’t work as well for an Italian car) of power.
Like the newest Ram 1500 pickup truck in the Stellantis lineup, Maserati’s new EV is built with the Atlantis High electrical architecture, previously seen in the GranTurismo. Equipped with “advanced cyber-security and flash-over-the-air features,” the EV convertible uses Maserati-designed software.
Available in 27 special Folgore finishes and the option to customize the GranCabrio through Maserati’s bespoke program, the GranCabrio includes six different wheel designs. The wheels are staggered, with 21-inch rims in the back and 20-inch versions up front. Inside, the brand continues to use recycled materials made from nylon waste from fishing nets and carpeting.
It remains to be seen if Maserati customers will embrace the EV technology in the lineup. With a $200,000 to $205,000 starting price that’s similar to its gas-powered cars and a soundtrack to ease buyers into the EV transition, it has a fighting chance and it sure looks tempting. Ciao bella, indeed.

Alfa Romeo Milano Now Named ‘Junior’ Because Of Italian Law Protecting Cheese,https://insideevs.com/news/716161/alfa-romeo-junior-rename-milano/,"The car will be built in Poland, not Italy, which means it’s not allowed to bear an Italian-sounding name.",4/15/2024 13:30,"Remember the Alfa Romeo Milano we wrote about last week? It’s the Italian carmaker’s first-ever series-production electric vehicle, so it’s a pretty big deal. Except it’s not called “Milano” anymore because Italy decided against that, and an obscure law originally designed for protecting cheese is to blame.
Alfa, which is owned by Stellantis, announced that its new entry-level subcompact crossover will now be called the Junior because it doesn’t want to get into a fight with the Italian government. The ""Milano"" name goes against a law that was designed to protect Italian-sounding names for products that are made in Italy, like Parmigiano cheese.
No Milano for you!
Just like the rather selective soup maker who made an appearance on the 1990s hit TV series Seinfeld, the Italian government forced Alfa Romeo to rename its new ""Milano"" crossover to ""Junior"" because it won't be made in Italy despite having an Italian-sounding name.
The problem is that the Milano—sorry, the Junior—will be built in Poland, making the original name in violation of the law in Italy.
“A car called Milano cannot be produced in Poland. This is forbidden by Italian law,” said Adolfo Urso, Italy’s Minister of Economic Development, referring to 2003 legislation that targets “Italian sounding” products that falsely claim to be Italian.
More Alfa Romeo News
According to Reuters, this law has been typically invoked in the past by the Italian government against food products like U.S.-made “parmesan” cheese which resembles Italy’s Parmigiano.
The rest stays the same. The Alfa Romeo Junior is based on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger and, just like its American counterpart, it won’t make its way to the United States anytime soon. It’s available as either an all-electric model with up to 240 horsepower or a hybrid with 136 hp.
Alfa Romeo said that despite believing the “Milano” name “met all legal requirements and that there are issues much more important than the name of the car,” it decided to change the entry model’s name to “Junior” in the spirit of mutual understanding.
I don’t know about you, but to me that seems like a major slip-up for a company that’s based in Italy.",Iulian Dnistran
The Alfa Romeo Milano Is A Small Crossover With Up To 254 Miles Of WLTP EV Range,https://insideevs.com/news/715724/alfa-romeo-milano-ev-official-specs-details-range/,It sits on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger.,4/11/2024 13:00,"Update: Alfa Romeo renamed the Milano to ""Junior."" The original story follows below.
After the demise of the combustion-powered Alfa Romeo Mito subcompact hatchback in 2018, the Italian automaker that made a reputation for itself by offering some of the most stylish cars on the market had a hole in its portfolio.
That hole has now been filled with the launch of the new Alfa Romeo Milano, a B-segment crossover that’s based on the same e-CMP2 platform as the Jeep Avenger and Fiat 600.
Alfa Romeo's new urban crossover is also its first EV
The new Alfa Romeo Milano ushers in a new era for the Italian automaker. It's the first-ever all-electric car made by Alfa and a new entry-level model at the same time, slotting under the Tonale crossover.
Just like its Stellantis relatives, the new Alfa Romeo Milano will be available as either an EV or a hybrid that combines a 1.2-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged engine with a 48-volt lithium-ion battery and a 21-kilowatt (28-horsepower) electric motor integrated into the six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In total, the hybrid Milano makes 136 hp.
More Alfa Romeo Stories
The all-electric version of Alfa’s subcompact crossover goes by the “Elettrica” moniker and is powered by a 54-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a maximum combined driving range of 254 miles on a full charge on the WLTP cycle.
Two versions of the Milano EV are offered. The base model has a 156 hp front-mounted electric motor, while the go-faster Veloce trim ups the output to 240 hp, but the car remains front-wheel drive. Alfa Romeo said that an all-wheel drive version will be available sometime in the future, but only on the hybrid.
Besides getting more power, the Milano Veloce benefits from “extra sporty” front and rear anti-roll bars, a 0.98-inch lower suspension compared to the base version, big brakes, 20-inch high-performance tires and the same limited-slip differential as in the upcoming Abarth 600e. Alfa Romeo says that the Milano also has the most direct steering in the segment.
Charging the diminutive EV can be done from a DC source at up to 100 kW, with the Italian automaker saying that going from 10% to 80% state of charge takes less than 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the on-board three-phase charger is rated at 11 kW.
Designed by Alfa Romeo’s Centro Stile in Turin, Italy, the Milano features a rather aggressive front fascia encompassing a so-called “3+3” headlight system with adaptive full LED Matrix lights. On the electric version, the grille features the company’s logo cut into it, while the hybrid variant has a more traditional grille with the Alfa Romeo script.
Alfa Romeo Milano hybrid
Alfa Romeo Milano EV
The Milano measures 164.1 inches long, 70 inches wide and 59 inches tall, putting it in the same league, size-wise, as the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV, which is roughly three inches taller than Alfa’s crossover.
Unlike the Bolt EV, however, the Milano will be strictly a European affair, with no plans to bring the souped-up hatchback stateside.
Inside, the new Alfa Romeo features two 10.25-inch screens, one that acts as a digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel and a touchscreen that’s the gateway to the car’s infotainment system. In the EV, the infotainment is connected to the internet and provides real-time information about over 600,000 charging stations across Europe.
The Italian automaker claims the Milano has the biggest trunk in its class–that’s the B segment EV class–with 14.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. There’s also a charging cable storage bay under the hood, a 180-degree rear camera and all-around parking sensors, as well as a series of advanced driver assistance features that translate into a Level 2-capable vehicle.
In Europe, customers of the Alfa Romeo Milano Elettrica will get a complimentary Wallbox charger from Free2Move plus an E-card that can be used for contactless payments at charging stations.
Pricing hasn’t been officially announced yet, but company boss Jean-Philippe Imparato hinted for Autocar that the Milano will start at around €30,000 in Italy.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Will Race at Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/715558/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-pikes-peak/,The hot EV will lose the rear seats in exchange for a roll cage.,12/25/2024 9:04,"Hyundai wants to show off the Ioniq 5 N's performance chops by bringing four examples of the hot EV to this year's Pikes Peak. The 102th running of the hill climb event takes place June 23 and will feature two production-spec vehicles along with a couple of modified cars. The standard ones won't be truly stock either since some tweaks will be made inside.
Going after the electric production SUV/crossover record, the two Ioniq 5 Ns won't have rear seats. Not because Hyundai wants to make the vehicles lighter but safer by adding a roll cage in the back. In addition, the driver's seat is replaced by a Recaro Pro Racer SPA Hans seat with a six-point Sabelt racing harness compatible with HANS (head and neck support). In case something goes awry, there's going to be a fire suppression system.
Other than these modifications, the Ioniq 5 N will be completely stock. It'll carry over the dual-motor setup from the road-going model, complete with up to 641 horsepower when overboost is active. In regular mode, the total system output is still a massive 601 hp. Hyundai touts a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.25 seconds with launch control and the extra temporary power. Flat out, top speed is electronically capped at 162 mph.
Eleven-time PPIHC winner Paul Dallenbach will hunt for records in one of the two ""stock"" Ioniq 5 Ns. The other one will be driven by rookie Ron Zaras, a former Hoonigan executive. As for the two modified vehicles, these will be piloted by WRC driver Dani Sordo and four-time overall winner and King of the Mountain title holder at Pikes Peak Robin Shute. The two will perform a test ahead of the grueling 24 Hours of Nürburgring set for May 30.
Hyundai is already evaluating the Ioniq 5 N at Pikes Peak, but the speedy EV will adopt an N livery instead of this red finish for the actual race in Colorado. The four vehicles are going to tackle the 12.42-mile course with no fewer than 156 turns. All drivers will go through an elevation gain of 4,725 feet, crossing the finish line at 14,115 feet above sea level.
The outright record at Pikes Peak belongs to Romain Dumas in the Volkswagen I.D. R with a time of 7 minutes and 57.148 seconds established in 2018. It's safe to assume the Ioniq 5 N won't get anywhere close since the VW was a purpose-built electric race car.

Updated 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQS Tones Down Looks And Goes Farther,https://insideevs.com/news/715669/2025-eqs-update-mercedes-benz/,Flush-mounted chrome bars on the front of the EQS usher in a traditional look for the radically-styled sedan.,4/10/2024 14:56,"The Mercedes-Benz EQS’s smooth, ovoid shape may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the brand has put effort into making it even more competitive for 2025. A new grille, the return of a traditional Mercedes-Benz styling feature, and revised under-the-skin electric components should make the EQS fight that much harder in an increasingly competitive big luxury EV sedan market.
The most obvious change to the 2025 EQS, is its front grille and new Mercedes-Benz standing star logo. Of course, it still has the same black panel shape that’s inherent to the rest of the Mercedes-Benz EV lineup, but the grille’s insert now resembles the chrome-crosshaired versions we’ve seen on its gas-powered cars. The emblem is now mounted standing up, like other big sedans of the brand. The new EQS also has a standard AMG-line front bumper, further enhancing the car’s visual aesthetic.
Mercedes Benz EV Plans Might Be Wavering
Mercedes-Benz remains committed to going electric, but lately, it has pulled back on its EV plans. Recently, it admitted that it will keep making ICE vehicles, but it does plan for 50% of its sales to be fully electric by the end of the decade.
The interior is mostly the same, meaning, EQS drivers will still have the dashboard-spanning Hyperscreen taking up most of the interior. But, there have been minor tweaks to make the car even more luxurious than before. Mercedes-Benz has added a bit more padding to the rear seats and enshrouded the B-pillar rear air vents in chrome. All EQSs now have a rear seat with adjustable recline, but the ones in Pinnacle trim and the Executive Interior Package allow the front passenger seat to fold, and increase the rear bench’s recline ability to a full 37 degrees, up from 27 to 36 degrees on the standard EQS. The Executive Interior Package also adds rapid heating, a pair of pillows, and neck and shoulder heating.
Underneath, the battery is all new and has more energy. Mercedes-Benz claims the EQS is now rated for 118 kWh and can go farther, albeit it hasn’t shared the so-called updated range figures. The regenerative braking software has been recalibrated, too. The EQS now uses more regenerative braking, but will also periodically use its friction brakes so they can stay in good shape.
The official range, pricing, and specifications specific to our market will come before the 2025 EQS reaches dealerships in late 2024.

The Electric Mercedes G-Class Is Called G580 With EQ Technology,https://www.motor1.com/news/715396/mercedes-g580-eq-technology/,It debuts at Auto China this month together with several other premieres.,12/25/2024 9:04,"At long last, the electric Mercedes-Benz G-Class finally has a name. Contrary to reports indicating the off-roader would be the first model to drop the EQ branding, the two letters are sticking around. But rather than being called EQG like the concept, the production version will be known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" when it debuts this month at Auto China in Beijing.
Since it's called the ""G580,"" we can safely assume that it has more power than the G550. For the 2025 model year, the regular G-Class loses its V-8 in favor of a mild-hybrid, inline-six engine that makes 443 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. We reckon the electric G is not going to outpunch the AMG G63, which keeps the V-8 packing 577 hp and 627 lb-ft.
The electric G-Class is expected to have four motors—one at each wheel—and a battery capacity estimated at 100.0-kilowatt-hours. That should give it a range of over 200 miles, which isn’t ideal, but not surprising since it'll be a heavy SUV. An optional high-density battery pack benefitting from silicon anode chemistry is due in 2025. We also know it'll have 32-degree approach and 35-degree departure angles, along with 9.8 inches of ground clearance.
The G580 with EQ Technology won't be the first quad-motor EV from Mercedes since that title goes to the SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012. It's going to need all the power it can get considering G brand boss Emmerich Schiller has said it'll weigh less than 7,716 pounds.
An updated EQS will also attend the 2024 Auto China where the luxury brand intends to unveil (takes a deep breath) the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance with a plug-in hybrid V-8 setup. Without going into details, the three-pointed star mentions new show premieres from Maybach and the E-Class lineup will be there as well.
We'll first see the GT63 S E Performance on April 20 during the AMG Brand Night Event in Shanghai during the Chinese F1 weekend while the electric G premieres on April 24. Auto China starts April 25 with the first press day.

The Updated 2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E Is Now Available For Online Order,https://insideevs.com/news/715506/update-mache-ford-2024-online/,"The updated Mach-E is quicker, has more range and the lineup is simpler.",4/9/2024 13:30,"Ford’s turning up the heat on its compact EV crossover, the Mustang Mach-E. Equipped with better charging times, more choices, and more range, Ford is setting up the car to fight hard against competitors like the Tesla Model Y.  Oh, and the internet-breaking Mach-E Rally edition is finally available for order.
For 2024, Ford’s updates to the Mustang Mach-E have been more related to under the skin, and trim streamlining, rather than a full visual update. The Mach E still comes in four trims, Select, Premium, GT, and now the new Mustang Mach-E Rally trim. The California Route-1 trim has been cut for 2024.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E is starting to pick up sales
The Ford Mustang Mach-E is a solid EV option, yet it has not sold nearly as well as cars like the Tesla Model Y. Price cuts, and now an update should help the Mach-E sell better.
All Mustang Mach-E trims get a bump in range, and improvement in charging ability, and the Performance upgrade-equipped models are even faster than before. Ford spokesperson Emma Berg says much of these improvements are directly due to Ford’s new in-house developed rear e-motor, which is now equipped on all Mach-E models for 2024. This new e-motor is lighter than the old one and has more torque (up to 100 ft-lbs more). Also, Ford’s improved powertrain control management allows for better charge times. This all sounds like a win for the Mustang Mach-E.
On paper, those changes appear to have paid off. The 2024 Mach-E gains a notable bump in range. Ford says that all Mach-E models have a 10 to 20-mile bump in range for 2024. The RWD Premium models now are comfortably above the magical 300-mile range threshold; at 320 miles, the new Mach E’s improved range should keep range anxiety at bay here.
Arguably, the most exciting updates to the Mustang Mach-E are its performance-oriented updates. The GT trim is no longer a two-tier affair, as the old GT Performance Edition package’s upgrades have just been standardized on the regular GT. Now, all GT models will have the sport seats, MagneRide Damping System, and Brembo brake calipers.
But, for 2024, there is a new Performance upgrade software upgrade that can make the GT model even faster than it already is. When installed on the Mach-E GT, it will slingshot the car from 0-60 in as little as 3.3 seconds, down from 3.8 seconds. Ford says is quicker than the Tesla Model Y Performance and the Porsche Macan 4 Electric. The quarter-mile happens in a blisteringly quick 11.8 seconds. This is all possible due to the new rear e-motor. When coupled with the front motor, the Mach-E can generate a staggering 700 ft-lbs of torque. This unlockable feature is either $995 when purchased alone, or $795 when purchased alongside the the new bronze appearance package, which is $1,995. Like other software-based upgrades, Ford says the upgrade can be purchased and seamlessly integrated at a later date.
The cream of the crop is now the Mustang Mach-E Rally. Basically, Ford’s taken the already good Mach-E GT (with the optional Performance Upgrade installed), raised it by an inch and decked it out with a fleet of rally-inspired off-road kit. These upgrades do take their toll on the range. The Mach-E Rally can only manage 265 miles, despite having the same battery as the range-leading, 320-mile range Mach-E Premium (RWD).
Pricing is simpler for 2024, too. The Mach-E standard range Select RWD trim starts at $41,890 and tops out at $48,890 for the extended-range AWD variant. The Mach-E Premium Standard range RWD starts at $45,890 and stops at $51,890 for the extended-range AWD model. The GT model is $55,890 not including options like the Bronze appearance package or the Performance upgrade. Finally, the Rally trim tops out at $61,890. All of these prices include the $1,895 destination fee. Unfortunately, the Mach-E does not qualify for the IRA’s EV tax credit when purchased, but it may qualify via a lease.
The 2024 Mustang Mach-E lineup is now available to order online.

"Elon Musk Says Tesla Robotaxi Will Be Revealed On August 8, 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/715166/elon-musk-posts-tesla-robotaxi-unveil-date/,"The news follows a report that a planned ""affordable Tesla"" project is dead.",4/5/2024 17:14,"After today's drama with Reuters announcing that the $25,000 affordable Tesla was dead, and CEO Elon Musk responding by saying that the report was a lie, there’s a new development. Just hours later, Musk posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the autonomous Tesla Robotaxi will be revealed on August 8, 2024.
It goes without mentioning that this is a monumental development. Its roots were sown in 2016 when Tesla first revealed plans to make a self-driving people carrier. Details have mostly been scarce. But a ""Robotaxi Concept"" featured in Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, along with some early sketches of a ""gen 3"" vehicle.
The Tesla Robotaxi is happening.
Elon Musk has raved about Tesla's robotaxi for years. A cutting-edge self-driving people carrier that would revolutionize mobility, in his view. It was also one of the reasons that investors were betting big on Tesla. We didn't know if it ever would become a reality, but now Musk has put a date on it. It's arriving this summer, folks.
According to the book, Musk was adamant about creating an autonomous robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel. But his deputies persuaded him to develop an affordable ""global car"" to drive the brand towards achieving a lofty 50% annual growth target, without challenging his stance.
We've known for a while that the robotaxi and the affordable mass-market EV have the same platform. But little is known about the overlap between the two in terms of design and engineering. With the robotaxi's reveal announced before the affordable Tesla, it's unclear if the latter will ever be a reality—especially since sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the low-cost family car has been scrapped.
Messaging from the company remains muddled and confusing. Two years ago, Tesla executives hinted that the affordable EV might arrive before the robotaxi. But the man at the top might have pulled rank to reverse that possibility.
Either way, Musk's big announcement was probably in response to the Reuters report from this morning. We don't know for sure, but soon after his post, Tesla stock climbed some 3% after dipping earlier in the day.
The next-generation Tesla would be critical for the company since investors have been weary about the brand's business lately. Tesla share prices have been down some 33% since the start of the year. The company's Q1 sales were largely underwhelming, showing the first negative decline in years. The threat of rivals catching up and cheap Chinese EVs penetrating the U.S. looms large.
To tackle this storm, several experts have said the $25,000 EV should have arrived even before the Cybertruck—a hulking steel triangle that isn't exactly designed to democratize EVs. But it seems like Musk is going ahead with the robotaxi plan. How that pans out for the brand is something we'll know in a few months.

And here it is.
The car, a 2014 Model S P85, has racked up 1.2 million miles so far, which works out to approximately 131,000 miles per year. Could you imagine driving that much? And doing so in an electric car, which naysayers often state can't go the distance?
(UPDATE: This Model S has now surpassed 2 million kilometers, which is about 1.24 million miles.)
Well, we think this car proves that EVs can be driven a significant amount of miles per year and that the charging infrastructure, at least in some parts of the world, can support high-mileage drives.
More High Mileage Teslas
Back in 2019, Elon Musk congratulated Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg, the owner of this particular Model S, which at the time had one million kilometers (621,371 miles) on its odometer. That seemed like a solid accomplishment but flash forward to today and the mileage has basically doubled.
The video embedded above is one of the first to feature Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg. Up until now, much of the info about Gemmingen-Hornberg's Model S was limited to tweets. As Watt Energy, the uploader of the video explains:
His car has 1.9 million km / or 1.18 million miles on the odometer at the time of filming and Hansjorg aims for more. There is little precise information about him online, mostly based on some older tweets or on assumptions of how he manages to put so many miles on his car. I went to Germany to meet Hansjörg directly and to find out the complete story firsthand from him!
There's a lot more to the story though. Gemmingen-Hornberg previously owned a Tesla Roadster. He managed to somehow rack up 400,000 miles on it, despite the lacking infrastructure at the time. He decided to buy the Model S shortly after it came out because it was roomier and more comfortable. However, he didn't buy a new Model S, but rather a used 2014 one with 18,641 miles on it.
Some early Tesla Model S EVs were known to have issues with their rear motors. This particular Tesla suffered from this. The rear motor was replaced thirteen times, so if we include the original that it came with, that's fourteen motors over the course of 1.2 million miles.
Most of the replacement motors were actually refurbished units and the problem there is that Tesla didn't know the real issue so it didn't know how to properly fix the motors. Some of these replacement motors failed very quickly. Some were covered under warranty, while others were not.
In regards to the vehicle's battery pack, it fared better than the motor. However, this Model S is currently on its fourth battery pack. Four batteries at 1.2 million miles mean that the average pack lasted some 300,000 and counting, which is actually a strong showing in our opinion.
More Battery Degradation And Charging Info
Gemmingen-Hornberg notes that he does take it easy in his Model S. He does not drive the car for long distances without giving it and himself a break. He says he only covers about 62 miles at a time before pausing for a while.
In regard to depleting and charging the battery, the Model S owner says he aims to recharge it when it drops down to 20 percent. He doesn't fully deplete the battery and also doesn't top it off.
The other aspects of the car, like the exterior and interior, have held up well. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into detail about other wear items like brakes, tires, and so on.
For starters, the owner is retired. He also likes to see the world by car. The Model S has been driven to Africa, Morocco, Sweden, Austria, and China. It seems that's only the beginning though. The Model S owner wants to continue driving the car and actually let go of his Lucid Air reservation so that the Model S can rack up even more miles.

Ford Delays EV Pickup And Three-Row Electric SUV To Focus On Hybrids,https://insideevs.com/news/714959/ford-delays-electric-three-row-suv-by-two-years/,Ford said the delay would allow the company to take advantage of advancements in battery technology.,4/4/2024 9:42,"Ford has delayed the plans to build its next-generation EVs. Production of the electric pickup codenamed ""Project T3"" has been postponed from 2025 to 2026. The three-row electric SUV, which Ford CEO Jim Farley once described as a ""personalized bullet train,"" is now slated to arrive by 2027, instead of 2025.
The Dearborn automaker said additional time was required to let the EV market mature. In the meantime, Ford said it would benefit from the ongoing advancements in battery technology.
More Delays At Ford
Ford's EVs are flying off the shelves, especially the Mustang Mach-E. But the brand is cautious about its next-generation line-up. As the EPA regulations now allow a more gradual transition to EVs, automakers are using this additional timeframe to let the market evolve.
Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EV and digital systems indicated last year that the family SUV would arrive by 2025 with 350 miles of range. It would be an Explorer-sized EV made in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. The electric pickup truck, meanwhile, will be made at the BlueOval City plant in West Tennessee.
The family SUV is not to be mixed with the Explorer that's currently on sale in Europe—that one is based on Volkswagen's modular electric drive toolkit, commonly known as the MEB platform. Ford's family SUV for North America will be based on a bespoke BEV native platform.
Production of the gas-powered Edge SUVs will end next month at the Ontario plant and it will undergo retooling to make the family SUV. However, the delay would extend the layoffs of some 2,700 workers.
""We value our Canadian workforce and appreciate that this delay will have an impact on the team. The company will work with Unifor [the labor union] to mitigate the impact the launch delay will have on its workforce at Oakville,"" Ford said in the announcement.
Ford said it would continue focusing on its existing line-up of gas, hybrid, PHEV and BEV line-up in the meantime, contingent on demand. There's also a range of affordable EVs on the way under what Ford calls a ""skunkworks"" project.
""We are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time,” Farley said. “Our breakthrough, next-generation EVs will be new from the ground up and fully software enabled, with ever-improving digital experiences and a multitude of potential services,” he added.
Currently, there are several three-row electric SUVs on sale in the U.S. Some options include the Tesla Model Y and X, the newly launched Kia EV9, the Rivian R1S and the Mercedes EQB and EQS SUVs.
Many more are in the pipeline, including the production version of Toyota's ""bZ large SUV"" concept that will be manufactured in Kentucky, the Volvo EX90, Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Lucid Gravity among others.

Abarth 600e Is A Formula-E Inspired 240 HP Electric Hot Hatch,https://insideevs.com/news/714560/abarth-fiat-600e-formulae-hatch/,Stellantis says this is the most powerful car to ever wear the Abarth badge.,4/1/2024 15:30,"We’ve known about Fiat’s (Abarth) pint-sized four-door hot EV for a short while, but the brand has blessed us this week with more photos and details. This 240-horsepower EV crossover is aimed at the heart of the ever-changing sport compact hatchback and crossover classes. Could it be North America bound?
The Abarth 600e is strikingly sporty. It has a big wing, chunky wheels, and fun graphics that make it look just as rowdy as its Abarth 500e sibling. All of the photos are from the 600e Scorpionissima, which is a purple-painted commemoration of Abarth’s 75th anniversary. Only 1949 units of this model will be produced.
Fiat Aims To Go Fully Electric
Fiat aims to go fully electric by 2030. In North America, the imported Fiat 500e is part of its new push to revitalize sales in North America. Fiat plans to grow its presence in North America with more models and nameplates from other parts of the world.
Like the standard Fiat 600e, the Abarth 600e uses the same e-CMP platform that underpins many small subcompact hatchbacks and crossovers in the Stellantis stable including the Opel Corsa, Jeep Avenger, and Peugeot 2008. But, Abarth has significantly turned up the heat. Gone is the 156 horsepower front motor, replaced with a much larger 240 horsepower unit. That extra power is managed via a mechanical limited-slip differential and formula-E-inspired tires. This is the most powerful EV Stellantis has introduced yet on the e-CMP platform, and the most powerful product to ever wear an Abarth badge.
Abarth has also released photos of the interior, too. Of course, it’s very similar inside to the standard 600e (and has shades of the Jeep Avenger), but Abarth-specific graphics and Alcantara add to the car’s sporty demeanor. The infotainment screen has special Abarth graphics.
It’s still very much up in the air if the Fiat (or Abarth) 600e is bound for North America. On paper, the 600e’s specifications could seem a bit iffy, the standard 600e is only good for 250 miles on the somewhat forgiving WLTP cycle from a relatively small 54 kWh battery. With the extra power and focus on performance, the Abarth 600e’s range will likely be even lower, for a car that doesn’t even sound all that powerful on paper.
However, power and range aren’t always the end-all, and be-all when it comes to creating a desirable EV. The Abarth 600e could be charming, most of its manufacturer photos show the car doing front-wheel-drive slides, indicating that Fiat and Abarth are aiming to create a fun-to-drive car. It even has the same external sound generator as the Abarth 500e, meant to inject some personality into the EV driving experience.
We do know that Fiat has plans to expand its US lineup sooner rather than later. Hopefully, the Abarth 600e, or something like it, will make its way here.

Volvo’s Last Diesel Car Is Headed Straight To A Museum,https://insideevs.com/news/714134/volvo-last-diesel-xc90/,Volvo just hit a major milestone on its path to electric-only sales by 2030.,3/27/2024 18:26,"Volvo just made its last car with a diesel engine, marking a big milestone in the Swedish company's march toward electric-only sales.
The vehicle, an XC90 SUV, rolled off the assembly line in Torslanda, Sweden and is headed to a Volvo museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, where the automaker is headquartered.
Volvo says goodbye to diesel
Volvo plans to pivot to electric-only sales by 2030. Look out for it to release two brand-new electric models in the U.S. this year: the EX30 compact SUV and the larger EX90.
Several of the world's automakers have pared back their electric ambitions in recent months, citing a slowdown in EV demand. Mercedes-Benz, for example, now aims for 50% of its sales to be electric or hybrid by 2030, five years later than it initially planned. Despite the doom and gloom hanging over the EV market over the last several months, the auto industry's zero-emission transition is chugging along when you take a longer view.
Milestones like Volvo's show exactly where things are heading thanks to tightening environmental regulations globally and growing consumer interest in EVs. Diesel cars took off in Europe, promising lower greenhouse gas emissions than ones powered by gasoline. However, diesel sales have steadily declined in recent years as EVs gained traction.
The majority of cars Volvo sold in Europe in 2019 ran on diesel, the automaker said. Now, hybrid and fully electric cars account for most of its European sales. The company's EV sales grew by 70% last year. Volvo aims to be an electric-only carmaker by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.
Those plans are taking shape in the U.S. with the help of two exciting new EVs coming this year. The EX30 is a compact SUV starting at roughly $35,000, cheaper than most EVs. The EX90 will provide an electric alternative to Volvo's best-selling XC90 midsize SUV.
Similarly, Dodge recently said goodbye to its bread-and-butter V8s, turning its focus to electric cars and more fuel-efficient six-cylinder engines.

"The 2025 Volkswagen ID.7 Gets Two Trims, Both RWD And AWD, For U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/714095/2025-volkswagen-id7-trims/,Still no word on pricing or range yet.,3/27/2024 17:00,"Volkswagen announced the offer structure for the 2025 ID.7 model in the United States, which will join the ID.4 in the second half of 2024.
The Volkswagen ID.7 will be positioned in the near-luxury sedan segment and offered in two trims—Pro S and Pro S Plus. There will be only one battery option (82 kilowatt-hours of total capacity) and two powertrain versions: rear-wheel drive and dual-motor, all-wheel drive.
Volkswagen expands EV lineup
Volkswagen's EV lineup in the U.S. currently consists of only the ID.4, but shortly, it will be joined by the ID.7 and ID. Buzz. This should allow the company to continue to increase all-electric car sales.
This means that there will be four main versions of the Volkswagen ID.7 on the market:
Pricing and EPA range estimates will be announced closer to launch in Q3 2024. What we do know is that in Europe, the 82-kWh battery gets up to 386 miles of WLTP range. In the U.S., the EPA Combined range might reach about 300 miles, at least in the RWD version. Meanwhile, prices potentially could start at under $60,000.
The AWD version with Volkswagen's latest APP 550 drive unit is expected to accelerate from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in 6.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 112 mph.
The Volkswagen ID.7 Pro S trim will come standard with ""an array of standard high-end features"", the company says. It includes 19-inch wheels, front and rear illuminated logos, and power-folding mirrors outside. Volkswagen mentions a five-door KESSY keyless access with proximity unlocking and a power tailgate.
The paint color palette includes Mythos Black, Glacier White, Moonstone Grey, Aquamarine Blue, and Kings Red.
Inside, there is a 15-inch infotainment display and augmented reality head-up display, 12-way adjustable heated front seats with massage and memory (the steering wheel is heated too), and a panoramic glass roof with electrochromic dimming. Volkswagen mentions smart air vents and three-zone Climatronic automatic climate control.
Two interior colors are available:
In terms of safety, all ID.7 will get the Volkswagen’s IQ.DRIVE advanced driver assistance technology (hands-on semi-automated capability, including driver-initiated lane changes) as standard. Park Distance Control, Park Assist Plus with Memory Parking, and Area View features are also standard.
The higher trim level—Pro S Plus—adds some more features, like 20-inch wheels, DCC adaptive damping, and dynamic steering, as well as premium massage Climatronic seats, with a new automatic heating and ventilation function and an upgraded massage function.
There is a 700-watt Harman Kardon sound system boasting 14 speakers, including a front-center speaker and a trunk-mounted subwoofer.

Ford Explorer EV Goes On Sale In Europe With Up To 374 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/713990/ford-explorer-ev-europe-price/,"The MEB-based crossover is cheaper than a Mustang Mach-E. Oh, and it was also driven around the world.",3/27/2024 8:30,"The all-new, all-electric Ford Explorer can now be bought in Europe with prices starting from around €47,000. And yes, we know there’s also a completely different and much more expensive combustion-powered Ford Explorer for sale in Europe and the United States, but that’s just how Ford rolls, we guess.
Based on Volkswagen’s MEB architecture, the battery-powered crossover is roughly the same size as an ID.4 and about €5,000 cheaper than the Mustang Mach-E, although the Mach-E is 8.5 inches longer than the electric Explorer. Ford's European-bound electric crossover is also the first EV to drive around the world with Instagram travel guru Lexie Alford (@lexielimitless) at the wheel.
The battery-powered Ford Explorer goes on sale after traveling around the world
The all-electric Ford Explorer, which has nothing in common with the combustion-powered Explorer sold in the United States, is now for sale in Europe. Billed as a solid, dependable EV after driving around the world, the Explorer EV can be had with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and has a WLTP-rated range of up to 374 miles on a full charge.
That’s a pretty impressive feat for a car that should have been put on sale last year but a new European standard for electric vehicles postponed the market launch by about six months. The record-setting drive began and ended in the French coastal town of Nice, with the battery-powered Explorer passing through 27 countries and covering over 30,000 kilometers (18,641 miles).

European customers can choose between two powertrain options. There’s an extended-range rear-wheel drive Explorer that comes with a 77-kilowatt-hour (usable) battery pack and a single electric motor that makes 210 kilowatts (281 horsepower). This version has a maximum WLTP-rated range of 374 miles (601 km) and can draw up to 135 kW from a compatible DC fast charger.
The second powertrain option has a 79-kWh battery and a dual-motor drivetrain that’s capable of 250 kW (335 hp), while the maximum DC charging speed is 185 kW. The maximum WLTP range for the AWD version is 351 miles (566 km).
Both versions have an on-board AC charger that can accept up to 11 kW and Ford says that the Explorer EV will be available with a single-motor RWD trim that’s powered by a standard-range battery in the future, although the battery capacity wasn’t disclosed.
The Explorer EV starts at €49,500 in Germany, €51,765 in Spain, and €46,900 in France. It comes as standard with a heated steering wheel and front seats, massaging driver’s seat, wireless phone charging, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The two-row crossover can tow up to 2,654 pounds and has approximately 16.5 cubic feet of storage space inside.

Volkswagen R Wants to Be an Independent Brand and Launch Hot EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/713819/volkswagen-r-independent-brand/,R is getting a dedicated section at VW's theme park in Wolfsburg.,12/25/2024 9:04,"Volkswagen R started in 2002 with the Golf R32. Then the Passat R sedan/wagon came along in 2008, followed a year later by the Scirocco R, while the Polo R WRC landed in 2013. In recent years, ""R"" has even been used for hot versions of the Arteon and T-Roc, Tiguan, and Touareg SUVs. But in 2024, VW wants R to evolve into an independent brand.
The plan is to open a dedicated Volkswagen R section at the Autostadt theme park in Wolfsburg. If you haven't been there already, it’s a visitor attraction located near the company’s factory, similar in philosophy to the BMW Welt in Munich. Annually, about two million people visit the Autostadt and its multiple pavilions dedicated to VW Group brands, from Skoda and SEAT to Audi and Lamborghini. An R pavilion spanning 1,076 square feet will join them this summer.
Fans of hot VWs will have the opportunity to check out concept cars and limited-run production models. Inevitably, there will be electric performance models on display. VW says the R lineup will gradually evolve in the coming years with amped-up EVs in the works. The process has already started with the Touareg R—complete with a plug-in hybrid V-6 powertrain.
However, there's still life left in the ol' internal combustion engine. The Golf R facelift is coming out this summer but sadly without a manual gearbox. That won't be such a dealbreaker in Europe where the Mk8 was never offered with three pedals but the stick shift will be missed by enthusiasts in the US.
VW’s decision to distance R (originally called Volkswagen Individual GmbH) from the main brand started in 2020 when it became a separate business unit. Elsewhere within the VW Group, SEAT went a step further with its US-bound Cupra spin-off marque by introducing standalone models. Audi Sport is also a separate entity within Audi.
As to what the future entails, VW has said the ninth-gen Golf will be exclusively electric. Will that be the first electric R? Time will tell, but we're likely going to see an electric GTI first. Spicy EVs are already part of the company's portfolio since the GTX models have more power, including even the ID. Buzz GTX minivan.
In the meantime, R is doing better than ever as more than 35,000 cars were produced in 2023, a record for the brand. Since 2002, over 300,000 R-badged vehicles have been sold.

"Early Chevy Blazer EV Buyers Can Get Reimbursed Up To $6,520",https://insideevs.com/news/713354/chevrolet-blazer-ev-reimbursement/,Chevrolet dropped the price of its Blazer EV. Now it's offering early buyers some money to make up the difference.,3/21/2024 18:02,"General Motors is handing out checks to customers who bought its Chevrolet Blazer EV before a price cut earlier this month. That's according to Edmunds, which has the electric SUV in its long-term test fleet and got a letter in the mail from Chevrolet regarding the refunds.
Edmunds said it qualifies for $5,620 back, since the Blazer EV RS AWD it purchased got its base price chopped from $60,215 to $54,595. Customers who bought a Blazer LT AWD are eligible for up to $6,520 to make up for the discrepancy between old and new pricing.
The Chevrolet Blazer EV's rocky start
Chevy pulled the Blazer EV from the market late last year due to software issues that were first reported by InsideEVs. General Motors restarted sales earlier this month, cutting the Blazer's price by thousands across trims.
Customers who bought a 2024 Blazer EV before March 7 of this year qualify for reimbursements, the letter said. A GM spokesperson confirmed that the reimbursements reflect the difference in old versus new MSRPs. Chevrolet had said earlier this month that early customers would get reimbursed.
Shortly after launching the Blazer EV last year, GM pulled it from the market due to software issues that were first reported by InsideEVs. GM spent months working on a fix before ultimately restarting sales in early March with reduced pricing.
The reimbursement strikes us as an easy, relatively low-cost way for GM to make good with Blazer EV owners and show its early adopters that it won't leave them behind. Similarly, Ford issued refunds to Mustang Mach-E buyers after it cut prices last year. But not all automakers are so kind.
Tesla has issued numerous drastic price cuts over the last year or so without compensating customers. Lower prices are great for buyers. But they're not so great when the Tesla Model Y Long Range you bought for close to $70,000 is worth $20,000 less basically overnight.

Future BMW Electric Cars Will Have Bidirectional Charging,https://www.motor1.com/news/713239/bmw-bidirectional-charging-neue-klasse/,Neue Klasse models will power your household.,12/25/2024 9:04,"The Neue Klasse will be BMW's long-awaited dedicated electric car platform when it debuts next year with an SUV. Previewed today by the Vision Neue Klasse X concept, the architecture is bringing a handy feature that other automakers have had for years. Better late than never, the new wave of EVs with the famous white and blue roundel will support bidirectional charging.
That means the future iX3 SUV (2025) and i3 sedan (2026) will double as power banks to juice up your house, appliances, e-bikes, camping gear, and other products. While luxury automakers tend to charge (pun intended) you for just about everything, bidirectional charging is going to be standard on Neue Klasse-based models. Functions such as Vehicle to Home, Vehicle to Grid, and Vehicle to Load will all be supported without having to pay more.
While the current EVs and PHEVs use batteries with prismatic cells, the next wave of batteries will switch to round cells. BMW estimates that charging speed and range will increase by 30 percent, while energy density is going up by 20 percent. These sixth-generation batteries will power your toaster and whatnot.
BMW intends to roll out bidirectional charging in three stages, kicking off with Vehicle to Home for your household. Vehicle to Grid will follow, allowing the car's owner to feed the stored energy back into the network but only in countries where legislation allows it. Vehicle to Load will power external electrical equipment. Interestingly, the German luxury marque doesn't say anything about Vehicle to Vehicle to provide energy to another Neue Klasse EV.
After the launch of the iX3 and i3, BMW intends to launch at least four more models on the same underpinnings by 2028. By the end of the decade, the Munich-based marque projects more than half of its global annual sales will be represented by EVs. In the early 2030s, Mini and Rolls-Royce will go completely electric.

Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX Is A Hot Electric Van With 335 HP And AWD,https://insideevs.com/news/713137/vw-id-buzz-gtx-debut-specs-details-photos/,"VW’s go-fast people mover comes with a dual-motor setup, two wheelbase options, and two battery sizes.",3/21/2024 5:00,"The Volkswagen ID. Buzz is getting the GTX treatment.
Hot on the heels of the recently announced ID.3 GTX and ID.7 GTX, this souped-up battery-powered people carrier comes with all-wheel drive for the first time, courtesy of a dual-motor system, charging speeds of up to 200 kilowatts, and a maximum towing capacity of almost 4,000 pounds.
The new ID. Buzz GTX will be available in Europe with two wheelbase options, just like the regular versions, but unlike the bog standard modern Bulli, the GTX comes with two new batteries that are larger than those available on the non-GTX models.
VW launches its third GTX model in less than a month
The new Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX is the latest performance-oriented EV shown to the world by the German automaker after the ID.3 GTX and ID.7 GTX.
The new, hotter electric minivan is the most powerful ID. Buzz to date thanks to its dual-motor setup that makes 335 horsepower.
The standard-wheelbase ID. Buzz GTX packs a 79-kilowatt-hour (net) battery, while the long-wheelbase is powered by an 86-kWh battery. The smaller unit can accept up to 185 kW from a compatible DC charger and the larger pack can be recharged at up to 200 kW. By comparison, the non-GTX ID. Buzz can be fitted with either a 77-kWh pack or an 85-kWh unit and the maximum charging speed is 200 kW.
More Electric Minivans
Volkswagen doesn’t say how much range these new batteries can enable in the hot Buzz, but it did mention that no matter the pack, it can accelerate from zero to 62 miles per hour (0-100 kilometers per hour) in an estimated 6.5 seconds, while the top speed is limited at 99 mph (160 kph)
Power-wise, the new ID. Buzz GTX gets the same dual-motor setup as the recently unveiled ID.7 GTX. This means an APP550 permanent magnet synchronous motor that makes 210 kW (281 hp) at the rear and an AKA150 asynchronous motor that puts out 80 kW (107 hp) on the front axle. The total power output is rated at 250 kW (335 hp), making the hot minivan the most powerful ID. Buzz to date, with 40 kW (53 hp) more than the rear-wheel drive trims.
It’s also worth noting that the front electric motor is disengaged most of the time; it only kicks in when the traction control system detects wheel slip at the rear, which happens “within fractions of a second,” according to the German carmaker.
The towing capacity has been improved compared to the lesser models by up to 800 kilograms (1,763 pounds). The short Buzz GTX can tow up to 3,527 lbs, while the extended EV can pull up to 3,968 lbs.
Just like the regular ID. Buzz, the GTX can be had in either five- or six-seat configurations when getting the standard-wheelbase version, while the long-wheelbase model adds the option of a seven-seat layout. The cargo volumes also remain the same, with the five-seat SWB ID. Buzz GTX capable of carrying 1,121 liters (39.5 cubic feet) of stuff in the back with the rear seats in place, while the seven-seat LWB model can accommodate up to 306 l (10.8 cu ft) of cargo behind the third row.
Design-wise, the hot zero-emissions minivan comes with all the usual bells and whistles that we’ve come to expect from a GTX-branded EV. These include a redesigned front end with a new front bumper, black honeycomb grille, triangular-shaped LED daytime running lights, a bunch of plastic bits painted in high-gloss black, several GTX logos, and a new set of 19-inch alloy wheels.
The body of the ID. Buzz GTX is painted as standard in Cherry red, but Volkswagen will also offer si more solid color options, as well as five dual-tone paint finishes.
Inside, the EV features a black headliner–the only ID. Buzz to do so–GTX-specific seat designs, red cross-stitching on the steering wheel, and a few GTX badges here and there. It also comes with VW’s latest hardware and software for the infotainment system, which means the ID. Buzz GTX has a 12.9-inch touchscreen on the center console that’s a little bit easier to use than the previous iteration found on older ID models.
Furthermore, the ""IDA"" virtual voice assistant integrates with the internet-famous artificial intelligence bot known as ChatGPT to answer questions more naturally by using basically the whole internet as its source of information.
The souped-up electric people mover can be optionally specced with the biggest panoramic sunroof ever fitted on a Volkswagen. It integrates a liquid crystal film that can make the glass transparent or opaque at the flick of a switch.
On the safety side of things, the ID. Buzz GTX is fitted with an exit warning system that can warn and even briefly prevent a door from opening if it detects that a vehicle or bicycle approaches from behind. Travel Assist, which includes Lane Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Emergency Assist is available on the GTX, and VW says it’s now more responsive and smoother than ever.
Volkswagen will start taking orders for the new ID. Buzz GTX in the European Union this summer, with deliveries slated for the second half of the year. In the United States, the hot Buzz feels unlikely to make an appearance, seeing how the performance sub-brand has so far been a European-only affair.
That said, the U.S. will get the LWB rear-wheel drive ID. Buzz toward the end of the year, and maybe–just maybe–an all-wheel drive version will make its way stateside sooner rather than later.",Iulian Dnistran

It sits on the STLA Medium platform and has the following dimensions: 188.5 inches long, 74.4 inches wide, and 66.5 inches tall, with a generous wheelbase of 114.1 inches. One major advantage it has over the Tesla Model Y sold in Europe is the availability of a third row.
You can imagine there's not much cargo space left with all seven seats in place, but 9.1 cubic feet should suffice for short trips around town. In the five-seat configuration, the luggage capacity jumps to 26.4 cubic feet. Should you need even more, you can fold the second row as well and unlock a cavernous 64.0 cubic feet.
While SUVs nowadays tend to have swoopy rooflines, the new Peugeot 5008 retains the boxy shape of its predecessor to maximize interior space. It largely inherits the design of its E-3008 smaller brother, complete with the same 21-inch display positioned atop the dashboard. There are also 10 customizable touch controls providing shortcuts to often-used functions accessible from the center console.
The most affordable version will be powered by a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with 48V technology. This tiny three-cylinder mill sends 136 horsepower to the front wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission featuring a built-in electric motor.
Should you need more oomph, the plug-in hybrid combines a 150-hp combustion engine with a 123-hp electric motor for a total system output of 195 hp channeled through a seven-speed, dual-clutch auto. This PHEV can cover more than 50 miles on electric power before the gas engine starts feeding from the 15.8-gallon fuel tank.
Then there’s the fully electric E-5008 model available in multiple configurations. The single-motor, front-wheel-drive versions come with 210 hp and 228 hp, both of which offer an instant torque of 254 pound-feet. Step up to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model, and the combined output is rated at 318 hp.
Stick to the front-wheel-drive model and Peugeot installs a 73.0-kilowatt-hour battery good for 311 miles. The bigger 98.0-kWh pack means fewer stops at a charging station since the range grows to 410 miles. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version gets the bigger battery but efficiency takes a hit due to the vehicle's higher curb weight.
Those batteries are guaranteed for eight years or 100,000 miles during which Peugeot is sure charging capacity won't drop below 70 percent. A heat pump comes as standard, as does the 11-kW charger. You can optionally get a 22-kilowatt charger, while DC charging can support up to 160 kW. In this case, it takes 10 minutes to put enough energy in the battery for 62 miles. Spending half an hour at a charging station replenishes the battery from 20 to 80 percent.
In recent years, Stellantis has ruled out a return for Peugeot to North America but that STLA Medium platform is likely to underpin a series of US-bound electric models.

2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC Plug-In Hybrid Lands In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/713188/2025-mercedes-glc-phev/,The most popular Mercedes-Benz car in the U.S. gets an electrified addition as PHEVs gain traction.,3/20/2024 16:00,"Mercedes-Benz is expanding its SUV line-up here in the U.S. The GLC, the best-selling car in the U.S. with a three-pointed badge will now get a plug-in hybrid edition. Say hello to the 2025 GLC 350e.
The most interesting aspect of this new variant is its drivetrain. In addition to its 2-liter four-cylinder gas engine, the GLC 350e gets a 24.8 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery that powers a 135-horsepower electric motor, resulting in a combined system output of 313 hp. The e-motor also produces an impressive 325 pound-foot of torque (406 lb-ft combined).
PHEVs gain traction in the U.S.
Just like battery electric cars, plug-in hybrids also had a record sales year in the U.S. in 2023. As the U.S. moves away from gas cars, PHEVs make sense for those concerned about range and charging infrastructure, while still reaping some of the advantages of driving an EV.
The plug-in hybrid system allows an electric-only range of 81 miles on the WLTP cycle—we know that’s an overly optimistic figure. The EPA range would likely be in the 50-60 miles range. But credit where it's due, that’s still enough to satisfy your average daily driving needs, and it seems to be more than what the competition offers.
You can drive the GLC 350e at speeds up to 87 miles per hour on battery power only. In terms of charging, you can plug it in at home with an 11-kilowatt AC charger. But it also supports up to 60 kW of fast charging, which will fully charge the battery in 30 minutes. There's up to 100 kW of recuperation capacity from the energy recovery system.
Whether you’re buying a Mercedes, plug-in hybrid, or not, you’re of course expecting to indulge in some of the luxury goodies. The GLC 350e won’t deprive you of those.
Standard features-wise, everything on the GLC 300 will carry over to the GLC 350e. There will be three trim levels on offer: Standard, Exclusive, and Pinnacle. You can choose from 13 upholstery options, while key interior features include heated and 16-way power-adjustable front seats, ambient lighting, adaptive headlamps, wireless Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay among several other items. The top trim also gets digital light projections and insulated glass.
PHEVs serve as a halfway house between gas cars and pure electric models, allowing customers to feel how electric drive works, and hopefully learn some of the charging and battery preservation techniques. But don’t forget to plug it in—because if not, you’re just burning more fuel by lugging a heavy battery around.
The GLC 350e will join a growing crop of plug-in vehicles as manufacturers and consumers embrace the technology increasingly. It will join the likes of the Audi Q5 55 TFSI e, BMW X5 xDrive45e, and Ford Escape PHEV among several others. Pricing will be announced closer to launch in the second half of 2024.

"The New Audi A5, Q5, And A6 E-Tron Confirmed For 2024 Reveal",https://www.motor1.com/news/713087/audi-a5-q5-a6-e-tron-coming-2024/,More than 20 new models are due by late 2025.,12/25/2024 9:04,"It's only March, but Audi has already introduced several new products. It started with the updated Q7 in late January before the RS6 Avant GT arrived in early February. The revised S3 debuted a few days later, followed by the normal A3 facelift last week. The first-ever Q6 E-Tron joined the fray a few days ago. But there's much more to come later this year.
The 154-page Audi Report 2023 document mentions more than 20 new products will hit the market before the end of next year. Leading the way will be the A6 E-Tron (pictured above in prototype guise). It's arriving in the following months as a fully electric model based on the Premium Platform Electric. The PPE hardware has been co-developed with Porsche and has already underpinned the Q6 E-Tron and Macan. The new A6 E-Tron will be sold as a sedan (well, it'll technically be a five-door hatchback) and as a wagon.
In the year's second half, Audi will take the wraps off the next-generation A5 lineup and the Q5. These models will ride on what the Four Rings refers to as the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), which will be an evolution of the VW Group's existing MLB architecture. The German luxury brand doesn't mention the A4 at all, and that's because it's going away.
The A4 we know today will become the A5, leaving room in the lineup for a future electric-only A4 E-Tron. Audi doesn't say whether there will be another sedan in this segment with combustion engines or whether the A5 Sportback will supersede the A4 Sedan. Spy shots have revealed the wagon will live to see another generation, so prepare for A5/S5/RS5 Avant models to be offered alongside the Sportback.
Car paparazzi haven't seen any prototypes of an A5 coupe or a convertible but here's hoping the two-door models are still planned. That said, the segment is shrinking, which is why Mercedes has fused the C-Class and E-Class coupe and convertible models to create the CLE.
The Q5 will enter its third generation in 2024, and just like the upcoming A5, it's getting a new family of ""highly efficient"" combustion engines with plug-in hybrid power. These will be the last ICE developments from Audi since the brand intends to launch its final cars with conventional powertrains in 2026. Every new launch after will be an EV because the company wants to go purely electric by the end of 2033.
Meanwhile, here are some of the other models we think are coming out by late 2025. There should be a Q3 compact crossover successor, a facelifted RS3 hot hatch/sedan duo, a Q6 E-Tron Sportback with a rakish roofline, an electric A8 sedan replacement, and a Q9 three-row SUV.
The A1 and Q2 won't be renewed as Audi has announced that these models will be retired at the end of their life cycle. The TT suffered the same fate last year when it was discontinued, with the R8 facing an imminent death as well.

Bentley Delays First EV Due To Software Problems,https://www.motor1.com/news/712921/bentley-first-electric-vehicle-delayed/,It's also pushing back the goal to become electric-only from 2030 to 2033.,12/25/2024 9:04,"Bentley intended to introduce its first electric model in 2025—but that's not happening. CEO Adrian Hallmark told Automotive News Europe the EV has been delayed by a year because of technical problems caused by software issues as well as ""platform-related concerns."" Crewe's inaugural EV is now expected to break cover near the end of 2026, but customer deliveries won't start until 2027.
Separately, Autocar has learned Bentley is also pushing back its goal to become entirely electric by the end of the decade. According to the new agenda, the ultra-luxury British brand wants to completely get rid of gasoline cars by 2033. The three-year delay will allow the company to invest more in plug-in hybrids to provide a smoother transition to an EV-only lineup early into the next decade.
The inaugural EV is going to be manufactured at home in the UK and will be underpinned by the Premium Platform Electric co-developed by Porsche and Audi. The first PPE-based models have been recently revealed as the second-generation Macan in January and the Q6 E-Tron earlier this week. While all three brands sit underneath the Volkswagen Group umbrella, Audi technically owns Bentley (as well as Lamborghini and Ducati) since 2022.
The decision to delay the EV isn't surprising. The Macan and Q6 E-Tron were also supposed to arrive sooner, per the original announcements. Before the first zero-emission model arrives, Bentley is preparing to launch a high-performance plug-in hybrid setup based around a V-8. It'll indirectly replace the venerable W-12, which is sadly going away with the 740-horsepower Batur.
The company's head honcho admits Bentley had estimated demand for hybrids would decrease closer to the end of the decade, but it's now expected to rise. Consequently, the high-end automaker is pouring ""hundreds of millions"" into a new wave of PHEVs that'll remain on sale early into the next decade to meet demand.
We'll be seeing that punchy V8 PHEV setup in the GT, GTC, and Flying Spur later in 2024. The current V-6 PHEV is staying while the Bentayga will retain its pure gasoline powertrain until 2026 when the posh SUV is set to become electric-only.
The now-delayed EV won't replace an existing model as it'll be a completely different product. When it does arrive, it's getting a hotter Speed version touted as ""the W12 of batteries"" with electric motors developed to deliver 50 to 100 percent more power than ICEs. For now, the most potent model on this PPE platform is the Porsche Macan Turbo with 630 hp and 833 pound-feet of torque.
The batteries that will go inside Bentley's first EV will have enough juice for 350 to 450 miles on a single charge, according to a statement made last year by Hallmark. It'll take less than 20 minutes to replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent.
For the time being, the Bentayga is the undisputed sales king with a 44-percent share of the total volume in 2023. The Continental GT/GTC is next with 31 percent while the Flying Spur occupies the last spot on the podium with a 25-percent share. In 2023, total deliveries dropped by 11 percent to 13,560 units.

"The 2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron In-Car Tech: PlugShare, Video Games, OTA Updates And More",https://insideevs.com/news/712859/audi-q6-etron-tech-impressions/,"After several delays, the Volkswagen Group says its software revolution is ready for prime time. We try it out on the new Audi Q6 E-Tron.",3/18/2024 14:00,"Audi invited me to take the new 2025 Q6 and SQ6 E-Tron for a couple of spins at its test track near Munich. You honestly can’t learn all that much from such a brief drive in a controlled environment, but my first impressions are positive.
The SUV’s interior feels just as sturdy and high-quality as you’d expect from an Audi. Both models handled confidently enough through corners, particularly in “Dynamic” mode, which stiffened up the suspension. The Q6’s regenerative braking blended smoothly into regular, mechanical braking. A handy graphic on the SUV’s central screen indicated when that transition was happening and which axle was responsible for regenerative braking at any given moment, which was neat.
I got a lot more time to poke around a stationary Q6’s infotainment system, which is a standout feature.
(Full Disclosure: To make sure InsideEVs got a preview of the Q6 E-tron, Audi flew me out to Germany, put me up in a hotel and fed me schnitzel in large quantities.)
The VW Group has had many software delays
Software is a consistent challenge for automakers who envision a future powered by wireless updates, new downloadable features, bug fixes and, of course, revenue. The software in the new Audi Q6 E-Tron suffered from numerous delays, but the Volkswagen Group says it's ready for deployment now. It's key to the conglomerate's future EV programs, so it had better work right.
The Q6 gets a sprawling 14.5-inch central touchscreen and an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster, which are both housed behind the same curved piece of glass that’s canted toward the driver. The idea was to envelop the driver without overwhelming him or her, Audi says. And I think it pulled that off. The Q6 E-Tron is also Audi’s first vehicle to offer a third display for the front passenger.
What’s perhaps more important is the software powering those many screens. The Q6’s new, Android Automotive-based infotainment system—a first for Audi—was remarkably satisfying to use and responsive to taps, swipes and scrolls. All in all, playing around with the Q6’s dual touchscreens felt more like using a silky-smooth tech product than a typical automotive infotainment system.
Audi chose Android because it’s a familiar platform to app developers, spokesperson Stefan Grillneder said. At launch, the Audi app store will have 40 apps to choose from—like Zoom, YouTube, a web browser and a racing game called Beach Buggy Racer—but the company expects to offer a wider selection over time. It envisions that games and other entertainment apps could help owners pass the time while charging.
The Q6 I poked around was loaded with PlugShare, the famously helpful charging station locator. Video games might get old after a while, but that sort of integration strikes me as a total no-brainer.
Audi is also introducing a more advanced voice assistant that I found impressively responsive. While the Audi Assistant doesn't integrate ChatGPT like Volkswagen's latest voice control offering, it does use AI to understand more prompts than previous systems. The feature can respond to more than 800 commands, Audi says, and suggest things based on a driver's past actions. For example, it might recommend the butt warmer if it notices that a driver tends to switch it on in certain weather.
I asked the Audi Assistant to switch drive modes, route me to the nearest fast-charging station and open all the windows a crack, and it obliged without hesitation.
As such, the Q6 E-Tron represents a leap forward in the Volkswagen Group’s digital transformation. The company, like most automakers, envisions cars that are deeply computerized, filled with powerful software and endlessly updatable. The Q6 E-Tron debuts E3 1.2, VW’s latest electronics and software architecture developed by Cariad, its software division. (That will also come on the Porsche Macan, a close relative of the Q6.)
“What you have to keep in mind is that this is the most ambitious and the most performant electronics architecture that the VW Group has ever developed,” a Cariad spokesperson told InsideEVs.
In the new Audi, five computers control all major vehicle functions—from the infotainment screens to driver assistance systems to battery management. Traditionally, each individual component or sensor in a car—from the seat controls to the radar system—had its own discrete computer module and software. Those dozens of control units couldn’t communicate with each other or receive software updates. That’s what automakers like VW are moving away from, following Tesla’s lead toward vehicles that function more like tech products.
E3 1.2 introduces a vastly more capable and centralized computing system than VW previously had, Cariad representatives said. Previous architectures allowed for limited software updates to things like the navigation system or other application data, they said. Thanks to E3 1.2, Audi can dig deep into a vehicle to improve things, fix bugs or offer new paid features.
Importantly, the Q6 E-Tron is Audi’s first vehicle that will receive over-the-air software updates. (Before, Audi offered “functions on demand,” features owners could pay for, but not a stream of regular software updates, which Tesla pioneered.)
Updatability is a big benefit of E3 1.2. The new setup should also help the Q6 function better, Audi says. For one, more processing power allowed Audi to enhance the size and resolution of its infotainment screens. A Cariad spokesperson said that having all the driving dynamics handled by a single computer—a VW first—should boost performance.
Cariad has suffered delays and executive shakeups in getting its software into production, so all eyes will be on E3 1.2 as the Q6 rolls out to customers. We’re looking forward to getting our hands on a Q6 E-Tron as soon as we can and rendering a more complete review.

2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron: Audi’s High-Tech Flagship Has Arrived,https://insideevs.com/news/712853/2025-audi-q6-etron-debut/,Audi's new 300-mile electric SUV showcases a bunch of brand-new technology and aims straight at the extremely popular Tesla Model Y.,3/18/2024 14:00,"Audi isn’t letting an itty-bitty slowdown in the growth of EV sales derail its pivot to becoming an electric-only automaker. On Monday, the German luxury brand unveiled the latest and perhaps most crucial step yet in its electric efforts: the 2025 Q6 E-Tron.
Arriving in the extremely popular form factor of a midsize SUV, the Q6 E-Tron aims straight at the heart of American car-buying. It uses an all-new battery-and-motor platform that will undergird a host of future Audis and Porsches. It's a mechanical sibling to the new Porsche Macan, which is already making waves and isn't even out yet.
And it debuts the Volkswagen Group’s next-generation electrical and software architecture, showcasing the fruits of an effort that’s been notoriously fraught and slow-going.
Audi's technological spearhead
Audi, a subsidiary of the enormous Volkswagen Group, has been selling EVs since the 2019 launch of the E-Tron SUV (now called the Q8 E-Tron). The Q6 E-Tron uses all-new technology and aims at the extremely popular midsize SUV segment.
No pressure, right?
Audi isn’t shunning gasoline just yet. But the Q6 is a key part of Audi’s strategy to offer an EV in all “core” vehicle segments by 2027. And once its next generation of combustion-powered live out their days—around 2033—the brand will be all-electric.
If there’s one model that can bring buyers to electric Audis en masse and help usher in that future, it’s the Q6 E-Tron.
InsideEVs went to Germany last week to get the lowdown on the Q6 E-Tron from Audi’s engineers and drive the new SUV, albeit very briefly. So let’s dive in.
(Full Disclosure: To make sure InsideEVs got a preview of the Q6 E-tron, Audi flew me out to Germany, put me up in a hotel and fed me schnitzel in large quantities.)
The Q6 E-Tron arrives in the U.S. in late 2024 with two variants to start: the Q6 E-Tron Quattro and the sportier SQ6 E-Tron. It slots in between the compact Q4 E-Tron SUV and the Q8 E-Tron, a full-size family-hauler. The E-Tron GT, a sports sedan that’s a fraternal twin to the Porsche Taycan, rounds out Audi’s electric portfolio.
Unlike any of those models, the Q6 E-Tron rides on Audi’s new Performance Platform Electric (PPE) platform, which can be configured to fit a range of different sedans and SUVs from both Audi and Porsche. That new tech allows for excellent range, charging speeds and performance, Audi says. On paper at least, that seems to be the case.
Both the Q6 Quattro and SQ6 come equipped with dual motors in front and rear and all-wheel drive. The Quattro claims a peak of 456 horsepower and hits 60 mph in roughly five seconds, Audi says. The SQ6 churns out 510 horses and rips to 60 in 4.2 seconds. Unlike the upcoming PPE-equipped Porsche Macan Electric, the Q6 E-Tron has an asynchronous motor up front and a permanent magnet motor in the rear. That allows the Audi to disengage its front motor to slash energy consumption when needed.
A 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack nestled in the Q6 E-Tron’s floor will deliver more than 300 miles of EPA range in the Quattro, according to Audi’s internal estimates. That’s more than any Audi EV before it.
Pricing is still a question mark, but that range figure should make the Q6 E-Tron competitive, in at least one crucial metric, with the vehicles Audi has identified as its biggest rivals. Those rivals include the Mercedes-Benz EQB, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Nio EC6 and EL6 (from a Chinese startup) and, of course, the Tesla Model Y, the world’s best-selling EV.
It's worth noting that the new all-electric Macan, of which the Q6 E-Tron is a close relative, jumped nearly $20,000 in price over the old gas-powered Macan. Porsche is arguing it's worth it for the performance increase here, but it's unclear how Audi will round this out.
A rear-wheel-drive version coming down the pike (with the same 100 kWh battery but one motor instead of two) should offer quite a bit more mileage and will be the choice for Audi buyers who want absolute maximum range. A high-performance RS variant as well as a  Sportback version, Audi's name for a fastback, are in the works too. Timing on those is TBA.
The brand is touting some impressively quick charging speeds, too. Thanks to an 800-volt architecture (like Audi already uses in the E-Tron GT), the Q6 will be able to accept a veritable firehose of electrons: 270 kilowatts of charging power to be exact. There aren’t too many EVs on the market that can match that. Along with the new Porsche Taycan, it should be a charging-speed monster.
When plugged into a sufficiently powerful plug (rated at 270 kW or higher), the Q6 E-Tron can recharge from 10-80% state of charge in 21 minutes, Audi says. Assuming a total range of 300 miles, that maths out to a solid 210 miles of potential driving.
Interestingly, when using a charger that doesn’t operate at 800 volts, the Q6 E-Tron flips a switch that divides its pack into two 400-volt sections. Those then charge simultaneously at 135 kW, slashing charging times at less powerful stations. Under those circumstances, 10-80% should happen in 30 minutes, Audi says.
The question on everybody’s mind: Does it get a NACS plug?
Although Audi plans to move over to Tesla’s North American Charging Standard eventually, the Q6 E-Tron will come with the conventional Combined Charging System (CCS) port at launch. Audi isn’t ready to announce when its new cars will get NACS from the factory or how it will roll out adapters for Tesla’s charging stations, Audi spokesperson Mark Dahncke said, explaining that there’s still testing to be done to make Audis work with Tesla’s infrastructure.
(Some background, in case you need it: Most automakers have announced plans to shift from CSS, the old charging-plug standard, to NACS, which historically was only equipped on Tesla’s cars and at its Supercharger stations. Now, car companies have struck deals to use Tesla’s plug design and, therefore, much of its charging network.)
Audi hasn’t announced pricing for U.S.-bound models yet, but the base MSRPs of the Q4 E-Tron ($55,200) and Q8 E-Tron ($74,400) offer some clues. The Q6 E-Tron is expected to fall somewhere right in the middle, perhaps in the mid-$60,000 realm.
The Q6 is just one possibility derived from the PPE platform. In broad strokes, the idea was to develop a platform that could deliver high performance, lots of range, fast charging and excellent efficiency—all while being simple to produce at scale.
It bridges the gap between the Volkswagen Group’s MEB platform, which is for lower-end vehicles and doesn’t offer particularly high performance, and the J1 platform, which is used by the high-end E-Tron GT and Porsche Taycan.
Part of achieving all that involved developing more lightweight and efficient motors. The PPE platform supports three different motors for the front axle and two for the rear, all of which can be manufactured on the same production line.
Compared to Audi’s first-generation rear drive unit, the PPE’s rear motor is 62% more power-dense and 50% more energy-efficient, Audi says.
The PPE’s battery pack uses a new chemistry for Audi and large prismatic cells co-developed with the Chinese battery maker CATL. Bigger cells mean this Audi can pack more active material into a given area, boosting energy density. Individual cells are stacked into modules, allowing for different battery capacities. For example, the 83 kWh Q6, which will be sold outside the U.S., has essentially the same pack as the 100 kWh version, just with two modules poked out of its center.
Audi says the new, simpler layout allows it to assemble batteries faster and with more automation than before. To put things into perspective, the Q8 E-Tron’s battery pack comprises 36 modules and 432 cells. The Q6’s battery is made up of 12 modules with 180 total cells.
Audi also did a lot of work on thermal management, building improved systems that heat or cool the PPE battery to the optimal temperature for charging and driving. New to the Q6 is what Audi calls “continuous” thermal management. In extreme temperatures, the Q6 will automatically regulate its internal temperature to preserve battery longevity, even when it’s parked.
But the hardware specs are only part of the mission here. The new Audi Q6 E-Tron is a huge deal on the software and UX side too, which we'll cover in a separate story. In the meantime, do you think this Audi is shaping up to be as promising a contender in the EV crossover space as the Macan is? Let us know in the comments.

The Skoda Epiq Has A Pompous Name But It's Just Another Electric Crossover,https://www.motor1.com/news/712518/skoda-epiq-concept-debut/,"The production version is coming in 2025 and will cost the equivalent of $27,000.",12/25/2024 9:04,"Skoda intends to launch six EVs by 2026, and the most affordable of the bunch will be this pretentiously named Epiq. It’s scheduled to go on sale next year with a targeted starting price of €25,000, or roughly $27,000 at current exchange rates. Touted as being ""small but epic,"" the brand's entry-level EV will be among the first models to embrace the fresh ""Modern Solid"" design language.
At around 4.1 meters (161.4 inches) long, you can think of it as an electric alternative to the Kamiq. However, the subcompact Skoda Epiq is destined to ride on a dedicated EV platform, likely the MEB Entry the Volkswagen Group has already announced. The architecture has been previewed by the German automotive conglomerate with last year's ID.2all concept. While VW is going the hatchback route, Skoda is cooking up this crossover.
Even though it's shorter than the Kamiq we mentioned earlier, it's far more practical. The cargo capacity of 490 liters (17.3 cubic feet) is more than 20 percent higher thanks to the dedicated EV underpinnings, resulting in better packaging. The Czech marque remains tight-lipped about the other technical specifications, but it does say the unspecified battery pack is good for over 249 miles (400 kilometers) of range, presumably in the WLTP cycle.
The MEB Entry platform is intended for EVs with front-wheel drive whereas the regular MEB used by the bigger Enyaq comes with rear-wheel drive. The more expensive and powerful MEB-based models sold by the VW Group come with AWD by adding a front motor. It remains to be seen whether the MEB Entry models will get an all-paw setup at some point.
The Modern Solid design language per Skoda's marketing jargon will toughen up the appearance of future models. This Epiq has plastic body cladding around the wheel arches and unpainted sections of the rear bumpers. We also notice a pair of nifty roof rails, an illuminated rear badge, and slim lights at both ends.
The charging port is mounted on the front fender rather than at the back as is the case with the Enyaq. Contrasting orange accents are found inside and out, along with an interrupted light bar that goes across the wide grille. Overall, the Epiq looks to be more along the lines of a near-production prototype since it's unlikely to change all that much until 2025. Skoda calls it a design study rather than a concept.
Before the Epiq arrives in 2025, the bigger Elroq compact crossover will be officially unveiled later this year with an electric-only setup. These two will be joined by 2026 by the next-generation Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe. An Octavia-like wagon in EV flavor is also coming, along with a large three-row SUV previewed by the Vision 7S sans a combustion engine.

The Hyundai ST1 Is An Electric Work Van With Futuristic Styling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712338/hyundai-st1-work-van-reveal/,It looks like it traveled back from the future to do work.,12/25/2024 9:04,"And now for something completely different from Hyundai – a fully electric work van that looks like it has traveled back from the future. The ST1 sounds like the name of a trim level for a Ford Fiesta ST (RIP) or Focus ST sold in Europe. However, this alphanumeric designation denotes a purpose-built lineup of workhorses bundled as ""Service Type 1"" vehicles.
In typical Hyundai fashion, this initial reveal is only about the exterior design, with no details about technical specifications. We do know the ST1 is exclusively electric and has been developed to cater to small businesses in South Korea. It will be offered as a regular cargo van, a refrigerated van, and as a basic chassis cab for owners to retrofit the type of equipment they need.
Hyundai says it worked with local delivery companies to find out what they need from a work van. Riding on steelies and fitted with unpainted bumpers, the workhorse has a futuristic front-end design derived from the Staria minivan or the Kona small crossover. The main headlights are mounted unusually low while the full-width horizontal strip above is presumably for the daytime running lights.
The ST1 is tailored to those who need a more spacious van than what the Staria Load can offer and has chunky plastic cladding all around to protect the body. Much like on the Kona EV, the charging port is mounted at the front, to the right of what appears to be a small air intake. Hyundai likely had a good reason to put the front camera on the painted section of the bumper instead of moving it lower to blend it with the black plastic.
Hyundai says it developed the ST1 with the intent to make it easier to load and unload cargo by lowering the ride height. Although it looks like a box on wheels, the front upper spoiler was conceived with aerodynamic efficiency in mind. Even the bulky garnish connecting the cabin to the cargo area was designed to provide better airflow.
Full details and pricing will be disclosed in the first half of 2024 before the ST1 hits the domestic market later this year. Hyundai intends to sell the workhorse in other regions after the ST1 goes on sale in Korea.

"New Volkswagen ID.3 GTX And ID.7 GTX Tourer Come With More Power, Sporty Looks",https://insideevs.com/news/712084/vw-id3-gtx-id7-gtx-tourer-reveal-specs-details-photos/,"The ID.3 GTX gets VW’s most powerful electric motor, while the ID.7 GTX Tourer is the most powerful wagon ever made by VW.",3/13/2024 13:00,"Volkswagen is opening the performance EV floodgates with several sporty versions of its battery-powered models. So, without further ado, say hello to the new Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, ID.3 GTX Performance, and ID.7 GTX, the latter of which will be available in both Tourer (or wagon for American folks) and regular fastback sedan shapes.
A performance-oriented ID. Buzz GTX is also in the works, completing the GTX lineup of EVs that was started back in 2021 with the launch of the ID.4 GTX and ID.5 GTX.
Volkswagen goes all-in on the GTX lineup of EVs
Volkswagen revealed two new performance-oriented EVs today. The ID.3 GTX features the company's most powerful electric motor when specced in Performance guise, making up to 240 kW (321 hp), while the bigger ID.7 GTX Tourer becomes VW's most powerful wagon ever, with a total of 250 kW (335 hp) from a pair of electric motors.
We’ll start with the ID.7, since this one has the biggest chance of coming stateside, at least in fastback form, since the Tourer won’t be sold here. However, it’s exactly the Tourer version that gets the spotlight this time around because it is officially the most powerful wagon the German car manufacturer has ever made.
More Sporty EVs
Thanks to its dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup, the new Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer makes a total of 250 kilowatts (335 horsepower), 40 kW (53 hp) more than the most powerful non-GTX ID.7 available. The rear APP550 permanent magnet synchronous motor on the rear axle makes 210 kW (281 hp), while the front AKA150 asynchronous motor puts out 80 kW (107 hp).
An 86-kilowatt-hour battery pack is the only power source available for the ID.7 GTX Tourer, the same that’s offered for the ID.7 Tourer Pro S. It can be recharged at up to 200 kW from a compatible DC fast charger, meaning that a 10 to 80% top-up can take less than 30 minutes in ideal conditions.
VW didn’t say how quickly the ID.7 GTX Tourer accelerates, but it did mention that the performance-oriented family EV “delivers maximum power and torque in a fraction of a second when accelerating.” But that’s valid for all modern EVs on the market, so take that as you may. The maximum speed is electronically limited to 180 kilometers per hour (111 miles per hour).
Compared to the rear-wheel drive-only ID.7 Tourer, the GTX comes with a different bumper with a honeycomb grille and a different light design that’s specific for GTX models. The outer roof frame strips are also painted black, as are the side mirrors, side sills, and the lower area of the rear bumper.
Inside, the maximum storage capacity of 1,714 liters (60.5 cubic feet) of the regular ID.7 Tourer is carried over to the GTX. However, VW has fitted GTX-specific seats to the sporty electric family hauler that come with red decorative seams and perforated red lettering in the backrests.
The ID.7 GTX also comes as standard with a specially tuned chassis, sportier steering, LED matrix headlights, LED tail light clusters with dynamic turn signals, tinted glass in the rear, 20-inch alloy wheels, and 30-color instead of 10-color background lighting. The sporty family EV also gets an enhanced augmented reality head-up display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone automatic climate control, and the IDA voice assistant that integrates with ChatGPT.
The smallest of the ID family of EVs, the ID.3, also gets the GTX makeover almost five years after its debut in 2019. And to make up for lost time, VW fitted the most powerful version of its APP550 electric motor to date in the back of the compact electric hatchback.
In GTX Performance guise, the ID.3 makes a rather impressive 240 kW (321 hp) from just a single electric motor, whereas the previously mentioned ID.7 GTX Tourer has the same power output from two electric motors. At the same time, there’s an ID.3 GTX (non-Performance) that makes 210 kW (281 hp), the same as the single-motor ID.7. Torque is rated at 545 Newton-meters (401 pound-feet) for both output levels.
Volkswagen says the performance EV is more powerful than its most potent V6 turbocharged engines. The sporty ID.3 GTX needs 6 seconds to accelerate from zero to 62 mph (0-100 kph), while the more potent ID.3 GTX Performance cuts the time to 5.4 seconds. Top speed is limited to 180 kph (111 mph) and 200 kph (124 mph), respectively.
A bigger, 79-kWh (net) battery pack comes as standard for both versions of the ID.3 GTX. Besides being 2 kWh bigger than what’s available in the top-spec non-GTX ID.3, the new battery also increases the maximum DC charging speed from 170 kW to 175 kW. This means a 10 to 80% top-up can take about 26 minutes when connected to a compatible DC fast charger. The ID.3 GTX also features a battery pre-conditioning system that is enabled automatically when using the car’s built-in navigation system, or it can be enabled manually.
Volkswagen claims the expected combined WLTP driving range is roughly 600 km (372 miles). By comparison, the non-GTX ID.3 with the 77-kWh battery has a WLTP range of 5346 km (339 miles), while the entry-level model with the 58-kWh pack can travel for up to 426 km (264 miles), according to the WLTP testing.
Much like the bigger ID.7 GTX Tourer, the ID.3 GTX comes with a redesigned front bumper that integrates a pair of triangular LED daytime running lights, high-gloss black elements on the exterior, and 20-inch wheels. Inside, the compact EV features premium sport seats with red stitching as standard, as well as a new generation of the automaker’s infotainment system that includes ChatGPT integration and a 12.9-inch touchscreen.

"New Fiat 500e Versions Add Style, Luxury And Equipment",https://insideevs.com/news/711969/fiat-500e-drop-fall/,The Inspired By Beauty and Inspired by Music add more charm to the EV city car.,3/11/2024 17:00,"When Fiat announced its intention to bring the 500e to the U.S. and North America, it also introduced a novel method of selling its cars. Instead of a traditional inventory and order sheet, it would do “drops,” akin to a new designer bag, or a pair of red boots from MSCHF.
For each drop, a handful of units are made in a specific theme, color, or equipment package, and when they’re sold out—they’re sold out. Fiat has announced its latest drop, which follows up with its sold-out Project (Red) initial units. There are two new flavors of the Fiat 500e—Inspired by Beauty, and Inspired by Music, both of which add more style and equipment to the standard Fiat 500e.
Fiat's sales tactics could work
On paper, the Fiat 500e's price and range seem like a hard sell. But, Fiat's novel way of selling the model via ""drops"", could be the way forward for the brand. The initial drop, the Project (Red) edition, sold out fairly quickly after it was announced.
First up, is the inspired by Beauty. Painted in a trendy shade of Rose Gold, the Inspired By Beauty edition is the only way to get this paint color on a Fiat 500. Inside, Fiat has coated the dashboard and steering wheel in a fashionable eco-leather The seats are also wrapped in eco-leather, but colored beige.
The aptly named Inspired By Music variant is meant to appeal to Audiophiles. Developed with legendary Italian Maestro Andrea Bocelli, the Fiat 500e’s 7-speaker JBL audio system comes with a fleet of Virtual Venues that Fiat says “offers listeners a virtual-reality audio experience that changes the acoustic characteristics of the car depending on the chosen location.” There are four to choose from that Fiat describes as follows:
• My Music Room – An intimate musical experience as if the artist was playing your favorite song right in front of you
• My Recording Studio – Pure acoustics and beautiful tones of a real recording space created specifically for music and recording
• Giuseppe Verdi Opera House, Pisa – Feel the spectacular nature of music in a unique theatre setting.  It’s as if you were sitting front and center, enjoying a live performance
• Open-Air Arena – Hear the unmistakable acoustics and energetic feeling of an open-air arena
Underneath, both editions are the same as the standard Fiat 500e. This means the car has a 149-mile range from a 42 kWh battery. That might not sound like much, but it does seem fairly respectable for a car with a not-so-big battery. That battery feeds a 117-horsepower front motor, pulling the car to 60 MPH in 8.5 seconds. Also, the two new variants introduce Fiat’s new level 2 ADAS system. The details are thin, but Fiat says the 500e uses the lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control for Level 2 hands-on monitored assisted driving in some places.
The Inspired By Beauty and Inspired By Music editions are a little pricier than the standard 500e. These units are $37,595, including the destination fee, up from the $34,095 of the initial Project (Red) edition. The Inspired By Music, and Inspired By Beauty editions will go on sale this coming fall.

"The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT With 1,092 HP Is Porsche’s New Performance King",https://insideevs.com/news/711859/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-gt/,It’s also the fastest series production electric car around Laguna Seca and the Nürburgring.,3/11/2024 9:35,"Porsche has long prided itself on making lightweight, engaging, precise, and fast cars, prioritizing driving experience over raw performance figures. In the electric vehicle era, this ethos is evolving due to the superior efficiency of electric motors compared to combustion engines. That means Porsche's signature persona now inevitably intersects with four-digit performance figures.
And that's exactly what you're getting today, with the new top-of-the-line Porsche Taycan Turbo GT and the Turbo GT with the Weissach package. This is incontrovertibly Porsche’s new performance king, beating even the decorated 992 911 GT2 RS and the long-gone hybrid 918 Spyder.
The race to make the fastest electric sedan.
Electric motors can extract energy from a battery pack far more efficiently than combustion engines can from fuel. That unlocks absurd levels of horsepower and torque. In the Porsche stable, the Taycan Turbo GT is the new performance king, and it's now in the same league as the Lucid Air Sapphire and the Tesla Model S Plaid.
InsideEVs tested one of its sensible siblings in California last month, the 2025 Taycan 4S. We came away impressed with its range and charging performance, despite testing in inclement weather. In fact, the MY2025 Taycans are among the fastest-charging EVs in the U.S. right now.
In our charging test last month at a 350-kilowatt Electrify America DC fast charger, the Taycan 4S displayed a peak charging rate of 295 kW. It went from 8% to 80% in just 18 minutes. Its real-world range is now comfortably over 300 miles, although we await official EPA ratings. The absurd Taycan Turbo GT, on the other hand, is more about performance than anything else.
To set itself apart from the other variants, it features a front spoiler with aero blades. Giving it a beefy track-focused stance are 21-inch lightweight forged wheels and SportDesign side skirts with carbon fiber inlays. The wing mirrors and B-pillars are also finished in carbon fiber. For additional downforce around corners, there’s a new adaptive spoiler, with a Gurney flap that enables a total downforce of 485 pounds. (The non-Weissach package car gets a ducktail spoiler.)
Inside, it gets 18-way adjustable sports seats and various exclusive elements like unique Turbo GT embroidering and contrasting Volt Blue or GT Silver interior colors.
But more importantly, Porsche seemed determined to shred as many calories as possible from the Taycan. With the Weissach package, gone are the rear seats. (Four seats are available without the package.) Instead, you get a storage compartment behind the driver and front passenger seats with carbon fiber cladding. This, Porsche says, saves 157 pounds of weight compared to the Taycan Turbo which weighs just a shade above 5,000 pounds.
The Taycan Turbo GT features some big upgrades in the powertrain department. New 900-amp pulse inverters—key devices in electric motors that regulate the flow of current into the motor windings—with silicon carbide semiconductors significantly reduce “switching losses” and allow higher “switching frequencies.”
For context, the Taycan Turbo S uses 600-amp pulse inverters. But technical jargon aside, all this means bucketloads of performance.
Base power is up only slightly, from 764 hp in the Turbo S to 777 hp in the Turbo GT. With launch control, the Turbo S maxes out at 938 hp and 818 pound-foot of torque, whereas the newly unveiled Turbo GT takes that to the next level, with 1,019 hp and 988 lb-ft for two seconds, or 1,092 hp as per Porsche’s peak power measurement method.
There’s also an “attack mode,” which unlocks 160 hp at the press of a button for 10 seconds.
Zero to 60 miles per hour sprint takes just 2.2 seconds. With the Weissach package, it’s 2.1 seconds. The Turbo S does the job in 2.3 seconds. Although these acceleration figures seem right up there with the Lucid Air Sapphire and the Model S Track Package. However, the Lucid is more powerful on paper, with 1,234 hp, whereas the Model S Plaid makes about 1,020 hp.
But it's worth noting that the Taycan Turbo GT can squeeze nearly 1,100 horsepower just from two electric motors, one on each axle, whereas the competition is equipped with three.
Porsche isn't chasing the best performance numbers here. With the Weissach package, the Taycan Turbo GT’s maximum straight-line speed is 190 mph, whereas the Model S Track Package tops out at 200 mph, and the Air Sapphire maxes out at 205 mph. However, on a racetrack, the Turbo GT will likely obliterate any other four-door electric sedan with its aerodynamic wizardry.
In fact, it has already done that. A black, low-slung pre-production Taycan with a fixed rear wing, a performance body kit, and German number plates was seen hugging the corners of the Nurburgring at blistering speeds early this year. It was some 17.6 seconds quicker than the Tesla Model S Track Package around the legendary racetrack.
On February 23, 2024, a Turbo GT in the Volt Blue livery set a time of 1:27:87 around Laguna Seca, narrowly beating the 1:28:20 time set by a heavily modified Model S Plaid in 2021.
The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT is now available to order in the U.S. at a starting price of $230,000, excluding fees and destination charges. Deliveries begin in the summer of 2024. The Turbo S costs roughly $20,000 less. With options, the Turbo GT could easily surpass the Lucid Air Sapphire’s $249,000 MSRP. In this company, the $20,000 Track Package for the Model S seems like a bargain.
Porsche has said that the 911 will continue having a combustion engine for ""as long as possible."" So an electric Taycan at the top of Porsche's performance charts could now be the new normal.

Watch Porsche Reveal The Taycan Turbo GT: Livestream,https://www.motor1.com/news/711870/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-debut-livestream/,The livestream starts at 9 AM Eastern / 1 PM GMT.,12/25/2024 9:04,"Update: The livestream is over and the Taycan Turbo GT is here! Read all about it in our debut post packed with information and photos of this very potent EV.
The New Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: This Is It
The ""most dynamic Taycan of all time"" will go official later today as a more powerful version of Porsche's hot EV. Likely to gain the ""Turbo GT"" suffix, the high-performance electric sedan will have the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire in its crosshairs. It already has a feather in its cap by setting a Nürburgring lap record for purely electric models.
Porsche has been tight-lipped about the Taycan Turbo GT but the spy shots of virtually undisguised prototypes running around the 'Ring revealed a more aggressive body. The comprehensive aero package will include that look-at-me rear wing and more subtle tweaks for better airflow. The engineers from Zuffenhausen might have put the Taycan on a diet before sending it to the gym to build some muscle. It's a logical assumption since the Cayenne Turbo GT also got more power and lost weight.
We'll have to wait and see whether those rumors about a third motor will pan out, but even without it, combined output is likely to hit four digits, at least with a boost function. Look for neck-snapping acceleration since adding power while removing weight will likely enable a 0 to 60 mph run in the low two-second range. Odds are we're going to see the most powerful production Porsche ever, although a temporary title since the Mission X supercar has high chances of entering production.
Let's face it – the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT won't save our fragile planet with its electric drivetrain. The intent here is to show an EV can be more than just absurdly quick in a straight line. It can be fun to drive around a track despite what will certainly still be a lofty curb weight. Driving it at full tilt is going to drain the battery at a much higher rate but that's a sacrifice owners will be willing to make.
As to how much it’s going to cost, a 2025 Taycan Turbo S is already an eye-watering $210,995. Porsche is likely to charge at least an extra $20,000 for the new crown jewel of the lineup. With options, you'll likely end up spending a quarter of a million dollars.

The Chevy Blazer EV Is On Sale Again—With A Big Price Cut,https://insideevs.com/news/711746/chevy-blazer-ev-sales-resume/,GM halted new sales of the SUV late last year due to software issues.,3/8/2024 13:12,"General Motors is finally putting the Chevrolet Blazer EV debacle behind it. The automaker has resumed sales of the troubled SUV after pulling it off the market due to software issues in December.
Plus, GM on Friday announced new, cheaper pricing for the Blazer EV lineup that could help juice sales following the pause. The entry-level Blazer EV LT AWD got the biggest price cut, bringing its MSRP (including destination) to $50,195 from $56,715.
GM's Chevy Blazer snafu
General Motors paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV in December due to serious software problems. InsideEVs experienced this firsthand when a BlazerEV we were testing broke down at a charging station, leaving our reviewer stranded.
Add on the $7,500 federal tax credit, which GM said that the Blazer EV now qualifies for, and the base price for a Blazer EV comes down to $42,695. Rules around which vehicles could receive the tax credit changed at the beginning of 2024.
Pricing for currently available Blazer EV trims is as follows, including destination charges:
Before the stop-sale order, InsideEVs' very own Kevin Williams had a Blazer EV press vehicle break down during a road trip, leaving him stranded at a charging station. GM didn't specify what kinds of software improvements allowed it to restart sales. The company delivered fewer than 500 Blazer EVs before the pause.
The Blazer EV isn't just another GM product. It's more important than that. The electric SUV launched late last year as the automaker's first next-generation EV truly aimed at the mass market. Other GM EVs riding on the company's new Ultium battery platform were the niche GMC Hummer EV, the pricy Cadillac Lyriq and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, a pickup truck.
Only the Blazer EV, a midsized SUV, aimed straight at the heart of the American car-buying public and at America's best-selling electric model, the Tesla Model Y. GM had already been slow to accelerate Ultium-based vehicle sales due to issues ramping up battery production. And it has ambitious plans to make billions per year on a wide variety of software, much of which it is developing in-house.
So it was a blow when software problems pushed GM to stop sales. To be sure, GM isn't alone here. EV startups and traditional automakers alike have been struggling with vehicle software, which is becoming more important as manufacturers eye snazzy tech features and subscription services.
A lot continues to ride on the success of the Ultium vehicles and the software that runs on them. So, for GM's sake, hopefully it's ironed out the serious kinks.

The New Rivian R2 Gets A Kitchen And A Rooftop Tent,https://www.motor1.com/news/711633/rivian-r2-accessories-features/,Other nifty features include a dual glovebox and a flashlight.,12/25/2024 9:04,"Rivian delivered an unexpected one-two punch yesterday at the unveiling of the R2 where it took everyone by surprise with the even smaller R3. However, the first order of business is to kick off deliveries of its long-awaited Tesla Model Y rival, but that won't happen until the first half of 2026. When it does eventually hit the streets, the R2 will be compatible with a series of nifty accessories.
Much like the bigger R1T pickup and R1S SUV, the latest entry in Rivian's growing lineup caters to outdoorsy people with a bunch of optional goodies. For example, the Travel Kitchen bundles a water tank, a cooler, an induction cooktop with additional storage and even a cookware set. Rivian will throw in some hanging lights for when you're cooking at night in the middle of nowhere.
Alternatively, the small kitchen can make way for a detachable cargo box with handles on the sides and tiny wheels to carry it around. It's good for items that would otherwise make a mess inside the car, kind of like a tiny portable pickup truck bed. The interior is also great at storing stuff since not only you can fold flat the rear bench but also both front seats. Oh, and there's a front trunk as well.
What else? The cargo box on the roof is nothing to write home about but Rivian can swap it for a so-called Treehouse. It's a boxy rooftop tent that comes bundles with a ladder for ease of access. Installed at the rear, the bike mount is hooked up to the R2 without having to use tools and it can store two bikes. While some cars have built-in umbrella holders in the driver's door, the electric SUV uses that space for a flashlight.
Although undoubtedly an interesting EV, the new Rivian R2 will sadly take its sweet time to hit the market. It’s especially true in Europe (including the UK) where it won't go on sale until 2027. In the United States, prices will start at around $45,000 but you'll be paying more for these accessories. Logic tells us the Euro version will be more expensive given the value-added tax (VAT).
There's An Even Smaller Rivian On The Way;",Adrian Padeanu
"Rivian R2 Won't Get Air Suspension, Will Be Dynamically 'Better' Than R1",https://insideevs.com/news/711606/rivian-r2-ditches-air-suspension/,Rivian might make some compromises but is advertising the R2 as a proper adventure EV.,3/7/2024 17:07,"Rivian is having a moment today. Following the reveal of its more affordable R2 electric SUV, and the retro-modern R3 and R3X compact crossovers, the start-up’s shares soared 13%. InsideEVs’ Deputy Editor Mack Hogan was at the event in California this afternoon, and we have some additional information about the R2 and R3 from one of the company’s top executives.
For starters, the R2 will not get air suspension, according to Jeff Hammoud, the chief design officer at Rivian. Both the R1S and R1T get independent air suspension, allowing 6.5 inches of vertical travel. The lowest setting can be as low as 7.9 inches, and the ride height can increase to a maximum of 14.4 inches.
Rivian's big moment
The California-based EV startup unveiled two new adventure-themed vehicles today, both more affordable than its current offerings. They won't go on sale until 2026 at the earliest, but when and if they do, they'll help Rivian reach the mass volume it needs to be a stable and long-term automaker.
Air suspension typically allows for improved handling, comfort, aerodynamics, and stability. It also enables self-leveling ride height, which balances for better handling when towing or carrying heavy loads.
Despite the omission, the R2 is expected to be “dynamically better” than the R1 models, Hammoud said.
Dynamically better could mean several things—the R2 might have better handling and agility, or simply be a better on-road vehicle. In traditional terms, ""dynamic"" cars can absorb bumps and road imperfections effectively and keep the vehicle stable and responsive to the driver’s inputs. The R2’s smaller size and presumably lighter weight should also make it more “dynamic.”
To be clear, we won’t know any of this for sure until the R2 comes out in 2026.
That said, the R2 and R3 seem built for outdoorsy owners. Both the EVs have separate ports above the trailer hitch for quickly mounting bike racks, storage boxes, and other items. The locking port sends power to the mounted accessory to run brake lights. You can store it in the frunk and take it on or off sans any tools.
The R2 also borrows some features from its bigger sibling. There’s a fold-out tray in the trunk to sit on. There will also be a camp kitchen available, but its design will be different from the original unit we saw on the R1T, according to Hammoud. He indicated that it will work with all Rivians, as well as other vehicles, so it will likely be a standalone external accessory and probably not something that sits flush behind the rear seats.
Are you thrilled by the upcoming Rivian models? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Rivian R3X: Say Hello To The Off-Road Focused R3,https://insideevs.com/news/711584/rivian-r3x-performance-offroad-focused-electric-crossover/,Rivian’s third big unveil of the day is the beefed-up R3X electric crossover designed to drive off the beaten path.,3/7/2024 13:47,"Rivian made a big splash in California today by revealing its next-generation R2 electric SUV. Just minutes after CEO RJ Scaringe showcased the R2, he surprised everyone with the R3 compact crossover, followed by another new model: its performance-focused, rally-styled sibling, the R3X.
""Looking at the R3, we wanted to take everything that's embodied and put it into a higher performance package, and this is something we call the R3X,"" Scaringe said at the unveiling event. Call it a modern take on the Russian Lada Niva 1600 from the 1980s, or the VW Golf Country, or heck, even the Crosstrek STI that Subaru never built.
At first glance, the R3X appears like a riotous R3 with a higher ground clearance and wider stance. It has multiple visual elements distinguishing it from the R3. The model showcased had orange mirrors, two tow hooks in the front bumper—which itself looks more muscular—and it also has blacked-out side skirts.
""It will deliver a level of on and off-road performance that will get us all very excited,"" Scaringe said.
Speaking of off-road, the R3X's tires and wheels are the most striking elements. It appeared equipped with all-terrain tires and full-wheel covers. Rivian even released a video on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, of the R3X going sideways in the desert, which says a lot about what Rivian wants the R3X to be—a proper high-octane off-roader.
Scaringe confirmed a tri-motor set-up—although it could be a while before Rivian releases its actual horsepower, range, and battery details.
The cabin follows a similar design theme. Rivian internally calls the cabin layout ""rugged playful."" It seems to have anodized metal panels and several sustainable materials. There's a tan and black seat upholstery with Rivian's signature oval inserts all around. Like its R1 and R2 siblings, the rear seats fold flat.
Cabin layout-wise, nothing surprising here. There's the same hyper-minimalist approach with few physical buttons and maximum digital real estate in the form of a massive central touchscreen and a digital gauge cluster. You also get coat hooks behind the front seat backrests as well as unique straps to hold items like towels.
If Rivian keeps up with its promise, the R3 and the R3X could end up becoming even bigger vehicles than the R2 in terms of sales volumes. The smaller and presumably more affordable R3 is what the market needs to encourage wider EV adoption, and ultimately contribute more towards emissions reduction.
However, it's one thing to stoke enthusiasm among your fan base, and another to deliver as promised. The company is still burning millions of dollars in cash and has a long way to go before witnessing any profitability. But we cannot rule out the possibility that these new and exciting models can help it get there.
Rivian said R3X deliveries will begin after the R2, which is expected to arrive in the first half of 2026. Although Scaringe implied that the R3 and R3X will be manufactured at its upcoming $5 billion factory in Georgia, it seems like the small crossovers could be initially made in Normal, Illinois, and production could later shift to Georgia.

Rivian R3: Meet Rivian's Surprise Compact Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/711576/rivian-r3-reveal-2024/,Rivian had something extra at the R2 reveal today. Here's what we know about its new compact entry-level vehicle.,3/7/2024 13:27,"It turns out the folks at Rivian had more in store for EV fans everywhere than just the Rivian R2 that debuted in California today. Meet the Rivian R3, an even smaller, more affordable compact crossover that's going to take the electric vehicle startup brand to new heights in the coming years.
""It takes the package of R2, and the platform, and shrinks it,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said during the car's unveiling today. ""It puts it into our take on a crossover. And as a vehicle, it's almost hard to define what it is, but it so beautifully captures our brand and what we represent as a company.""
Until now, Rivian's offerings—the R1S SUV and R1T truck—have operated in a larger, much more expensive space. The R2 is expected to bring a whole new audience to the brand with a far lower price and the long-term goal of volume sales, mass production and stability for a startup automaker that's doing better than others but has many of the usual challenges.
But what nobody expected was for Rivian today to go even more compact and cheaper. Almost Lada-like in form (and presumably off-road function), the small EV brings Rivian into a space it's never played in before.
Scaringe said the car is about five inches shorter than the R2, with a smaller wheelbase, ""but leveraging all of the same content—the single motor, the dual motor and the tri-motor.""
Rivian officials said both the R2 and R3 will feature two battery sizes, with the larger one targeting ""over 300 miles of range"" and the quickest cars being able to do zero to 60 mph in just three seconds. With pricing on the R2 expected to be around $45,000, the R3 is to slot in below that, although no details were offered.
Like the R2, the R3 will use Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug from the factory, making it natively compatible with Tesla's vast charging network. Both vehicles will be able to use Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs with an adapter. All are said to go from a 10% charge to 80% in less than 30 minutes. Additionally, the R3 ""will provide dramatically enhanced autonomous capabilities"" thanks to Rivian's five-radar, 11-camera automated driving assistance setup.
Scaringe added that the R3 won't skimp on the adventure vibes that made the bigger SUVs and trucks more famous. The second row of seats fold flat for camping adventures and the rear glass can be adjusted to carry large objects, like surfboards or instruments.
The CEO also then showed off a performance-focused variant called the Rivian R3X, which looks less built for camping and more ready for the rally stage. The R2, R3 and R3X will be available internationally following their North American launch, company officials said.  Scaringe also implied that the R3 and R3X will be built at the company's forthcoming Georgia factory.
The CEO said that the company has been ""working hard... to get them to as many people as possible as quickly as possible,"" and that Rivian hopes to begin R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026. ""We're able to do that we're able to achieve that that accelerated time by leveraging our production capabilities in Normal, using using our Illinois site to launch R2 and get that into market as quickly as we can.""
As for the R3 and R3X, those cars have no official release date yet. In the meantime, Rivian as a startup still has a tremendous amount to prove. But today, it succeeded in giving its fans something to hope for.

Rivian R2: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/711446/rivian-r2-suv-revealed/,"After months of teasers, Rivian's upcoming smaller SUV broke cover on Thursday.",3/7/2024 13:17,"After months of teasers and blurry spy shots, Rivian's next vehicle has finally been revealed. Meet the R2 crossover, the EV startup's long-awaited follow-up to its acclaimed R1T pickup truck and R1S three-row SUV.
The R2, Rivian announced on Thursday, will go into production in the first half of 2026. It's available to reserve with a $100 refundable deposit on Rivian's website and will start at $45,000.
This is Rivian's Tesla Model 3 moment
By establishing a brand-new U.S. car company and selling tens of thousands of high-end trucks and SUVs to paying customers, Rivian has accomplished the (nearly) impossible. Now it needs to turn a profit. The cheaper, higher-volume R2 SUV could propel Rivian to the promised land, much like the Model 3 sedan did for Tesla.
Much to everyone's surprise, at the R2 event in California Rivian also revealed the R3, an even smaller crossover built on the R2's platform. The whiplash didn't end there, as Rivian CEO and founder R.J. Scaringe went on to unveil the R3X, a higher-performance tri-motor variant of the R3.
It's tough to overstate how big a moment this is for Rivian. Getting a couple of high-end models into production and into customer hands is a massive feat in itself. Now comes the even harder part: Making enough money consistently to become a viable business. That's where the R2 and R3 come in.
As early leaks suggested, the production R2 looks a lot like a baby R1S. It has similarly boxy-yet-cute styling but in a more compact package. It's 185.6 inches long, compared to the R1S's 200.8 inches. That makes the R2 roughly the size of a Tesla Model Y, or slightly larger than a Toyota RAV4. The three-row R1S is closer in size to a Chevy Tahoe.
The R2 with a larger battery option will have at least 300 miles of range, Rivian said. It will come equipped with the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, charging port, which Tesla pioneered and most of the U.S. auto industry is switching to.
The R2 will come in single-, dual-, and tri-motor variants. The highest-performance SUV will have a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 3 seconds, Scaringe said. It will be built at Rivian's plant in Normal, Illinois to start. Importantly, the company says that will allow it to start pumping out R2s before its new factory in Georgia is up and running.
The upcoming SUV offers up some quirky features, like Rivian's signature flashlight that pops out from the driver's door. It also has two glove boxes and a retracting rear window. Both rows of seating fold down to make extra room for camping.
Details are more scant for the R3 and R3X. So far, we don't know how much they'll cost or when they'll arrive. Scaringe said they'll also have two glove boxes and a neat rear window that acts as a secondary hatch.
Smaller and cheaper than the Rivians that came before it, the R2 should let the upstart tap into a much wider customer base than it currently has. That's critical for a company that lost $5.4 billion in 2023. Moreover, Rivian said it doesn't plan to produce more vehicles in 2024 than it did last year, disappointing investors and indicating that demand for the R1T and R1S isn't growing.
Rivian's won acclaim for its rugged EVs and sold many more vehicles than fellow startups Lucid Motors and Fisker. It's diversified its business by making commercial electric vans—first for Amazon (a large Rivian investor) and now for all paying customers. But none of that will matter if it can't ride the R2 platform to long-term financial health.

However, Rivian will also livestream the debut and you can watch it right here.
Rivian R2 debuts today.
Rivian's affordable electric SUV debuts today and it could be the make-it-or-break-it vehicle for the electric startup.
The R2 will reportedly be priced from $47,000 and will get the full $7,500 tax credit, according to Rivian's CEO RJ Scaringe. This means that the effective price will be just below $40,000.
More On The Rivian R2
The Rivian R2 will reportedly offer seating for 5, an estimated range of 330 miles on a full charge, and come equipped with a NACS plug from the factory. The most capable version of the R2 should be able to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds.
As for its size, we previously reported the following:
Rivian’s smallest electric SUV to date is on par with the Model Y. Measuring 185.6 inches long, 75 in wide (excluding mirrors), and 9.8 in tall, the R2 is 1.4 in shorter, 0.6 in narrower, and 2.9 in taller than the Model Y. The wheelbase is 115.6 in.
The R2 will still be somewhat capable in the off-road category. Maximum ground clearance is 9.8 in with 32-inch wheels. The approach angle is 25 degrees and the departure angle is 27 degrees. These numbers are not nearly as impressive as the R1T or R1S though.
The Rivian R2 will be built at the company’s new factory in Georgia and will go on sale in 2026. The first sales will be in the U.S., with Canada to follow. Later on, the R2 will be offered in Europe too.
More details are expected to be released today and order books should open as soon as the R2 is revealed.
The livestream starts at 1 PM Eastern / 10 AM Pacific.

Dodge Says It Doesn't Care About The Charger Daytona's Efficiency Or Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/711242/dodge-charger-daytona-efficency-range/,"Dodge boss Tim Kuniskis says muscle-car owners don't care about efficiency. That said, the Charger Daytona is surprisingly efficient.",12/25/2024 9:04,"The Dodge Charger goes electric with the new Daytona model, but it is still unashamedly a muscle car. At a preview event for the Charger Daytona, Dodge head Tim Kuniskis told gathered media ""I don’t care. This is about performance,"" when asked about range and efficiency.
""Muscle car owners don’t care about fuel economy,"" he added. That said, the EPA range figures for the Charger Daytona are solid. The Charger Daytona R/T promises a 317-mile range from its 100.5-kWh gross (93.4-kWh net) battery pack, while the more powerful Scat Pack should do 260 miles on a full charge. Your milage may obviously vary – especially if you take advantage of the Daytona's donut mode – but that's an average figure of 3.4 miles/kWh for the R/T and 2.78 mi/kWh for the Scat Pack. Not bad for vehicles that weigh 5,838 pounds and offer 496 and 670 horsepower, respectively.
Charging rate is impressive too. The Charger Daytona uses a 400-volt electrical architecture, which usually translates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW, but it seems like it uses the trick of virtually splitting the battery pack into two virtual units charging in parallel, boosting speeds. The maximum rate of 183 kW is achievable at 350-kW stations.
So maybe Dodge didn't care about range or efficiency, but accidentally made an efficient car with a respectable range. All the more impressive given the power, size, and huge weight of the thing.
But we have to agree with Kuniskis here. We doubt muscle-car buyers will care.

2024 Dodge Charger Daytona Coupe And Sedan: Meet The First EV Muscle Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/711112/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-revealed/,Dodge's first electric cars go hard out of the gate with up to 670 horsepower and a thunderous simulated exhaust.,3/5/2024 11:00,"After months of concepts and teases, the Mopar world finally knows what the first electric muscle cars from Dodge will be. Meet the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona, which comes as a coupe and, much to our surprise, a sedan too. It’s a striking move for a brand whose product strategy in recent years has largely amounted to: “What if we put a bigger V8 in it?”
And yet, times are changing. U.S. consumers are asking for more electric options. Tesla is the most valuable carmaker on the planet and is stealing market share from old-guard manufacturers. Regulations aimed at curbing climate-warming emissions are pushing the internal combustion engine toward extinction. And more importantly for Dodge's target audience, the zero-to-60 mph times for electric cars are putting gas engines to shame.
A new, electric era for Dodge
Dodge first teased the concept for its first electric car back in 2022. Now it's broken cover looking pretty darn similar to that initial design.
Dodge can either cling to its V8s for dear life—or pivot. And it made the smarter move here. Being able to do 60 mph in as low as 3.3 seconds, making it slightly quicker than the old Hellcat Redeye cars, just sweetens the deal.
So, behold the 2024 Charger Daytona. The world’s first electric muscle car goes on sale in mid-2024, representing a big leap forward for Dodge and its European parent company, Stellantis, which is expanding its electric offerings globally but has been slow to do so in the U.S.
The Charger also reflects an important broadening of the limited U.S. EV market. More different types of vehicles that appeal to more buyers should help drive people toward EVs who didn’t have an option before. And while we knew the coupe was coming, the Charger sedan—which looks delightfully similar to the old gas-powered one—is a welcome addition to the small but growing electric four-door market.
The Charger Daytona arrives as a coupe that replaces the outgoing (gas-powered) Dodge Challenger. It also marks the start of a whole new Charger family.
Next year, Dodge plans to start production of four-door electric models to replace the current Charger, along with both two- and four-door gas-powered versions. They'll all share the same underlying platform, known as STLA Large.
It comes in two trims to start. The R/T debuts with 496 horsepower and 404 pound-feet of torque. The Scat Pack arrives with 670 horses, 627 pound-feet of torque and a claimed zero-to-60 time of just 3.3 seconds.
For now, Dodge has only shared details about the coupe, so that’s what we’re focusing on. (This is confusing, but only the Charger EVs are Daytonas.)
Dodge will be the first to tell you that the Charger Daytona isn’t trying to be the greenest car on the market. It doesn’t offer world-beating range or amazing efficiency. What it does provide is the beefcake performance Dodge is known for, along with solid marks across the board as far as EV stuff is concerned.
Both the R/T and Scat Pack are propelled by dual electric motors that grant it full-time all-wheel drive. They’re equipped with a rather large 100.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack that returns a respectable 317 miles of range in the R/T and a less ideal 260 in the Scat Pack.
Clearly, these cars weren’t designed for optimum efficiency; a Tesla Model 3 earns an EPA-estimated 341 miles of range with a battery pack that’s roughly 20% smaller.
That’s something Dodge owns openly. Its buyers have largely never worried about energy consumption, so why would they start to care now?
“When was the last time anyone calculated the fuel economy of their muscle car? Yeah, they never did,” Dodge brand CEO Tim Kuniskis said in a promotional video launched on Tuesday.
That may be true. But battery size will dictate how much the Charger Daytona ultimately costs. Dodge hasn’t quoted a price yet, but we know that batteries are the single most expensive part of an EV. We also know that Stellantis proudly says that, unlike rivals, it turns a profit on its electric vehicles. The entry price here will be very interesting, especially considering what a performance bargain the old cars were.
With a peak charge rate of 183 kilowatts, the Daytona can recharge from 20%-80% in just under 28 minutes, Dodge says, which is getting to be on the slower side these days. The big battery pack doesn’t help there either, but the charge rate is at least higher than some rivals.
Dodge went to great lengths to make its first EV as traditionally Dodge-y as possible. That starts with tire-shredding performance but includes a whole lot more.
The sleek Charger Daytona looks just like the awesome concept car that Dodge unveiled a few years back. It retains the muscular, retro-inspired features Dodge is known for and avoids the “melted jelly bean” look of so many EVs these days, Kuniskis told journalists during a briefing. Dodge accomplished that in a rather clever way.
At first glance, the front end looks totally squared off, but that’s actually an illusion. A slim opening up front allows air to pass more smoothly over the Daytona’s hood and windscreen, boosting its aerodynamic qualities. A flat nose that just bullies air out of the way wouldn’t be great for range.
Then there’s the (hilariously named) “Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust.” It isn’t just a speaker that plays engine noises for all to hear, but rather an actual exhaust-like contraption that rumbles much like a V8-powered Dodge would. It can also be switched off completely for when owners want to roll around in silence, as the EV gods intended.
A PowerShot button on the steering wheel activates 40 extra horsepower for a brief stint. Plus, there’s a Donut Mode that helps you do donuts. Clearly, Dodge wants buyers to know that just because a car has electric motors instead of an engine, that doesn't mean it can't be loud, fast and in your face.
European auto giant Stellantis has felt like a bit of a laggard in the EV space, at least in the U.S. Its first EV for American consumers is arriving imminently in the form of the tiny Fiat 500e. The Charger Daytona represents an important next step toward Stellantis becoming a real presence in the U.S. electric market. Stellantis is also planning EVs from its Jeep, Ram Chrysler brands.
Of course, we’ll have to wait and see how well the Charger and other Stellantis EVs perform—both on the road and in the marketplace. But anybody who counted Stellantis out may have spoken too soon.

The New Karma Gyesera EV Already Looks Familiar,https://www.motor1.com/news/710942/karma-gyesera-debut-specs/,Karma's first electric sedan promises 250 miles of range.,12/25/2024 9:04,"This year marks Karma Automotive's 10th anniversary. With that the company debuted the Gyesera—an evolution of the GSe-6, a fully electric sedan revealed in 2021. The GSe-6 had a design reminiscent of the plug-in hybrid Revero launched in 2016, which superseded the short-lived Fisker Karma introduced in 2011.
But the Gyesera hopes to be more than just a remix. Karma President Marques McCammon told Automotive News that almost all body panels are new compared to the Revero. Only a section of the rear quarter panels has been carried over. Even still, the styling looks familiar. The body is made from a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber on a spaceframe chassis made from aluminum.
Changes have been made to about 85 percent of the car, added McCammon. Karma Vice President, Global Design Michelle Christensen goes as far as to say it's ""the most badass GT on the road."" The new Gyesera is 199.9 inches long, 78.9 inches wide, and 52.4 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 124.4 inches. To put those numbers into perspective, it's 3.9 inches longer and 1.6 inches wider than a Tesla Model S but rides 4.5 inches lower to the ground.
The rear-wheel-drive Karma Gyesera aims to deliver 590 horsepower and 693 pound-feet of torque to enable a 0-60 mph run in less than 4.2 seconds and a top speed of over 135 mph. The specs sheet reveals a curb weight of 5,300 pounds. Mind you, these are preliminary figures based on simulations and early testing, so the numbers could change until production starts. There's a 120.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for over 250 miles, but the range is also a projection.
Karma Automotive intends to start production before the end of this year but doesn't rule out an early 2025 market launch. The electric sedan will be a limited-run affair since only approximately 2,000 units will be made during a production run of four or five years.
It's going to cost between $175,000 and $225,000, according to Automotive News. That's going to make it a lot more expensive than a Tesla Model S (from $74,990), a Porsche Taycan (from $99,400), a Mercedes EQS (from $104,400), or an Audi E-Tron GT (from $106,500).
Introduced this weekend at the Amelia Island Concours, the Gyesera can already be preordered for $5,000. The new sedan follows last year's introduction of the Kaveya electric coupe slated to go on sale in the final quarter of 2025 as the brand's flagship car. Meanwhile, an updated plug-in hybrid Revero is expected to hit the assembly line in Q3 2024.

"The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Gets A Bigger Battery, More Buttons, Rear Wiper",https://insideevs.com/news/710930/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-updates/,Everyone's favorite Giugiaro-cyberpunk electric SUV gets some upgrades we're very excited about.,3/3/2024 21:07,"At this point, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't at least respect the Hyundai Ioniq 5. With an eye-catching 1980s retrofuture design that looks like almost nothing else on the road and class-leading specs, this electric crossover is a favorite for many reasons. Now it's about to get even better for the 2025 model year with some upgraded specs we're rather excited about—including more buttons.
On Sunday, Hyundai unveiled the updated Ioniq 5 in South Korea, and while the car barely looks different on the outside—it has a slightly updated grille and front and rear bumpers—there are some serious improvements in play here. (You can also spot a new one from the rear spoiler that's been extended by 50 mm and the new wheels.)
And there's finally one big change here that's been requested by many: a rear windshield wiper. Take that, rain and snow.
The Ioniq 5 Has Been A Game-Changer
Hyundai's Ioniq 5 has racked up awards, hit sales records and made the world notice how advanced Korea's EV game is. As the electric competition heats up, it doesn't seem to be taking a breather.
I'll start by noting that this is the global debut of the updated Ioniq 5, and it's not clear yet what changes are coming to the U.S. market; the car Hyundai showed off continues to have digital side mirrors, and American buyers have never been able to get those, for example. But we do expect some, if not all, of these changes will come stateside eventually.
We'll start with the big news: the Ioniq 5 gets a bigger battery. Previously, buyers could choose from a standard 58.0-kWh battery pack or a larger 77.4-kWh pack. Now Hyundai is offering an 84.0-kWh pack, implying in a news release that this pack replaces the 77.4-kWh unit. Either way, that means the top Ioniq 5 will come with more range.
Not that the Ioniq 5 needed a ton of help in that department, of course. The current 2024 model in the U.S. gets 220 miles of range on the standard battery and 260 miles or 303 miles on the larger one, depending on whether you spring for all- or rear-wheel-drive, respectively. In other words, if this larger battery comes stateside, we could expect something like 330 miles in RWD form—but we'll wait for the official EPA estimates first.
More changes extend inside the cabin as well. There's a new steering wheel with ""interactive pixel lights,"" and a whole new row of buttons on the center console near the cupholders that didn't exist before. The ""Map"" and ""Navigation"" buttons have been combined into one, remedying a Hyundai-Kia quirk that has annoyed me for years, and the row of digital switches near the infotainment system appears to have received some tweaks as well.
There are some crucial tweaks on the software side as well. For one, the Ioniq 5 is now fully capable of over-the-air (OTA) software updates for all its major electronic systems, whereas it was much more limited in that department before. Now, like the Ioniq 6, it's OTA-capable for bug fixes, new features and more. Hyundai has also added various suspension tweaks to make the EV more stable and agile, not to mention quieter—and the doors and B-pillar parts have been reinforced for added safety.
Last but not least, Hyundai's added an Ioniq 5 N Line trim here, which won't give you quite the explain-yourself-to-the-traffic-court-judge thrills that the Ioniq 5 offers, but will add a dash of needed sporty vibes inside and out.
Customers in Korea can order the updated Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N Line this month, while the rest of us will have to wait for it to ""gradually"" roll out to ""global markets throughout the year.""
Will you wait for the new one, or seize the exceptional deals that can be had on the current EV right now? I'll wait for the EPA range on the new battery to make that call, but one thing's clear: one of the best in the business just got better.

This Secret Ford F-150 Lightning Will Climb Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/710790/ford-f-150-lightning-demonstrator-pikes-peak/,It could be a modified version of the F-150 Lightning Switchgear we saw earlier this year.,12/25/2024 9:04,"During Ford's big party in Charlotte to kick off the 2024 racing season, company CEO Jim Farley revealed a new ""EV demonstrator"" would tackle Pikes Peak. Details on that vehicle weren't mentioned, and for the most part, they still aren't mentioned. However, we at least know it will be an F-150 Lightning. But it won't anything you'll see at the local Ford dealership.
Ford shared a single teaser image on social media on Friday, showing the front of a vehicle hiding under covers. It's low, wide, and there's a wild wing at the back like the one on the bonkers electric SuperVan. In fact, if Ford didn't specifically say this was an F-150 Lightning, our minds would jump directly to some SuperVan iteration beyond the current 4.2 model. But this is a truck, and clearly, Ford is applying some of the lessons learned from its supremely fast van.
This hillclimb racer could be a variation of the Lightning Switchgear, a one-off prototype designed to explore performance envelopes both on- and off-road for the electric truck. We got up close with the Switchgear back in January, taking a ride in the off-road version with Vaughn Gittin Jr. at the wheel. It's called Switchgear because the same truck – with small changes to the suspension and tires – is designed to tackle paved corners the same way it tackles dirt jumps.
Ford didn't make two versions of the Switchgear, however. The same prototype accommodates both roles, which means we only saw the off-road version in person. During the event, a Ford rep told us it would be converted at a later date, which would be convenient timing for Pikes Peak.
The above rendering comes from Ford's Switchgear press kit, showing how the street version should look. Obviously there are quite a few differences between this and the teaser, notably that big wing and what could be strakes from the cab to the back, not unlike what we see on the SuperVan. If this new Lightning demonstrator is based on Switchgear, Ford is certainly taking it to the extreme.
Whether it's related to Switchgear or something completely different, we suspect this F-150 will be pretty darned quick going up the hill. This year's Pikes Peak Hillclimb is June 23, so expect more on this amped-up Lightning between now and then.

"The 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV Is A Hydrogen Plug-In Hybrid, For Real",https://insideevs.com/news/710194/honda-crv-hydrogen-plug-in/,"Meet a very different CR-V, and the first production plug-in hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle ever made. But can owners find fuel?",2/27/2024 9:00,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you melded the best qualities of a plug-in hybrid and a hydrogen-powered vehicle? (What's that? No? Okay, fair.) Well, Honda both asked that question and answered it with the 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV, a model it's calling ""America's first production plug-in hydrogen fuel cell vehicle."" It's a mouthful of a description for an intriguing new breed of zero-emission vehicle. And it's part of Honda's wider ambitions in the hydrogen space.
Allow me to explain what's going on here.
Hydrogen fuel-cell EVs
Hydrogen-powered EVs are a niche within a niche, and they only exist in California. They're quicker to fuel than regular electric cars, but a lack of reliable fueling infrastructure is holding them back.
The CR-V e:FCEV (the FCEV stands for fuel-cell electric vehicle) is an electric SUV that takes both electrons and hydrogen. Filling its 17.7-kilowatt-hour battery using an EV charger yields up to 29 miles of driving range, Honda says. Fueling the CR-V's tanks at a hydrogen station boosts its total mileage to an EPA-estimated 270.
The idea is one can plug it in at home and get enough inexpensive electric range to run daily errands, or they can fill it with hydrogen for longer journeys.
It's the same concept behind plug-in hybrids, which are something like a cross between an electric car and a conventional hybrid, like a Toyota Prius. Plug-in hybrids offer a few dozen miles of electric range married with the road-tripping convenience of a gasoline engine. Here Honda has swapped in a hydrogen fuel-cell system, which generates electricity using gas and produces water as a byproduct.
The e:FCEV will be available to lease in California later this year. There will be just one trim to choose from: Touring. In addition to the funky new powertrain, the new variant has exterior cues that make it stand out from other CR-Vs: a unique grill, liftgate and rear fascia, along with new body panels forward of the A-pillar.
Regardless of fuel source, the energy flows to a front-mounted motor producing a claimed 174 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. One standout feature: It also comes with the ability to share 1,500 watts of electric power with camping gear, power tools, appliances and more.
Cargo space may be disappointing for SUV buyers, though. The CR-V's hydrogen tanks protrude into the cargo area, effectively eliminating what looks to be a couple of large suitcases-worth of open space.
The CR-V e:FCEV uses Honda's second-generation hydrogen fuel-cell technology, which it co-developed with General Motors. Honda said the new tech is cheaper, more durable and higher performance than the system in the Clarity Fuel Cell, Honda's hydrogen vehicle that was discontinued in 2021.
Honda says it aims to make its car business carbon-neutral by 2040 through a combination of EVs and fuel-cell vehicles. But the automaker's hydrogen ambitions extend far beyond passenger vehicles.
Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said during a roundtable in January that EV technology is the ""optimum solution"" for making passenger cars carbon-neutral, whereas hydrogen will be more important for buses, trucks and stationary generators. Shinji Aoyama, the company’s global executive vice president, added that the upcoming CR-V is an important ""showcase"" of how Honda's fuel-cell tech is improving.
Honda is also working on hydrogen construction equipment and is researching hydrogen's potential as an electricity source in space, it said in a press release.
In short, fuel-cell passenger cars seem poised to remain only a small part of Honda's business over the coming years. But like several automakers, perhaps most notably Toyota, Hyundai and BMW, it's keeping that technology warm in case it takes off (including in non-U.S. markets) in the coming decades.
But the problem is less the car, and more of the fuel itself. Hydrogen stations are incredibly expensive to build—more so than even EV fast-chargers—so few fueling partners stepped up to help Honda and Toyota with their H2 dreams.
As a result, hydrogen-powered cars have been a niche for years. Save for some mishaps, they only exist in California, which is home to all of the country's 52 fueling stations. Their main draw is that their tanks take just a few minutes to fill up, just like a conventional car. Unlike a conventional car, though, they don't emit harmful tailpipe emissions. And you don't have to sit around for a half-hour waiting for your car to charge like you would with a standard EV.
Fuel-cell cars sound terrific on paper—until you try to fill one up. California's hydrogen stations are uncommon (increasingly so, apparently) and routinely out of order. The price of hydrogen has skyrocketed in recent years, although free fuel cards from automakers help offset that burden on drivers. Shell recently shut down all of its seven remaining hydrogen locations in California, citing ""hydrogen supply complications and other external market factors."" (And despite copious support from the Japanese government, hybrids aren't selling well there, either.)
The CR-V e:FCEV is, no doubt, an interesting piece of tech. And the fact that you can plug it in may make it more appealing than other hydrogen vehicles, which rely solely on public infrastructure. But the fueling experience will have to start improving to make it a truly attractive choice.

BYD Brings Denza Brand To Europe With Striking D9 Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/710022/denza-d9-minivan-europe-debut/,It's available as a plug-in hybrid and EV with a seven-seat layout.,12/25/2024 9:04,"The 2024 Geneva Motor Show kicks off today, and while most international brands are missing, there are a handful of European debuts. This D9 minivan marks the launch of Denza on the Old Continent. If the name doesn't ring a bell, it's a brand created by Chinese automaker BYD and Mercedes in 2010. Initially, the joint venture was 50:50, but the German luxury brand reduced its share to 10 percent in 2021 when Denza underwent restructuring.
BYD is paving the way for Denza in Europe by bringing the D9, a large people mover with a high-end interior to rival another posh minivan—the Lexus LM. It's not a completely new model since it initially went on sale in China in 2022. Much like in the People's Republic, the Euro variant can be had as a plug-in hybrid or as a full EV.
The three-row family hauler has a boxy shape, large electrically operated sliding doors, a generous greenhouse, and two equally polarizing grille designs. The imposing front end is just as striking as other new minivans, including the Volvo EM90 / Zeekr 009 and the Toyota Alphard / Vellfire twins. The boxy shape with a nearly flat roofline maximizes interior space and there's a large panoramic sunroof to make the cabin feel more airy.
Even though it's showcasing the D9 in Geneva, Denza remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications for now. However, look no further than the Chinese version to discover all the relevant numbers. It's 206.7 in (5,250 mm) long, 77.2 in (1,960 mm) wide, and 75.6 in (1,920 mm) tall, with a massive wheelbase of 122.4 in (3,110 mm).
Since Denza wants to lure you away from buying that luxury SUV, the D9 has an upscale interior with leather just about everywhere you look. The cabin has a 2+2+3 configuration with adjustable and folding seats, not to mention ventilation and massaging functions. Aside from the usual pair of screens in the front, there are extra displays mounted on the armrests of the second-row seats to control various functions.
In addition, there's a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens, along with a small fridge that can hold as many as six bottles. The captain's chairs in the middle slide fore and aft, offering copious amounts of legroom, while the grab handle on the B-pillars makes it easier to get in and out. Even rearmost seats get USB ports and a central armrest, along with LED ambient lighting, and speakers from the Dynaudio sound system.
While Denza keeps European specifications shrouded in mystery for now, the D9 sold in China can be had as a plug-in hybrid with a turbocharged 1.5-liter gasoline engine. The PHEV model is available with front- and all-wheel drive, along with a 20.39-kWh battery and a bigger 40.06-kWh pack.
The combustion engine is good for 137 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque (231 Newton-meters)) while the front-mounted motor is rated at 228 hp and 251 lb-ft (340 Nm). Go for the all-wheel-drive model and Denza throws in a rear-mounted motor that produces 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm). The FWD versions have a combined output of 296 hp and 421 lb-ft (571 Nm), good for a sprint to 62 mph in 9.5 seconds. Step up to AWD models and you're rewarded with a healthy 401 hp and 502 lb-ft (681 Nm) to cut the sprint time to 7.9 seconds.
In China, the Denza D9 electric model is also offered with a choice of FWD and AWD. Both have a front motor with 308 hp and 266 lb-ft (360 Nm). Upgrading to the all-wheel-drive model brings a rear motor producing 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm) for a combined 369 hp and 347 lb-ft (470 Nm). The FWD variant takes 9.5 seconds to complete the sprint, or just 6.9 seconds if you go with AWD. Both share a 103.4-kilowatt-hour LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery pack.
As far as range is concerned, we should point out that the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) differs greatly from the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) used in Europe. The Denza D9 electric model with front-wheel drive promises to cover 385 miles (620 kilometers) while its all-wheel-drive counterpart can do 373 miles (600 kilometers). Maximum charging power is 166 kilowatts, in which case 15 minutes enables a driving range of 143 miles (230 kilometers).
The D9 isn't Denza's only model at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show since BYD's sub-brand also has the purely electric N7. It's a five-seater SUV with a height-adjustable air suspension, panoramic sunroof, and a maximum driving range of 354 miles (570 kilometers). It'll take 20 minutes to juice up the battery from 30 to 80 percent thanks to 230-kW charging capabilities.
Denza is scheduled to reach the European market near the end of the year.

"Fiat's Retro EV Future Includes Panda City Car, Truck, SUV, Camper",https://insideevs.com/news/710144/fiat-panda-electric-city-car-truck-suv/,"Starting July 2024, Fiat will introduce one new model each year through 2027, with pure electric, hybrid, and ICE powertrains.",2/26/2024 11:00,"Italy’s beloved Fiat Panda, the best-selling model in the country and Fiat's most popular model in the rest of Europe will morph into several new segments for global markets, Stellantis revealed today.
The Panda nameplate, synonymous with fun, compact, and frugal city cars in Europe is on track to expand into an entire family of pure electric, hybrid, and gas-powered models. These powertrains will go into a new City Car, SUV, camper, pick-up truck, and sporty fastback.
Fiat CEO and Stellantis Global CMO Olivier Francois indicated that the brand would showcase these concepts at the upcoming 2024 Geneva International Auto Show which begins on February 27, 2024, in the mountainous Swiss town. He said, “Fiat is working on a bigger and a better future. A future that is rooted in its Italian past, tradition, fun, sustainability, and social relevance.”
The Fiat Panda is Italy's best-selling car.
The Panda is extremely popular in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. And Fiat wants to bank on its success with a new range of pure electric, hybrid, and gas-powered Pandas that will take several shapes and sizes and ride on a brand-new ""multi-energy"" platform. However, no mention of a U.S. launch for now.
Stellantis revealed last year that it would introduce seven new affordable models on a new multi-energy low-cost Smart Car platform, different from STLA platforms. The Citroen e-C3 rides on this platform, which has been designed specially to democratize new-generation and affordable EVs and fend off the brutal onslaught of Chinese rivals.
“We are in the global game, and the next step will be to raise that global game with a set of new models,” Francois said. “[The new models will] conquer the streets, and complete our line-up in Europe, South America, Middle-East and Africa,” he added. The first model will likely be the immediate Panda successor, a slightly larger city car with a radical new design.
The design language would be based on Fiat’s birthplace, the Lingotto building in Turin, and its famous rooftop test track. And that means “oval shapes everywhere.” Additionally, all models would feature abundant recycled plastics, and fabrics made from bamboo, so that “ethics and aesthetics,” go hand in hand.
The City Car concept would feature what Fiat calls a self-winding charging cable to make plugging and unplugging easier. In the video, the cable pops out from the hood, connects to the charger, and seemingly retracts automatically. Other exterior design highlights include light steel wheels, pixel headlight modules, and the new four-stripes Fiat logo.
Fiat will also introduce a successor to the Strada truck, which is apparently the best-selling vehicle in Brazil. The concept seems to be a modern take on the traditional truck, with a modular bed and roof. In one frame, its pixel headlight modules come off and get mounted on the roof as adventure lights.
Other models include an “XXL sized” camper, a family-oriented roomy SUV, and a sporty fastback with a sloping roofline focused on performance. Francois said that Fiat will reveal the first production car in July 2024, with one model launching each year thereafter till 2027. Curiously, there was no mention of any of these models arriving in the U.S., not even the pick-up truck.
Europe, South America, and the Middle East seem to be the main markets for the Panda’s electric and hybrid offspring. “In Geneva, you will see many dream cars and concepts. But what I have just shown you is no dream. It’s reality,” he said.

Renault 5 Returns As Retrolicious EV With Up To 248 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/709693/renault-5-ev-2024-specs-details-official/,The modern reinterpretation of the Renault Le Car can power your appliances and has Google Maps and Waze built-in.,2/26/2024 4:00,"This is the all-new Renault 5. An electric four-door hatchback that revives the iconic nameplate once slapped on France’s best-selling car–the same which was known as the Le Car in the United States for a relatively short stint in the 1970s.
It looks almost identical to the concept car that was unveiled in 2021, which says a lot about Renault’s confidence in its design department. We think it looks very cool, but you can chime in with your thoughts in the comments section below.
The quintessential French hatchback goes all-electric
The first-gen Renault 5 from the 1970s was France's best-selling car for a good number of years. In the U.S. it was sold as the Le Car and had far less success than in Europe. Now, though, there's an all-new Renault 5, and this time it's electric.
First, the specs. The all-new Renault 5 is based on the so-called AmpR Small platform, which was previously known as the CMF-B EV architecture. It’s intended for B-segment EVs and it will also be the foundation for the upcoming Renault 4.
More Stories Like This
The 5 will be available with two battery options, both using the Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) chemistry. The entry-level pack boasts a capacity of 40 kilowatt-hours and offers a WLTP driving range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), while the bigger option has 52 kWh and increases the maximum estimated range to 400 km (248 miles).
Renault says that the larger battery consists of just four large modules with 46 cells in each module, while the smaller pack has three modules, each with 31 slightly larger cells. This approach is different from that used on the discontinued Zoe hatchback, which uses twelve smaller modules, and helps save some 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in weight. The Renault 5’s big battery weighs about 280 kg (617 lbs) and the smaller one tips the scales at 240 kg (529 lbs).
Speaking of weight, the new urban EV has just 1,450 kg (3,196 lbs) when fitted with the 52-kWh battery pack, making it as light as some comparable internal combustion engine cars.
When it comes to size, the Renault 5 EV slots somewhere between the Twingo and Clio hatchbacks, measuring 3.92 meters (154.33 inches) long, 1.77 m (69.6 in) wide, and 1.5 m (59 in) tall. In other words, it’s about 10 inches shorter than the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV but the width and height are almost the same. The trunk has a volume of 326 liters (11.5 cubic feet) and by the looks of it, there's no frunk. However, the automaker says there's a special compartment in the trunk to store the charging cable.
The 5 is front-wheel-drive only and there are three power options: 70 kW (93 hp), 90 kW (120 hp), and 110 kW (147 hp). The first two can only be had in combination with the 40 kWh battery, while the most powerful motor only comes with the larger, 52 kWh pack. Going from zero to 62 miles per hour (0-100 kilometers per hour) takes less than eight seconds, according to Renault, presumably for the most powerful version.
All versions can be recharged from an AC source at up to 11 kW. As for DC fast charging, the car can accept up to 80 kW if it’s fitted with the 90 kW, while the top variant can accept up to 100 kW. A rather cool feature is a charging indicator on the hood.
Furthermore, the two most powerful versions of the Renault 5 come with vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality as standard, meaning owners can export power from the high-voltage battery to power things like appliances and tools. The maximum power output is 3.7 kW.
The French EV also comes as standard with Plug & Charge, which means the owner doesn’t have to swipe a card every time the car needs to be recharged, and vehicle-to-grid (V2L). The latter means the car can be used to inject power back into the grid when it’s convenient, price-wise. The first European markets where the Renault 5 owners will be able to use this feature will be France and Germany this year and the United Kingdom in 2025.
Inside, all versions of the compact EV come with a 10-inch central touchscreen that can run native Android apps like Spotify, Google Maps, Waze, and more. It also has wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. A second 10-inch screen (7-inch in the case of the entry-level trim) takes the role of a digital instrument cluster.
The design of the seats is inspired by the flame-throwing R5 Turbo and the fabric used to cover them is made from 100% recycled materials. The dashboard and door panels of some trims are also made from recycled plastic.
There’s also a virtual travel companion called Avatar Reno, which supposedly interacts with the driver and passengers, both inside and outside the car. And because it integrates with the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, it can reply to questions using basically the whole internet as its source of information.
Driving the Renault 5 is supposed to be quite fun, too, according to its maker. The EV boasts the same front suspension as the gas-powered Clio and Captur, while the rear gets a multi-link setup that’s usually found in larger and more expensive cars, according to Renault.
Adaptive cruise control with stop & go and lane centering are part of the pack and make for a Level 2-capable EV. This means that the car can partially drive itself but the driver is still responsible for everything and has to take over control when the vehicle says so.
The new Renault 5 E-Tech Electric will be built in France, where multiple factories will contribute to making the EV. The car will be assembled in Douai, while the battery pack will be initially made at the Ruitz factory before passing the torch to the Douai facility. Prices will start at around 25,000 Euro (roughly $27,000) without incentives and deliveries are set to begin later this year on the Old Continent.

Jeep Is Preparing Five New Or Refreshed Models For 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/709929/what-jeep-is-planning-2025/,"The all-electric Wagoneer S goes on sale in Q3 2024, while the smaller Recon will launch by the end of the year.",12/25/2024 9:04,"2025 will be a big year for Jeep. It’ll have two battery-electric vehicles on sale and a larger lineup of plug-in hybrids. Jeep’s new CEO, Antonio Filosa, briefed the media Friday about the comapny’s plans for the upcoming year and its strategy to increase its market share.
The Jeep Wagoneer S will enter production in the second quarter of this year before going on sale in Q3 for a short 2024 model year run. It’ll be the fastest Jeep ever when it goes on sale, hitting 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S have 600 horsepower and ride on Stellantis’ scalable STLA Large platform, just like the new Recon, which should launch before the end of the year. Jeep wouldn’t provide specific dates for Recon’s production and arrival, but it will have its first full sales year in 2025 alongside the Wagoneer S.
Jeep’s lineup of 4xe plug-in hybrids will grow through next year. One model likely to arrive is the previously announced Gladiator PHEV, with Jeep planning to launch five new models or updated variants in 2025. The revamped lineup is part of the brand’s strategy to increase its market share in the US after five consecutive years of falling sales.
Ready For Off-Road Fun:
Jeep is already laying the groundwork for a successful 2025. It's lowered the prices of several models for 2024, including the Grand Cherokee and the recently updated Gladiator, and it’ll integrate the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer into the Jeep brand. The Wrangler also got an update for this model year. Filosa has also implemented a new team to improve quality and lower costs.

The Ineos Fusilier Is The Retro Electric Off-Roader Of Your Fantasies,https://www.motor1.com/news/709875/ineos-fusilier/,Ineos' second vehicle is a smaller EV with a range extender option and squared-off retro looks.,12/25/2024 9:05,"Ineos Automotive revealed on Friday its third vehicle, an all-electric SUV called the Fusilier. Like its first SUV, the Grenadier, the Fusilier sports a squared-off, retro-inspired design. In addition to a purely electric variant, Ineos will offer the Fusilier with a gas-powered range-extender option.
The Fusilier will deliver ""world-class off-road capability with zero compromise to on-road performance,"" according to Ineos. Shorter and lower than the Grenadier, the Fusilier will be built on a skateboard platform featuring a steel top hat, a steel underbody, and aluminum doors.
Ineos has yet to release details on the Fusilier's 4x4 powertrain, so we don't know things like battery size or range.
“As we developed this vehicle, we quickly concluded that in order to move towards decarbonization but continue making cars that consumers want to drive, we need a mix of powertrain technologies,"" CEO Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. ""BEVs are perfect for certain uses: shorter trips and urban deliveries, but industry and governments need to have realistic expectations around other technologies that can help accelerate the necessary pace of change.""
Going by photos released by Ineos, the Fusilier looks to have some real off-road chops, with all-terrain tires, a front skid plate, and high bumpers. The hood and door designs remind us of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class. According to Top Gear, the shorter, lower silhouette and things like active grille shutters were used to improve efficiency.
Ineos says it partnered with Magna to develop the Fusilier. The SUV will be built at Magna's facility in Graz, Austria. It joins cars like the G-Class, the BMW Z4, the Toyota Supra, and the Fisker Ocean as other cars contracted to be built by the company.
Expect more news from Ineos on the Fusilier's powertrain and launch details by Fall of this year.

"Mercedes-Benz Delays Its EV Plans, Will Keep Making Combustion Engines",https://insideevs.com/news/709767/mercedes-benz-delays-ev-plans/,"The company initially planned to be all-EV by 2030, but it said today that EVs will make up 50% of its sales by the end of the decade.",2/22/2024 18:28,"There’s no longer an expiry date on Mercedes-Benz combustion engines. Due to the recent trends of slower-than-expected demand for EVs, the German automaker is recalibrating its EV transition pace, cutting down the number of electric models it expects to sell by 2030 in half, the brand announced today in an investor statement.
Earlier, Mercedes-Benz had pledged to go fully electric by 2030, and permanently consign its combustion engines to the history books by then. But it now plans to continue selling ICE cars well into the next decade. It has halved its EV goals, and pure electric models and hybrids will account for up to 50% of its sales by 2030.
Mercedes-Benz wanted to go all-electric by 2030.
But that's no longer the plan. The pace of EVs has outpaced consumer demand, which is why several automakers are rethinking their EV approach. Widespread EV adoption is still in the pipeline, but probably not at the same pace as some previous forecasts.
“Unexpected developments may arise in particular from geopolitical events and trade policy,” Mercedes-Benz said in the statement. “Further supply chain disruptions and in particular, availability bottlenecks for critical components, remain a significant risk factor,” it added.
However, the brand would remain “strategically focused” and “tactically flexible,” as it awaits for demand to catch up, charging infrastructure to mature, and the supply chain to streamline. Following the latest development, the carmaker's stock price went up 5.9% and was also supported by a $3.3 billion share buyback program late on Wednesday.
Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen an EV on-slaught from the German automaker in Europe. Even in the U.S., Mercedes-Benz now offers six pure electric models, including the EQB SUV, EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs, and the opulent EQS SUV Maybach. It also sold a record number of EVs in 2023.
Even though Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius has pledged for his company to go fully electric, he has also stated that the internal combustion engine would die a natural death and that Mercedes-Benz wouldn’t transition “artificially.” In a nutshell, Mercedes-Benz ICE cars would continue to exist as long as customers want them.
How the carmaker plans to continue developing its electrified powertrains would be worth keeping an eye on. Reports emerged in August 2023 of Mercedes-Benz developing its M252 engine to function as a range-extender—a set-up where the engine works as a generator to charge the EV’s battery and functions independently from the electric motors that actually drive the wheels.
The Ramcharger, some Geely models in China like the Galaxy L7 SUV, as well as the BMW i3 and Chevy Volt are range extenders. The technology improves the EV’s overall driving range by reducing reliance on the battery alone, providing increased flexibility, and eliminating range anxiety for drivers. But the caveat is it still needs fossil fuels for power, which is quite contradictory to what the EV and climate movement is all about.
Next-generation Mercedes EVs are expected to ride on the Modular Mercedes Architecture (MMA), which would be designed for EVs and ICE cars as well. The production version of the new CLA, whatever it will be called in its final form, will be the first model to ride on the MMA followed by the next GLA and GLB models.

The Super-Cheap Dacia Spring EV Can Now Power Your Appliances Too,https://insideevs.com/news/709379/dacia-spring-ev-facelift-2024-specs-details/,"With incentives, this electric runabout can cost as low as $13,000 in some places.",2/21/2024 2:00,"The Dacia Spring might not ring a bell in the United States, but in Europe, it’s known as one of the cheapest electric cars on the market. It’s small, it doesn’t have a lot of range, and it’s not particularly powerful, but with a price as low as $13,000 (12,000 Euro) after incentives, it’s hard not to consider it when buying a new car for urban driving.
And now it’s better than ever because the Romanian (but Chinese-made) EV got its biggest overhaul yet, at least when it comes to looks. Oh, and it has a frunk now.
Dacia Spring gets a makeover
The Dacia Spring, which is one of the cheapest EVs available in Europe, got a significant facelift that brings V2L and new looks.
We’ll get the hard specs out of the way first because nothing changes compared to the outgoing model. There’s the same 27-kilowatt-hour battery (gross capacity) that enables a WLTP-rated range of around 140 miles (225 kilometers) and the same two electric motor options: 33 kW (44 hp) and 48 kW (64 hp).

Charging can still be done via an AC source at up to 7.4 kW, while DC fast charging–which is optional–tops out at 30 kW. According to Dacia, Spring drivers only travel an average of 23 miles a day, so these stats should be more than enough for short urban driving sessions.
That said, this second facelift (the first design tweaks were introduced last year when the more powerful motor also made an appearance) brings significant design changes and a very interesting feature for such an affordable car: vehicle-to-load (V2L). Granted, the output isn’t anything to write home about–roughly 3.5 kW (220 volts at 16 amps)–but it’s still better than nothing. With V2L, owners can use an adapter to power things like appliances and tools using the car’s battery as a sort of mobile generator.
Design-wise, almost everything is new, both inside and out. The front end now features Dacia’s signature Y-shaped LED daytime running lights while the rear gets segmented tail lights and a full-width black strip that includes the Romanian carmaker’s name.
The roof rails of the outgoing model are no longer offered, as Dacia says they’re not really needed for a city car, and by the looks of it, almost all body panels are new. However, Renault’s CMF-A platform that underpins the car is the same as before.
Inside, the refreshed Spring gets a 7-inch configurable instrument cluster on all trim levels and a 10-inch infotainment touchscreen on the center console on the most expensive versions. The entry-level variant gets an integrated smartphone holder instead of the 10-inch screen.
There’s also a redesigned center console, a new height-adjustable steering wheel (the old model didn’t offer any adjustment), and refreshed door cards, and the rotary gear selector has been replaced with a switch that has a B mode for energy recuperation. However, the manual handbrake handle is still there, for better or worse.

Dacia Spring (2023) interior
The facelifted Dacia Spring’s interior can also accommodate what the company calls YouClip accessories–things like cable ties, smartphone holders, and bag supports that clip into cutouts in the dashboard.
The size of the Spring remains largely unchanged. The length went down from 145.8 inches (3.73 meters) to 145.6 in (3.70 m), but the trunk capacity went up by 8% to 10.8 cubic feet (308 liters). Plus, there's a 1.23 cu ft (35 liters) frunk now that's big enough for the Level 1 charging cable.
Three versions of the Spring will be available in Europe later this year: Essential, which only comes with the 33 kW motor, Expression, which can be specced with either motor, and Extreme, which gets the more powerful 48 kW drive unit.
The outgoing model had a base price (without incentives) of around $24,900 (23,000 Euro). The prices of the refreshed Spring haven’t been announced yet, but we expect them to be similar to what was previously available.",Iulian Dnistran
"The New Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid Is Less Powerful, More Expensive",https://www.motor1.com/news/709282/porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid/,"536 hp for $126,800.",12/25/2024 9:05,"When Porsche introduced the third-generation Panamera last November, it only showed the base model with rear- and all-wheel drive alongside the hot Turbo E-Hybrid. Zuffenhausen is now diversifying the lineup by launching two additional electrified models. They're not traditional ""Turbo"" models, but they swap the big V8 in favor of a V6 and keep the pair of turbochargers.
The Panamera 4E Hybrid combines a 2.9-liter engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 463 horsepower and 479 pound-feet. Compared to its predecessor, the new model has gained eight mighty horses but has lost 37 lb-ft. Despite its heft, this is a seriously quick sedan (it's technically a hatchback) since it takes just 3.9 seconds to reach 60 mph, or 0.3s less than the model it's replacing. Flat out, it'll do an identical 174 mph.
The Panamera 4S E-Hybrid now has 536 hp and 553 lb-ft, which means Porsche has sacrificed 16 horses while carrying over the same amount of torque. It completes the sprint in 3.5 seconds as before, en route to 180 mph, down by 5 mph.
All electrified Panamera models share an upgraded battery pack with a capacity boosted by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours without increasing the physical size. The battery provides juice to a beefier e-motor mounted within the automatic transmission, rated at 187 hp and 331 lb-ft.
Porsche isn't disclosing range details for the US-spec models for now. However, we know the European ones can travel on electric power for up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) in the case of the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and 92 kilometers (57 miles) for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. These WLTP figures are likely to decrease for the EPA-certified range.
In the US, Porsche wants $115,500 for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and $126,800 for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. The new models command a premium of $6,500 and $7,600, respectively. For your money's worth, an adaptive air suspension and matrix LED headlights are standard. To sweeten the pot, 14-way comfort seats, a heated steering wheel, soft-close doors, and lane change assist are included as well.
The order books will open in late March, and you'll pay an extra $1,995 for delivery and handling fees. The cars will hit dealers this fall.

The Cupra Born VZ Is An Electric Hot Hatch With 322 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/709322/cupra-born-vz-debut-specs/,The Volkswagen Group is trying to spice up its EV offerings.,12/25/2024 9:05,"Spun off from the Volkswagen Group's SEAT brand in 2018, Cupra is introducing its first electric performance vehicle. The sporty derivative is based on the Born compact model and gets the ""VZ"" suffix, which is an acronym for ""veloz""—Spanish for ""fast."" The brand's first-ever EV gets a healthy power boost and other upgrades.
The rear-wheel-drive electric hot hatch uses an upgraded motor delivering 322 horsepower and a massive instant torque of 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters). These output figures represent a huge boost of 94 hp and 235 Nm (173 lb-ft) over the previous most potent variant of the Cupra Born. Courtesy of the newly unlocked electric oomph, the VZ variant shaves off a full second from the sprint to 62 mph (100 km/h), which now takes 5.7 seconds. Top speed has gone up by 25 mph (40 km/h) to 124 mph (200 km/h).
There's more to the Born VZ than a beefier e-motor since Cupra is also giving it a pair of exclusive 20-inch wheels, including a forged set with performance tires. The cooler alternative to the troubled SEAT brand has bumped the battery pack's net capacity by 2 kWh to 79 kWh for an estimated range of 335 miles (570 kilometers). The steering is sharper and there are additional tweaks to the suspension for better handling while the brakes feel more direct than before.
In terms of styling, Cupra is offering the new Born VZ in this Dark Forest color or you can play it safe by getting the feisty electric hatch in Midnight Black. The newly added “VZ” logo on the tailgate has a dark chrome look to echo the “Cupra” lettering. Inside, it gets a pair of body-hugging seats not shared with the lesser models. However, these bucket seats are already available in some performance cars with a combustion engine, including the Formentor VZ5 with its inline-five engine borrowed from Audi.
For the range-topping Born, Cupra has upped the infotainment's screen size by 0.9 inches to 12.9 inches. More important is the touch slider to adjust the climate and volume since it's finally illuminated. At an additional cost, buyers can get an optional 10-speaker, 425-watt Sennheiser sound system. As standard, the VZ variant gets paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel to choose from one of three levels of energy recuperation.
The Born VZ will go on sale in Europe in the third quarter of the year. Also in 2024, we should see its equivalent Volkswagen version, the ID.3 GTX, or whatever name the sporty electric hatchback will use. These two will compete in a rarified segment that includes the MG4 XPower. The smaller Alpine A290 will join them soon.

Volvo Renames The XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge To EX40 And EC40,https://insideevs.com/news/709294/volvo-xc40-recharge-c40-recharge-renamed/,"Now, all the EVs in the Swedish automaker’s portfolio start with the letter E.",2/20/2024 9:00,"The Volvo XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge were the first mass-produced battery-powered models made by the Swedish company. But since their introduction a couple of years ago, Volvo’s all-electric portfolio has been steadily growing and now includes names like the EX30, EX90, and EM90.
As you can see, there’s a naming difference between the oldest and newest offerings, and–to make matters worse–Volvo also sells plug-in hybrid versions of the XC40 and C40 that are also called Recharge in some markets. But not anymore.
Volvo goes all-in on the letter E
Volvo is renaming its first EVs to make it easier for customers to understand its all-electric portfolio. From now on, the XC40 Recharge EV will be known as the EX40, while its coupe-shaped C40 Recharge EV brother will go by EC40.
The Geely–owned Scandinavian automaker has officially renamed the XC40 Recharge EV to EX40 and the C40 Recharge EV to EC40, streamlining its naming scheme and making it easier for the customer to understand what’s being offered.
More Volvo Stories
Furthermore, the plug-in hybrid versions of the XC40 and C40 will no longer carry the Recharge badge and instead will go by the T6 or T8 suffix that’s used to reflect the different levels of power output.
Besides the name change, Volvo is introducing a new Performance software pack for the Twin Motor versions of the EX40 and EC40 which increases the power output by 25 kilowatts (33 hp) for a total of 325 kW (436 hp). The software upgrade also includes different pedal mapping for quicker acceleration response and a “Performance” drive mode.
The upgrade can bought by customers via the Volvo Cars smartphone app and then applied through an over-the-air software update without having to visit a service center.
Lastly, the Swedish automaker is introducing a special Black Edition of the EX40, EC40, and XC40 models that come with Onyx Black paint, high gloss black badging, 20–inch five-spoke alloy wheels in high gloss black, and the choice between microtech or textile charcoal interiors.
Last year, Volvo sold over 265,000 plug-in cars worldwide–113,000 all-electric vehicles (up 70% compared to 2022) and 152,000 plug-in hybrids (up 10%). By 2030, the Swedish automaker wants to have an all-electric portfolio.",Iulian Dnistran
The Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Is An Electric Passat Wagon With Up To 425 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/709154/vw-id7-tourer-debut-specs-range-cargo/,"WLTP estimated range, that is. Plus, it comes with ChatGPT built-in.",2/19/2024 12:05,"Say hello to the all-new Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, VW’s first-ever series-production all-electric wagon. It has the same face as the sedan but a rear end that can fit a lot more stuff, making it a good choice for people who need more room to haul things on a daily basis, all while keeping the emissions level to zero. As long as they live in Europe, that is.
The ID.7 Tourer comes hot on the heels of another recent electric wagon unveil–the BMW i5 Touring–but unlike the BMW, VW’s offering should be a bit more affordable. We don’t know the official pricing of the new ID.7 Tourer yet (some estimates say it will start at around $50,000), but it’s sure to be less expensive than the roughly $78,000 BMW is asking for for the base i5 Touring.
The ID.7 EV gets a wagon makeover
This is the Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, the German company's first electric wagon. It comes with the same bells and whistles as its fastback-bodied sibling but has a larger trunk that can fit more stuff.
VW’s family hauler gets the same guts as its fastback sibling, meaning a choice of two battery packs. The entry-level ID.7 Tourer Pro gets juice from a 77-kilowatt-hour pack that can accept up to 175 kW of power from a compatible DC fast charger for a 10 to 80 percent top-up in about 28 minutes. The ID.7 Tourer Pro S gets a slightly bigger, 86-kWh battery that can be recharged at up to 200 kW, which means that going from 10 to 80% state of charge should take “significantly less than 30 minutes,” according to the German automaker.
More Electric Wagons
VW doesn’t say what the expected range of the entry-level battery pack is, but it does mention that the big pack has a “forecasted” maximum range of 685 kilometers (425 miles) on a full charge, presumably on the WLTP cycle, as the ID.7 Tourer won't make it to America. And if there’s something we know about range estimates, it’s that the WLTP figures are usually 20% more optimistic than the EPA numbers. In other words, the window sticker might say 340 miles of range if the electric wagon was to ever come stateside.
Whatever the battery pack, though, the ID.7 Tourer will be available with a single source of motivation in the form of a rear-mounted electric motor that makes 210 kW (281 hp) and 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters) of torque. It’s the same APP550 electric drive system that powers the sedan version of the ID.7 and is touted as being more powerful and efficient than the APP310 unit that powers the entry-level ID.3 EV.
Furthermore, the battery is automatically preconditioned for fast charging when using the so-called Electric vehicle Route Planner–just set a DC fast charger as a destination on the navigation system and the car will take care of the rest.
When it comes to hauling cargo, the ID.7 Tourer can accommodate up to 21.3 cubic feet (605 liters) of stuff with the rear seats in the cargo position (in other words, with the seatbacks in their most upright position), while the total capacity is 60.5 cubic feet (1,714 liters) with the rear seats folded and cargo up to the roof. With the rear seatbacks reclined, the cargo space is 18.7 cubic feet (532 l).
Just like the ID.7 sedan, the Tourer EV comes with a pretty long list of standard equipment including ED headlights and tail lights, an augmented reality head-up display, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, and the artificial intelligence bot known as ChatGPT, which can respond to all kinds of requests through the car’s IDA voice assistant.
As an option, the ID.7 Tourer can be specced with a smart glass panoramic roof that can be made opaque at the press of a button thanks to its polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) layer.
Interestingly, the ID.7 Tourer has exactly the same dimensions as the ID.7 fastback, which is pretty rare in the automotive industry. Both measure 195.3 inches (4,961 millimeters) long, 73.3 in (1,862 mm) wide, and 60.4 in (1,536 mm) tall, while the wheelbase is 116.9 in (2,971 mm). Usually, the wagon version of a sedan is longer, but not this time.
The Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer will go on sale later this year in Europe. Here in the U.S., only the fastback version of the ID.7 will be available starting in the second half of 2024.
Update: this article has been tweaked to better reflect the fact that the ID.7 Tourer will not be available in the United States.",Iulian Dnistran
The Cadillac Lyriq Gets Some Nice Upgrades In March,https://insideevs.com/news/709032/cadillac-lyriq-update-march/,GM paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV. But at least the Cadillac Lyriq launch is going more smoothly.,2/16/2024 17:30,"Cadillac Lyriq owners can expect some nice upgrades to their cars in March, General Motors said on Friday. It's a bit of positive news during the otherwise choppy rollout of GM's new electric platform.
The software update adds a few improvements. Perhaps most notably, Super Cruise, GM's hands-off highway-driving system, should require fewer interventions from drivers after the update. Similar improvements are headed for the Lyriq's hands-on adaptive cruise control feature, which automatically follows lane lines and keeps up with traffic—under driver supervision, of course.
Caddy's first EV
The Lyriq is the first Cadillac EV of many the brand plans to release in coming years. GM has hit some stumbles in its EV plans, but at least things are coming along for the Lyriq.
The upgrade also includes more convenient touchscreen controls for the garage door opener and glove box, along with better performance in the myCadillac mobile app.
The nice thing about today's software-heavy vehicles is that upgrading them with new and improved features is easier than ever. Interestingly, though, Lyriq owners will have to go to a dealer to receive this upcoming update. They won't be able to just download it through the internet.
GM's transformation into a fully zero-emission automaker hasn't been terribly smooth as of late. It struggled to ramp up production of EVs, that use its new Ultium battery technology, including the Lyriq. It recently paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV after reports of software glitches. And it's delayed the launch of some new electric models, citing lower-than-expected consumer demand.
But the Lyriq is something of a bright spot. After a slow start to 2023, GM wound up selling 9,154 Lyriqs last year. That's not a huge number, but it beat out the automaker's other new EVs by a long shot.
GM sold just 482 Blazer EVs, 3,244 GMC Hummer EVs, and 461 Silverado EV pickups. It's worth noting here that GM's electric best sellers were the aging Bolt twins. The Bolt EV hatchback and Bolt EUV compact SUV were responsible for a combined 62,045 sales, but they've been discontinued (in their current iteration) to make way for GM's next-gen EVs.

"Sony And Honda Have Three New EVs On The Way, Including An SUV",https://www.motor1.com/news/708807/afeela-sony-honda-suv-and-compact-coming-2025-2027-2028/,"Plus, a sedan and a more affordable compact are also on the way.",12/25/2024 9:05,"Sony Honda Mobility is the automotive joint venture between Honda and Sony. It aims to build electric vehicles with advanced self-driving technology. Now, there are new details about when the company's first models will hit the road.
In addition to the previously announced Afeela electric sedan coming in 2025, Sony Honda Mobility will launch an SUV in 2027 and a less expensive compact model in 2028 or later, according to Nikkei Asia. All three vehicles will ride on the same platform.
Sony Honda Mobility's compact model will allegedly share components with Honda's in-house developed EVs to keep prices down. The company just showed off the Saloon concept at CES ahead of launching a production model in 2026.
We don't have many details about Sony Honda Mobility's SUV yet. Sony previously showed the Vision-S 02 concept (below) that previewed how such a vehicle might look. It shared a design language with the sedan but with a taller ride and a hatchback.
The Afeela sedan launching in 2025 uses front and rear electric motors, each making 241 horsepower. It has a 91.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Sales in the United States should start in early 2026.
Sony Honda Mobility is loading the Afeela with technology. The pre-production model has 45 sensors, including lidar and eight cameras. Chips from Qualcomm would allegedly provide the processing capability to support Level 3 self-driving, meaning a person would still need to take over control at times.
The Afeela has an understated, smoothly styled exterior. Inside, there's a screen spanning nearly the entire dashboard. Sony intends to provide access to its massive media empire so folks can watch movies like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse or play Fortnite on this display. The driver grips a yoke steering wheel.
Honda would build some of these EVs in Ohio, according to Quartz. Given the location, the vehicles might use the batteries coming from Honda and LG's joint venture factory in the state.

"GM’s Super Cruise Now Works On 750,000 Miles Of Roads",https://insideevs.com/news/708783/gm-super-cruise-update-2024/,The update nearly doubles the number of highway miles in North America where users can drive hands-free.,2/15/2024 11:13,"Super Cruise, General Motors’ advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), is getting a big update that will almost double the number of highway miles where owners of compatible cars can activate the feature.
Drivers of GM-made cars like the Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade iQ, and GMC Hummer EV–just to name a few–will be able to use Super Cruise on 750,000 miles of highways in the United States and Canada by next year. The previous road network update, which came in 2022, had roughly 400,000 miles of compatible roads.
GM doubled the number of Super Cruise highway miles again
Owners of compatible GM-made cars will be able to use the company's Super Cruise hands-free driving assistant on 750,000 miles of highways in the United States and Canada. This latest update almost doubles the number of compatible miles that were previously available (the 2022 update included 400,000 miles of highways.)
General Motors claims that it has “the largest truly hands-free operating domain in North America.” If you’ve never heard of Super Cruise, think of it like Tesla’s so-called Autopilot, only instead of letting the car figure out what the road is like, GM mapped every single mile of compatible highway with the help of Lidar.

Besides features like changing lanes on demand or automatic lane changes–which tech-savvy drivers expect from such a system–Super Cruise also offers something called hands-free trailering. In other words, it enables hands-free driving on compatible roads while towing, which GM says is a first in the industry, and Super Cruise is still the only ADAS on the market to offer something like this.
This latest update adds minor highways that typically connect smaller cities and townships, and compatible cars have already started receiving new data over-the-air, with more to come through 2025.

Speaking of compatible cars, the Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Cadillac CT6, and Cadillac XT6 won’t get this latest update and will likely be stuck with one of the previous versions of Super Cruise. According to Chevrolet’s website, the Bolt EUV only has 200,000 miles of mapped highways. As for the rest of GM’s portfolio, the company says that “the average eligible vehicle will update its map within about one month of the GM brand site maps showing updated roads.”
Super Cruise debuted in 2017 as a Level 2 semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on certain roads in North America. Then, in 2021, something called Ultra Cruise was introduced, which was supposed to be an even more capable version of the hands-free driving assistant, but that was ultimately retired and its functions will be included in Super Cruise.",Iulian Dnistran
The 2024 Ypsilon Is Lancia's First New Car In 13 Years,https://insideevs.com/news/708706/2024-lancia-ypsilon-ev/,The troubled Italian brand signals rebirth with its first-ever EV.,2/14/2024 16:30,"We never thought this day would ever come again, but here is a new Lancia. Stellantis has pledged to keep all 14 (fourteen!) brands in its vast portfolio following the FCA-PSA merger. That means the Italian marque is getting a new chance to repair its severely damaged brand image. The 2024 Ypsilon kicks off a long overdue rebirth.
It is also Lancia's first-ever EV, although mild-hybrid versions with gasoline engines will follow. The subcompact hatchback uses the same CMP / eCMP bones as the Peugeot 208 / e-208 but with entirely different styling inside and out. Some of the design cues were first seen last year on the Pu+Ra HPE Concept that had a bit of Stratos DNA.
Lancia tells us the headlights and taillights take after those of the iconic rally car but that's frankly a bit of a stretch. The circular rear lights do remind us of the Stratos, but so do other cars with round taillights. The Stellantis brand has integrated a ""Y"" motif into both front and rear lights, while the separate daytime running lights adopt a similar theme. To spruce things up, the wheel arches, side mirrors, and the rear pillar come with a glossy black finish.
It's worth noting the version depicted here is a limited-run special edition co-developed with Cassina, a high-end Italian furniture manufacturer. Consequently, lesser versions of the new Ypsilon won't look as glitzy as this. Compared to the Peugeot 208 and its regular rear door handles, Lancia has opted to ""hide"" them up in the C-pillar where you'll also notice the company's updated badge.
The interior is also a vast departure from its French cousin. However, since we're in 2024, the ""mandatory"" dual-screen setup is there. Thankfully, there's still a row of physical buttons to quickly access some of the climate controls. The dual displays measure 10.25 inches and Lancia has added a wireless charging pad, three USB-C ports, and smartphone integration with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The chic city car also has a bespoke sound system, ambient lighting, and a special filter for the AC to get rid of 99 percent of harmful particles.
At the heart of the 2024 Lancia Ypsilon in electric guise is a front-mounted motor good for 154 horsepower and 260 Newton-meters (191 pound-feet) of torque to match the Peugeot e-208. It uses an identical 51-kWh battery pack that has enough juice for up to 250 miles (403 kilometers) in the WLTP combined cycle. This electric motor and battery combo is also found in another related Stellantis product, the Opel e-Corsa.
At 4.08 meters (160.6 inches) long and 1.76 meters (69.2 inches) wide, the all-new Lancia Ypsilon is bigger than the outdated model it replaces. At 1.44 meters (56.7 inches) tall, it's slightly lower compared to its predecessor. Predictably, it's a lot heavier. The electric model tips the scales at 1,584 kilograms (3,492 pounds) but subsequent mild-hybrid gas versions will trim off some of the fat. Speaking of the chunky battery, it can be recharged from 20 to 80 percent in 24 minutes via a DC connection.
While the old Ypsilon was only sold in Italy, its replacement is going to be offered at more than 70 dealers across Europe. Belgium and The Netherlands will get the ball rolling in the middle of this year, with France and Spain to follow, and Germany in 2025. Lancia wants to attract a younger clientele (people aged 40-45) with its ""premium hatchback,"" which is the last model to get combustion engines.
After the Ypsilon, Lancia's resurrection will continue in 2026 when the ""Gamma"" moniker will be dusted off for a flagship model. It's going to be a fastback on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform and will measure nearly 4.7 meters (185 inches) long. In 2028, the ""Delta"" will return as a compact hatchback.
Both future models are going to be electric-only products since Lancia's goal is to sell only EVs from 2028. It means the yet-to-be-revealed Ypsilon with a mild-hybrid gasoline engine will be offered for only a few years.

It's cool, but it likely won't come to the United States.",12/25/2024 9:05,"It was only a matter of time before the cute Fiat 600 got a sportier Abarth version. And here it is, the Abarth 600e, the most powerful car to come from the long-running Italian brand.
Abarth didn't confirm a ton of details in announcing the 600e, but did say that the EV makes 240 horsepower. That's a solid 85 hp increase over the smaller, 155-hp Abarth 500e. The Abarth 600e launches with the limited Scorpionissima edition, featuring a vivid coat of Hypersonic Purple paint. Abarth will build 1,949 examples of the 600e Scorpionissima in honor of the 75th anniversary of the company's founding year.
Other upgrades include wider tires on 20-inch wheels, a beefed-up braking system, and a mechanical limited-slip differential. And in typical flamboyant Abarth fashion there's a large ""Abarth"" decal just above the side sills and a neon-green-accented scorpion logo on the front fender.
This is not the first Abarth Seicento, though. Back in the 1950s and 1960s when Abarth was still an independent tuning and motorsports firm, it used the original Fiat 600 as a basis for a number of fascinating models. Some used modified 600 bodies with larger-displacement engines, while others, like the Fiat-Abarth 750, sported streamlined coachwork from Zagato.
Cool though the new Abarth 600e is, don't expect to see it in the US. While Fiat will bring the 500e EV here, it hasn't announced plans to do the same with the 600e.

The limitless bounty of options make these perfect daydreaming tools. On Tuesday, Porsche revealed the heavily revised 2025 Taycan, and inevitably, we're playing with its configurator.
For this fantasy scenario, I've gone a little extreme with a Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo. Like myself, it's sporty and practical. While there's a great selection of standard colors available for the new Taycan, I went with Signal Yellow from the expansive Paint-to-Sample palette. It's a crazy $13,150, but I'm not spending real money here, so why not have some fun.
Signal Yellow is a lovely shade that was popular in early ""longhood"" 911s, and it's the perfect match for the optional ""Pepita"" interior trim. This houndstooth-esque cloth was also available in early 911s, and it's recently made a comeback as Porsche embraces retro colors and materials. And in the Turbo S, it's a no-cost option. I think it's fun to reference the original 911 with a car that has, uh, over 800 more horsepower.
Otherwise, I didn't go too crazy. I added Porsche's InnoDrive drive-assist system, surround-view cameras, ""Thermally & Noise Insulated Glass,"" and deleted the standard yellow paint on the brake calipers for gloss black. The only other big-ticket item is Porsche Active Ride, the automaker's new fully active suspension system, which costs $7,140. It's a lot of money, but a fascinating piece of technology.
When you add in the $1,995 destination fee, my Taycan costs a not-insubstantial $241,205. That's 911 GT3 RS money. Obviously, the Signal Yellow paint is a very expensive option, and getting rid of that brings the MSRP to $227,775... which is still a lot of money. But as I said before, the Porsche configurator lets us live in a wonderful fantasy land, and why not take full advantage? I bet you, dear reader, will too.

Ford's Developing A Cheap EV Platform To Fend Off Tesla And Chinese EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/707658/ford-cheap-ev-platform-farley/,"A small ""skunkworks"" team within Ford has been working on a low-cost EV platform for two years, Ford CEO Jim Farley said on Tuesday.",2/6/2024 18:53,"A small team within Ford has spent the last two years developing a low-cost platform for smaller electric vehicles, CEO Jim Farley said on Tuesday.
""We made a bet in silence two years ago,"" Farley told investors during the company's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call, describing the creation of a ""super-talented skunkworks team"" that operated outside of the ""Ford mothership.""
Affordability is a sore spot in the EV transition
Inexpensive, long-range EVs are tough to come by, and that's bad news for getting mainstream buyers to embrace electrification. Some automakers are working on cheaper upcoming models.
""They've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large install base for software and services,"" Farley said. He added that Ford is adjusting its spending to focus more on smaller electric vehicles.
Affordability is one of the key barriers keeping people from buying more electric cars—and keeping automakers from selling them in larger numbers. Today, most battery-powered cars carry premium price tags, and budget-conscious buyers have few options to choose from that cost less than $30,000.
None of Ford's current electric offerings are what one might consider ""cheap."" The Mustang Mach-E SUV starts at roughly $43,000, while the base F-150 Lightning pickup goes for over $55,000. More range and lusher appointments will cost you even more. Even so, Ford's EV business is far from profitable in these early days. (Its Model e division, dedicated to electric vehicles and related technologies, posted a $4.7 billion loss for 2023.)

The low-cost segment is an emerging battleground in the EV space. For years, Tesla has floated plans for a $25,000 vehicle. In January, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the firm's cheaper-to-build, next-generation vehicle platform will enter production in 2025. Farley said on Tuesday that cutting costs will be crucial for competing both with Tesla's upcoming cars and with Chinese manufacturers, which are beginning to export EVs worldwide and may come for the U.S. market next.
""All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost, and efficiency, in our EV products,"" he said. ""Because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs.""",Tim Levin
"The 2025 Porsche Taycan Gets Major Upgrades In Range, Performance And Charging",https://insideevs.com/news/707643/2025-porsche-taycan-specs/,"The Taycan Turbo S is now the quickest production car Porsche has ever sold, but charging and range may be the real wins here.",2/6/2024 18:01,"Performance was never the Porsche Taycan's problem. It is a Porsche, after all, and that's kind of what they do there. Instead, the German automaker's first all-electric effort never blew anyone way with its range. Granted, it was always positioned as a performance car first and foremost, and even something like a 911 Turbo S won't get amazing fuel economy. But Porsche says many of its more than 150,000 Taycan customers to date wanted to go the distance and spend less time charging, so that's what engineers wanted to deliver with an extensive 2025 model year update.
Meet the 2025 Porsche Taycan, which brings significant upgrades to range, charging times, efficiency and performance to the entire lineup.
Porsche's electric tip of the spear
First launched in 2019, the Taycan was Porsche's first all-electric effort—but not its last. Like the rest of the Volkswagen Group, Porsche has big plans for future EVs, including the new all-electric Macan. Now the Taycan gets some improvements for the next phase of its existence.
Unlike the all-new, all-electric Porsche Macan, the 2025 Taycan does not use the latest PPE platform. Instead, it rides on the same platform it's used since its 2019 debut—dubbed J1. But the revised Taycan does bring several major enhancements, including a new high-performance battery pack, a new rear-axle motor with more power, a modified pulse inverter, upgraded thermal thermal management with a new heat pump, and a tweaked all-wheel-drive system with more efficient regenerative braking. It also comes with more standard features than before, an expanded list of options and a slightly tweaked design with better aerodynamics.
This is the upgraded model that, in Taycan 4S trim, achieved an impressive 296 miles of range during a rainy, chaotic InsideEVs test drive. Other testers with better weather achieved far better results, including as much as 382 miles of range in internal testing of the base Taycan and up to 345 miles for the mighty Taycan Turbo.
Of course, official, EPA-estimated range figures are still forthcoming. But considering the outgoing Taycan was only rated between 200 and 242 miles of range, depending on the model, the 2025 update is sure to keep you on the road much longer. It's worth noting, however, that the last Taycan had one of the most conservative range ratings out there. In InsideEVs testing, multiple variants of the Taycan outperformed their official EPA range ratings by over 30%.
Porsche says that the 2025 Taycan will come in two body styles, the Taycan sedan and the slightly lifted, more wagon-like Taycan Cross Turismo. Both surviving flavors of Taycan get the same significant upgrades when they go on sale this summer.
The Sport Turismo model, which was previously only available here in GTS trim, will not be available for the U.S. market when the car launches, Porsche officials said.
Every Taycan model is at least 0.6 seconds quicker to 60 mph than the car it replaces. The base rear-wheel-drive Taycan sedan now accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, down from 5.1 seconds on the outgoing car. The range-topping Taycan Turbo S does even better; it can now move from zero to 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds, making it ""the quickestproduction car Porsche has ever offered.""
I'm putting that in quotes so you know I'm not making it up, but that alone is a staggering achievement. (Especially for a car that doesn't even have a turbocharger.)
We also know that the Taycan Turbo S develops up to 938 horsepower, but power output specs for the other models have not been released. Pricing details have, however, and can be found in the chart below.
And though our recent range test was mostly straight-line highway driving, the Taycan is unlikely to be any sort of slouch in the handling department. The 2025 models all include an adaptive air suspension as standard, and the new Porsche Active Ride suspension can be ordered as an option for all models with all-wheel drive. That's a fully active system with motors that can pump fluid in and out of each damper on the fly, offering a remarkably versatile and super-controlled handling experience.
Here's what Porsche says about that system, which is also available on the Panamera:
The suspension keeps the body of the Taycan level at all times, even during dynamic braking, steering and acceleration. With a smooth ride, the system absorbs bumps almost completely. In dynamic driving situations, the Porsche Active Ride suspension aims for an optimal connection to the road thanks to a balanced distribution of wheel loads. If the appropriate mode is activated, the suspension can compensate for pitching and rolling motions in order to reduce the acceleration forces acting on the occupants.
Sounds like a good time.
But plenty of expensive EVs can drive fast. The big news here is how much better this Taycan is in terms of range and charging speeds than the car it replaces.
Porsche says top Taycan models can be had with a larger 105 kWh Performance Plus battery pack, up from 93 kWh on the last Taycan. ""We increased it 12% [in size] and we changed the chemical density, therefore it's more powerful than before,"" Taycan program director Steffen Christian told me recently. ""It helps with the performance and it helps with the range as well.""
The smaller battery pack gets an upgrade as well. Previously a 79 kWh unit, the Performance Battery now has a capacity of 89 kWh. That's standard on the Taycan and Taycan 4S; the larger Performance Battery Plus is an option for those two. Meanwhile, the 105 kWh unit is standard on the Turbo and Turbo S models, as well as all Cross Turismo models.
No matter which battery you choose, the Taycan can take a lot of juice. Provided you can find such a DC fast charger, the car can charge at speeds of up to 320 kW, up from a max of 270 kW with the old Taycan. We even saw slightly higher numbers than 320 kW during our range test, although the cars had a 350 kW Electrify America stall all to themselves when we achieved those speeds.
Porsche added that all Taycan variants, regardless of battery size, can charge from 10 to 80% in 18 minutes ""under ideal conditions,"" which again tracks with our testing last week. Between the overall charging speed and the time used to do it, this now makes the Taycan one of the quickest-charging EVs for sale in the U.S. Credit to the Taycan's 800-volt electric architecture. Porsche also says the 2025 model gets a 150 kW DC/DC converter to better optimize charging speeds on 400-volt networks.
Finally, the Taycan now recovers 30% more energy during braking than before, up to 400 kW from 290 kW. One-pedal driving remains unavailable, as Porsche—like the rest of the Volkswagen Group—finds coasting to be better for efficiency and the overall driving experience than the alternative setup found on competing EVs.
On the outside, the enhancements fall under ""blink and you'll miss it."" The headlights are slimmer than before, but Christian told me they also slightly improve the car's aerodynamics too. The Taycan always sported a handsome silhouette; designers didn't need to mess with much, and they didn't. It does come in a number of new color options.
The inside also gets some subtle tweaks, including two new leather-free upholstery options, a standard Mode Switch toggle on the steering wheel, a ""push-to-pass"" temporary speed-boost button there similar to other Porsches, video streaming for the central and passenger displays and a revised software interface.
More features that were previously options on the Taycan are now standard. Those include Lane Change Assist, a heated steering wheel, ambient lighting, the intelligent range management system on the navigation, a new cooling system, wireless device charging and more.
As impressive as its range and charging performance was last week, we only got a few hours' seat time in the updated 2025 Porsche Taycan. We'll know a lot more when we get to test it in Europe later this year.
In the meantime, Porsche's O.G. electric effort has clearly matured from an impressive first draft to an on-paper masterpiece—one of the quickest-charging, longest-driving EVs on the market and one with performance far and above most rivals. Porsche may be busy getting everyone amped about the new electric Macan, but it may have also made the Taycan one of the most advanced EVs you can buy right now.

Correction: Porsche mistakenly said that the Taycan sedan models would be available in the course of the summer this year, while Cross Turismo models would follow in the fall. The automaker now says both body styles are expected to arrive this summer.

The BMW i5 Touring Is The Electric Wagon You Want But Can't Have,https://insideevs.com/news/707102/bmw-i5-touring-electric-wagon-forbidden-fruit/,"Unless you're in Europe, of course. There’s also a plug-in hybrid version of the German wagon that’s a solid “nein” in the U.S.",2/6/2024 18:01,"The BMW i5 is the all-electric version of the world-famous 5 Series sedan, and now–for the first time–there’s also a battery-powered version of the 5 Series wagon. Plus, the German company is offering a plug-in hybrid version of said wagon both in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive guises.
Bet let me get to the bad stuff first. Neither the BMW i5 Touring nor the 5 Series Touring plug-in hybrid is coming to the United States, with a previous press release shredding Americans’ dreams of ever getting their hands on the electrified wagons with the following sentence: “The unique combination of sporty elegance, modern functionality, and locally emission-free driving pleasure is developed specifically for the automotive markets in Europe as well as in Japan and Taiwan.”
The 5 Series wagon goes all-electric
The BMW i5 Touring is the German company's first-ever series production all-electric wagon. It comes with a bigger trunk than the sedan but, unlike the sedan, it won't be offered in the United States. In fact, none of the 5 Series' wagon options are available here.
BMW is referring to all the powertrain options available for the 5 Series Touring, which include plug-in hybrid gasoline options, mild-hybrid diesel burners, and all-electric trims. That said, it doesn’t mean we can’t dream–an all-electric wagon, especially one that’s branded as a premium product, is somewhat of a unicorn in the automotive industry.
We could say that the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo is sort of a wagon, and there’s also the Nio ET5 Touring that’s available in China and Europe, but that’s about it. Sure, the MG5 exists, but that’s marketed as an affordable electric wagon, and Volkswagen's ID.7 Tourer isn't on sale yet.
So, what does the i5 Touring offer? Well, a bigger trunk than its sedan sibling, for starters. BMW says the wagon has a cargo volume between 570 and 1,700 liters (20.1 to 60 cubic feet), irrespective of the powertrain version. By comparison, the i5 sedan–which is sold in the United States–has 490 liters or 17.3 cubic feet.
This, together with the different body style, is the only thing that separates the electric wagon from the sedan. The battery, electric motors, charging capabilities, and gizmos are the same.
The base i5 Touring carries the eDrive40 badge and comes with a single rear-mounted electric motor that makes 230 kilowatts (308 horsepower) in day-to-day driving conditions and 250 kW (335 hp) when My Mode Sport mode is activated. The same goes for the torque, which is rated at 295 pound-feet (400 Newton meters) but goes up to 317 lb-ft (430 Nm) for a short period when Sport Boost or Launch Control is enabled.
The WLTP driving range of the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring is between 300 and 348 miles (483 to 560 kilometers).
The most powerful version of the zero-emissions wagon is called the i5 M60 xDrive Touring and comes with a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for 380 kW (509 hp) most of the time and up to 442 kW (592 hp) when you choose to live dangerously. Torque is also higher, with 586 lb-ft (795 Nm) available all the time and up to 604 lb-ft (820 Nm) when M Sport Boost or My Mode Sport is active.
But with more power usually comes less range, and it’s no different for the i5 M60 xDrive Touring, which can travel between 276 and 314 miles (445 to 506 km) on a full charge.
More Electric Wagons
Speaking of charging, the i5 Touring accepts up to 205 kW of power from DC sources and up to 11 kW from an AC source (a 22 kW onboard charger is also available as an option).
On the plug-in hybrid front, the 5 Series Touring comes in either 530e or 530e xDrive guise, both of which combine a 2.0-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor to make a combined output of 220 kW (295 hp) and 332 lb-ft (450 Nm). The all-electric driving range is between 49 and 59 miles (79 to 96 km) on the WLTP cycle thanks to a 19.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The all-electric i5 comes with an 81.2-kWh high-voltage pack.
Pricing for the BMW i5 Touring starts at 72,200 Euros in Germany, which is about $78,600 and includes VAT.

Rivian Will Finally Reveal The R2 Electric SUV On March 7,https://insideevs.com/news/707427/rivian-r2-unveil-on-march-7-2024/,Rivian’s R2-platform EV will be made in Georgia and is expected to rival the Tesla Model Y.,2/5/2024 13:31,"Roughly two and half years after California-based electric vehicle start-up Rivian launched its first models—the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV—the brand now appears to be poised to unveil its next big EV on March 7, 2024.
It’s been a long time coming. We already know that the upcoming model will wear some sort of R2 badging, but the exact model names remain undisclosed. What we do know is that the first R2 model will be a mid-size SUV or crossover, and likely lock horns with the Tesla Model Y, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and more.
Rivian's more affordable car has an official reveal date.
California EV startup Rivian's first two models—the R1T truck and R1S SUV—earned a reputation for being quirky and fun to drive. But with a starting price of over $73,000, they are out of reach for most people. With the R2 models, Rivian hopes to target a larger audience.
Given how obsessed America is with crossovers, evident with the Model Y’s astronomical sales, it’s logical for Rivian to set its sights on this immensely popular segment. The extent to which the R2 EV might pose a threat to the Model Y will depend on several factors, including pricing, range, fast charging capability, and the brand’s ability to deliver volume sales, among others.
Rivian’s current offerings, the R1T and R1S have a starting price of $73,000 and $78,000, respectively, before fees and tax incentives. These prices make them out of reach of the masses. But Rivian hopes to sell the R2 EV at a much lower price point. CEO RJ Scaringe indicated previously that Rivian hoped to fill a “vacuum” in the $45,000-50,000 price range.
The R1T and R1S are manufactured at Rivian’s inaugural plant in Normal, Illinois. The R2 models are expected to be manufactured at a second site, a brand new $5 billion factory east of Atlanta, Georgia. Rivian earlier indicated that it intended to start production of the R2 models in 2026 after the Georgia plant’s completion.
The upcoming R2 model will also use Tesla’s proprietary charging connector. Rivian confirmed in June 2023 that its future models will get the NACS charging port, giving owners access to thousands of additional charging stations across the U.S. That’s pretty much all we know so far about the R2 EV. Further details will follow in due course.
What’s your outlook for the Rivian R2 EV? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

Toyota Is Developing New Combustion Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/706930/toyota-developing-new-combustion-engines/,The company chairman believes people should have a choice rather than being forced to buy EVs.,12/25/2024 9:05,"Toyota sold more cars in 2023 than ever before but electric vehicles had a minimal impact on the growth. Of the 11,233,039 vehicles delivered by the Japanese conglomerate, only 104,018 were EVs. Just 0.926 percent of the cars sold by Toyota, Lexus, and the other subsidiaries last year were battery EVs. With that in mind, the company reckons there's still a need for combustion engines.
During a speech held in front of 200 corporate managers and executives, Chairman Akio Toyoda reaffirmed plans for a ""major engine development project."" His statement is in line with an announcement made at the 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon where he ""used the opportunity to tell everyone that we're going to keep doing engines.""
During the Q&A session, Toyoda expressed his belief that battery EVs will never exceed a market share of 30 percent, regardless of technological advancements. As a result, the remaining 70 percent will be represented by gasoline cars, hybrids, and fuel cell EVs. The firm's chairman also mentioned that hydrogen-burning combustion engines could potentially offer a solution. Diesel was not mentioned.
While addressing questions from journalists, Toyoda didn't solely focus on decarbonization. He also touched on the delicate matter of jobs:
""If we suddenly shift to BEVs, I'm sure the 5.5 million people in Japan's auto industry who have spent their lives working on engines will start to question, 'What was it all for?' Some of our engine-related suppliers can't even get banks to lend them money.""
We've reached the point where the announcement of a new combustion engine comes as a surprise. In 2024, automakers are predominantly focused on revealing plans for new EVs. Some even go as far as claiming they'll cease production of ICE cars in the coming years. For instance, brands like Jaguar, Chrysler, Lotus, Aston Martin, Bentley, Buick, Cadillac, Rolls-Royce, Genesis, Maserati, Mini, Opel/Vauxhall, and Volvo have committed to becoming purely electric by the end of the decade. Even Toyota's Lexus brand has pledged to halt sales of cars with combustion engines by 2035.
In Europe, Stellantis promises to sell only EVs by the end of the decade. Mercedes also intends to go fully electric on the Old Continent by 2030 but only ""where market conditions allow."" Archrival Audi will stop making cars with combustion engines in 2032. BMW has not set a cutoff date yet. The Volkswagen core brand aims to only make EVs in Europe from 2033.
Toyota sees things differently, as it believes battery EVs can't be the sole solution to achieve carbon neutrality. Akio Toyoda mentioned that the charging infrastructure is far from being ready, pointing out that ""a billion people live without access to electricity"" worldwide. Since Toyota sells cars in those regions, going all-in on EVs wouldn't make sense.

"BMW Brings 5 Series Plug-In Hybrid To U.S., i5 Gets Another Trim",https://insideevs.com/news/706869/bmw-5-series-phev-i5-xdrive40-us-launch/,"The new variants make for a comprehensive 5 Series line-up for the U.S., offering customers gas, PHEV, and BEV options.",1/31/2024 13:00,"BMW is expanding its 5 Series model line-up in the U.S. with a new plug-in hybrid variant and a new i5 trim. Additionally for 2024, BMW is also adding Level 2 driver assistance capability to some existing U.S. models.
Currently, there are two variants of the BMW i5 available to order in the U.S.: the rear-wheel-drive i5 eDrive40 with 335 horsepower and a starting price of $66,800 (excluding delivery fees), and the mighty i5 M60 with 593 hp and an MSRP of $84,100.
The U.S.-bound xDrive40 will slot between the two trims mentioned above. It comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive, with a total system output of 389 hp and 435 pound-foot of torque. BMW says the i5 xDrive40 will sprint from 0-60 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds, 0.5 seconds faster than the RWD model, but slower than the ferocious M60 which does the job in a neck-snapping 3.7 seconds.
Enabling this raw performance is a battery with 84.3 usable kilowatt-hours, which delivers an EPA-estimated range of 295 miles on the eDrive40 and 256 miles on the M60. Expect the incoming xDrive40’s range to be somewhere in between those two figures.
The i5 supports 11-kilowatt AC charging, and up to 205 kW of DC fast charging, the latter enabling 10-80% state of charge (SoC) in under 30 minutes, provided there’s a functional and fast enough charger around. As with pretty much every other carmaker in the U.S., BMW will also adopt Tesla’s NACS connector, so i5 owners should have more charging options in 2025.
Moving on, BMW has also confirmed the stateside arrival of the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid. The PHEV launched in Germany in September 2023, alongside the 530e which the U.S. won’t get. The 550e is powered by a 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder engine mated to a 197-hp electric motor. Combined system output is 483 hp and 516 lb-ft.
Its 19-kWh battery allows an all-electric range of up to 55 miles on the European WLTP cycle. Expect the EPA figure to be lower than the optimistic WLTP number.
BMW will also add Highway Assistant to its $2,500 Driving Assistance Professional Package. It will allow hands-free driving with supervision at speeds up to 85 mph. It will also enable active lane change with eye activation where the car can suggest a lane change, and the driver can confirm simply by looking in the outside rearview mirror. However, this feature will only be available for certain models produced from March 2024 onwards, and that includes the i5.
The production of the 2025 BMW i5 xDrive40 will begin in March 2024 at BMW Group Plant Dingolfling in Germany. The model will cost $71,095 in the U.S., including delivery and handling fees. The production of the 550e PHEV will begin in July 2024, and pricing and additional details will follow at a later date.

All-Electric Mini Aceman Aces Testing In Extreme Temperatures,https://insideevs.com/news/706651/mini-aceman-extreme-temperature-testing/,The British company’s smallest crossover will show its uncamouflaged face in China in April.,1/30/2024 18:01,"The all-new Mini Aceman, which is basically the electric crossover version of the latest-generation Mini hatchback, is on the last leg of its development process after completing all the necessary tests in extreme temperatures.
For extreme cold, engineers took the all-electric Aceman to the Arctic Circle to put the charging system, battery thermal management system, and electric motors to the test. Then, the battery-powered crossover was shipped to the desert to do the same–but this time in temperatures of up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).
Mini gets the Aceman EV ready for prime time
The Mini Aceman, which is the British automaker's smallest electric crossover, is getting ready for its world premiere in April after completing the extreme conditions testing procedures.
It’s a vital part of a new vehicle’s development process that should ensure the car can withstand just about any treatment once it goes on sale. It’s a standard practice among established automakers and Mini is no exception here. Only in this case, it’s probably more important than with any other model in its refreshed lineup to make sure everything is right from the get-go.
The Aceman will be Mini’s smallest crossover, and as we all know, the world loves cars that look like SUVs, even if they’re actually smaller than a compact hatchback. Measuring 160.4 inches long and 69 in wide, the Aceman is 9 inches shorter than the soon-to-be-discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV and slots between the new Mini hatchback and the new Countryman crossover (which is now based on the same platform as the BMW X1).
Set to be unveiled in April at this year’s Auto China car show, the first-ever Mini Aceman will be available in two power versions, both front-wheel-drive only. The Aceman E will be powered by an 181-horsepower electric motor that gets juice from a 40-kilowatt-hour battery pack, resulting in a WLTP-estimated range of 186 miles. The more expensive Aceman SE will get 215 hp and a larger, 54-kWh battery pack that enables a driving range of 249 miles on a full charge.
Mini’s entry-level electric crossover will be built in China by Spotlight Automotive, a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group, Mini’s parent company, and Great Wall Motor. In 2026, Mini’s plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, will also begin manufacturing the electric three-door hatchback and the battery-powered Aceman. That said, we still don’t know if the Aceman will make its way to the United States.

The Wagoneer S will ride on parent company Stellantis’ BEV-specific STLA-Large platform (pronounced “stella”), which is also expected to underpin the Recon, the Wrangler-inspired electric SUV. Stellantis regards this platform as highly modular and scalable, as it supports FWD, AWD, and RWD configurations and can also house two different sizes of battery pack: 85 kilowatt hours or 118 kWh. The Wagoneer S will likely get the larger battery, but the range hasn’t been confirmed yet.
Inside the Wagoneer S, there’s ample digital real estate. The images reveal four large screens mounted across the dashboard: a large digital gauge cluster, a massive central infotainment display (which for some reason is playing a poignant song called “Moment of Surrender” by Nick Mulvey), and a dedicated screen in front of the co-driver’s seat, keeping up with the trend of passenger displays on many new luxury and premium software-defined EVs. The fourth screen is under the central display, and it appears to house the climate, seat, and massage functions.
The Wagoneer S also gets a shiny drive-selector knob with a silver metallic finish, and a terrain selector with Sand, Snow, Eco, Auto, and Sport modes, all housed on a piano black panel on the central console. There’s also a dual-pane panoramic sunroof, a “segment-exclusive” McIntosh 19-speaker audio system, and a color-selectable ambient light strip that runs across the door panels and the dashboard.
Early this month, Jeep said the Wagoneer S would pack 600 horsepower, and accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds. If that’s true it would certainly be among the fastest electric SUVs out there—and unlikely to be affordable. Expect more details to surface in the months ahead. It'll launch in the fall of 2024, with electric SUVs like the BMW iX and Rivian R1S in its crosshairs.",Suvrat Kothari
The 2025 Mazda CX-70 Delivers Straight-Six Power In A Two-Row Package,https://www.motor1.com/news/706547/2025-mazda-cx-70-first-look/,Turbocharged inline-six and plug-in hybrid powertrains make the jump to the five-seat SUV.,12/25/2024 9:05,"Mazda is doubling down on mid-size SUVs with the 2025 CX-70, a new variant of the CX-90 with seating for five instead of seven. The new SUV shares its platform, powertrains, and most of its bodywork with its larger sibling, meaning if you like the three-row, you’ll probably like the two-row as well.
Still, there are a few detail differences between the Mazda mid-sizers. For starters, the CX-70 is styled with a little more sportiness in mind, with greater use of gloss black than the chrome-laden CX-90. The grille gets a black mesh design in place of the CX-90’s brightwork, and the front bumper is different, with larger simulated grilles leading to the air curtain generators in the corners. The rear bumper also gets a new design, with faux vents on the corners. Dark finishes appear on the mirror caps, door handles, and roof rails, and the available 21-inch wheels get gloss black pockets and machined faces.
The front end looks more aggressive and appealing to my eye than the CX-90, whose flowing grille insert looks a bit swollen, like it got punched in the nose. However, the CX-70 still has a rounded roofline, which doesn’t sit quite right with the flowing bodywork and triangular rear quarter windows. There’s a bit of 1990s Taurus in the decidedly ovoid rear hatch, although the revised bumper design helps chisel out some visual verve.
Inside, the CX-70 looks remarkably similar to the CX-90, at least before you realize there isn’t a third row. Available red leather with a black accent stripe is a CX-70 exclusive, joining an otherwise black interior with contrasting red stitching on the door panels and steering wheel. Gray plastic trim with a printed carbon fiber motif detracts from otherwise excellent materials though, and I hope Mazda will offer the CX-90’s “kakenui” dashboard stitching and genuine wood trim, at least as an option.
Relative to the CX-90, the CX-70 has most of the same equipment, although it's the first Mazda to include Amazon Alexa integration in the infotainment system. It gives voice control to some on-board functions, like climate controls and infotainment, and it also syncs up with Amazon-capable in-home equipment. The CX-70 also has Unresponsive Driver Support as part of its adaptive cruise control and lane-centering functionality; if the person behind the wheel isn’t responding to an escalating set of prompts and warnings (as in the event of a medical emergency), the car will come to a gradual stop in its lane and activate its hazard lights.
The CX-70 uses the same powertrains as the CX-90, with a turbocharged 3.3-liter inline-six producing 280 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque in base form or 340 hp and 369 lb-ft for the high-output S. A plug-in hybrid powertrain is also available, making 323 hp and 369 lb-ft via a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 17.8-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, and 68-kilowatt electric motor.
Rear-biased all-wheel drive is standard across the board, with a 5,000-pound towing capacity for the six-cylinder and 3,500-pound cap for the hybrid. The CX-70 will be incrementally lighter than the larger CX-90 (final specs have yet to be announced), so it might also be a bit more efficient. An electric-only range of about 30 miles for the PHEV would be a tidy little upgrade, ditto a combined fuel economy rating of 26 miles per gallon for the six-cylinder.
The CX-70 rides on the same 122.8-inch wheelbase as the CX-90, and it's also nearly the same length – a Mazda representative confirmed that the revised bumpers may affect dimensions by a few tenths of an inch. But since it doesn’t have to accommodate a third-row seat, the CX-70 has a massive cargo area with extra storage below the floor. I was able to lay out completely flat and still had room above my noggin and below my toes, stoking the imagination for a cross-country journey, sleeping at rest areas and campsites along the way.
Mazda Goes Big:
Mazda hasn’t announced pricing, but it’s fair to assume the CX-70 will be a bit cheaper than the $40,970 CX-90 and $51,320 CX-90 PHEV. Plan on spending about $38,000 for a base-model CX-70, rising to $57,000 or so with every box ticked. The somewhat dated Honda Passport, by contrast, starts at $43,295 including destination, with the flagship Black Edition trim costing $49,365. The stately Toyota Crown Signia will also compete in this space, though pricing for that 243-hp hybrid hasn’t been announced either. The 2025 Mazda CX-70 will arrive in dealers later this year.

Porsche's New EV Macan Offers Fake Vroom Vroom Sounds For $490,https://insideevs.com/news/706536/porsche-macan-ev-engine-sound/,What would you pay to make your EV louder?,1/29/2024 15:54,"Porsche's first electric SUV is here. And if you're afraid that trading in your gas-fueled Macan for the upcoming battery-powered version will take all the fun out of owning a Porsche, fret not. The Macan Electric isn't your ordinary EV, offering up the option to blast theatrical, synthetic acceleration noises at passersby.
""Porsche Electric Sport Sound"" will cost you $490 on top of the new Macan's starting price of $78,800 (before a delivery fee). It's part of a laundry list of add-ons that can push the model's total price tag north of $160,000.
Fake engine sounds, coming to an EV near you
Porsche's first electric SUV isn't alone in this. Several car companies are pumping artificial acceleration noises into—and out of—their inherently quiet electric cars to make the driving experience more familiar and dramatic.
The option, listed under ""Performance"" in the Macan Electric's online configurator, ""enhances the vehicle’s own sound and makes it sound even more emotional—both outside and inside the vehicle,"" Porsche says. Owners can toggle the sound on and off as they like using the Macan's central screen.
Like many of the artificial propulsion soundtracks offered in today's EVs, ""Porsche Electric Sport Sound"" sounds like a cross between an alien spaceship and a combustion engine. It's equal parts futuristic drone and familiar rumble.
EVs are inherently quiet, making driving one a remarkably tranquil experience. But that's also led some companies to experiment with artificial acceleration sounds to fill the void and appeal to car buyers who might miss the drama of loud, sputtering gas engines. Typically, those soundscapes are pumped into the cabin via speakers, but some manufacturers are interested in making their EVs noisy to the outside world as well.
More Porsche Macan Stories
Porsche is one of them. Its Taycan electric sports sedan also offers a sound package. Drivers of Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, a high-performance electric SUV, can choose from a range of different sound profiles that mimic the swelling sound of gear shifts—even though it has a single gear. Dodge, known for its thunderous V8-powered muscle cars, showed off an electric concept car that's nearly as loud as a jet engine.
The new Macan is massively important to Porsche and the wider Volkswagen Group it belongs to. The small SUV is one of Porsche's top sellers, and the upcoming model debuts the VW Group's Premium Platform Electric architecture, which will underpin future EVs from both Porsche and Audi. All eyes will be on the Macan to see how that platform functions following all sorts of software stumbles and delays from VW.
It's not just about making it work. It's also about getting customers excited and keeping people safe, which is where the phony exhausts come in. Not only do they make EVs more entertaining, they could also save your life.
A 2022 study compared how pedestrians react to oncoming electric and gas-powered vehicles. It found that people were way worse at judging the time to collision for EVs accelerating toward them. Maybe making EVs sound a bit louder and more familiar could help.",Tim Levin
Maserati Confirms Quattroporte EV Coming In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/706170/maserati-quattroporte-ev-coming-2028/,Three other electric models will be launched before the flagship sedan.,12/25/2024 9:05,"Basically confirming the reports from last week about the delayed development of the Quattroporte Folgore, Maserati has shined more light on its EV strategy. It is now official that the electric version of the sedan is planned for release in 2028, but a few other battery-powered products should arrive before that.
The first to be launched will be the GranCabrio Folgore, which is scheduled to be unveiled later this year, closely following the release of its internal combustion engine counterpart. The company's commitment to the electrification journey extends well beyond 2024 with a zero-emissions version of the MC20 due in 2025. A large electric SUV - likely a BEV version of the Levante - is coming next in 2027, before the Quattroporte Folgore hits the market in 2028. Maserati describes all these models as 100 percent designed, developed, and manufactured in Italy.
""Driven by our Modena heart, we are going full throttle to lead change on electrification, with two of our iconic models already available for purchase in their 100 percent electric versions, and another on the way this year,"" Davide Grasso, Maserati CEO, comments. ""We will offer our preferred customers the most powerful Maseratis ever, pushing the boundaries of driving pleasure to a new era.""
The two electric products Grasso is referring to are the GranTurismo Folgore and Grecale Folgore, both of which are already on sale in the European Union. Maserati, under the Stellantis umbrella, became the first Italian luxury brand to focus on developing and producing all-electric vehicles. The Italian firm has also been participating in Formula E since 2023.
Driving Some Of Maserati's Latest Products:
The automaker’s electrification initiative is part of the larger Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan unveiled on March 1, 2022. The strategy positions the luxury brand as a fully-fledged segment within the organization matrix, ensuring that all new models from the marque will feature electric powertrains.
Not everything looks bright for Maserati, though. Stellantis will reportedly temporarily lay off 1,000 production workers at the firm's Mirafiori factory in Turin, Italy, from February 12 to March 3. This is the plant where Maserati produces the Quattroporte and other models.

Fisker Ocean Braking Issue That Prompted NHTSA Probe Was Fixed With An OTA Update,https://insideevs.com/news/706226/fisker-ocean-braking-issue-ota-software-update-nhtsa-probe/,The California-based EV startup claims it issued the software update in December 2023.,1/26/2024 14:00,"Fisker, the maker of the all-electric Ocean SUV, said it fixed the braking issue that prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to open a preliminary investigation after it received several complaints alleging the battery-powered crossover could display a partial loss of braking when it hits low traction surfaces.
According to an official document published by the American automaker on its website, the potential problems that led to the NHTSA’s preliminary evaluation were fixed with a software update that was issued last month.
Modern problems require modern solutions
Fisker used the power of over-the-air (OTA) updates to fix a braking issue that prompted the NHTSA to open a preliminary investigation after it received consumer complaints about the Ocean EV exhibiting reduced braking performance in some scenarios.
Here’s what the company said:
The Fisker Ocean brake system uses both friction braking and regenerative braking. In December 2023, Fisker responded to customer feedback and issued an Over-the-Air update (Version 1.10) to the regenerative system that improved the customer experience when traveling over bumps and uneven surfaces, resolving the issue. The Fisker Ocean brake system meets or exceeds all US and international performance requirements.
According to the NHTSA, it received nine consumer complaints about braking performance in the 2023 Ocean SUV. The complaints allege that a partial loss of braking can occur over low traction surfaces without alerting the driver, resulting in longer stopping distances. One complaint alleged a crash and injury, the federal investigation said.
The issue seemed to lie with the so-called blended braking function, which combines the friction braking system with the regenerative braking feature. About 4,000 cars out of the total 4,700 Ocean SUVs that were delivered last year are linked to the braking issue.
Fisker is in a hard spot right now. Last year, it slashed its production output at the Magna factory in Austria so that it could keep some cash on hand for the following months, and reduced its production guidance several times before that. That’s not exactly encouraging news for the EV startup. Neither is the fact that more than half the cars it made in 2023 were undelivered.
That’s partly because the direct sales approach used thus far didn’t quite live up to the expectations, which is why the California firm wants to add dealer franchises to its sales pitch. With help from dealers, it hopes to move all the remaining inventory of over 5,000 cars by the end of the first quarter–but only if enough dealers sign up.

"2024 Porsche Macan: A Daring Electric Redesign With 630 HP, More Range Than Taycan",https://insideevs.com/news/705983/2024-porsche-macan-electric-features-prices/,"With rear-axle steering, new-generation software, and more power and range, the second-gen Macan brings plenty to the table.",1/25/2024 7:30,"After selling 800,000 units of the first-generation Macan worldwide since 2014, Porsche breathes a new life into its best-selling model today in the form of a compact all-electric SUV. Meet the reborn Porsche Macan, now powered by batteries.
It's been a long time coming. Over the past few years, Porsche engineers have been driving Macan prototypes in deserts, through extreme winter in Northern Europe, and on public roads and racetracks, covering more than 2.1 million miles in testing alone. And they seem to have traveled everywhere with big fat cameras, making sure enthusiasts know what’s in the pipeline. Turning such a crucial model into an EV is a huge move for Porsche and the Volkswagen Group—a real test of its often-troubled plan to go all-electric in the coming years.
The Porsche Macan is a hugely important EV for the VW Group
The Macan has been Porsche's sales volume driver for years. It now debuts a new dedicated Volkswagen Group EV architecture called the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), gets more power and range, and offers a new generation of software that's crucial to the company's future.
This second-generation model, officially called the Macan Electric, will co-exist alongside its outgoing counterpart—and that car will keep internal combustion power for a bit. “The gas-powered Macan will continue to be sold in its current form as long as customer demand requires and/or regulations permit. We are happy to be able to offer our customers a choice of powertrain in this case for the foreseeable future,” a Porsche spokesperson told InsideEVs.
It’s an important EV for the brand that comes at a critical time. Not only does it debut Volkswagen Group’s Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture, but it also comes after several delays emerging from troubles at Cariad—VW Group’s software arm—when the likes of Tesla and several Chinese players have leaped forward with software-defined EVs.
The Macan Electric measures 188.4 inches long, 84.7 inches wide (with mirrors), and 63.8 inches tall, which is marginally longer and wider than the first-gen model, although the height remains identical. The wheelbase (113.9 inches) is 3.4 inches longer than the previous model, resulting in short overhangs at the front and rear to accommodate the floor-mounted lithium-ion battery.
It appears chic and athletic in pictures. The four-point DRLs are reminiscent of the Taycan, and Matrix LED lights—a highly sophisticated set-up that can dim or deactivate individual LEDs to avoid glaring other drivers while still illuminating the road ahead—are optional.
It has a remarkably low drag coefficient of 0.25—only slightly higher than the Taycan with 0.22 Cd, and almost as good as the Audi e-tron GT with 0.24 Cd. What makes this possible are several active elements: an adaptive rear spoiler, active cooling flaps on the front air intakes, air curtains below the headlight module, and a generally aerodynamic design, Porsche claims.
Other interesting design elements include frameless doors, a buffed-up shoulder line, and the characteristic coupe-like roofline which it carries over from the first-generation Macan.

The electric SUV will be available in two variants, Macan 4 and Turbo, both equipped with dual motors. The Macan 4 makes 402 horsepower and 479 pound-foot of torque, while the Turbo is good for 630 hp and 833 lb-ft. Those numbers would give all gas-powered Macan variants a run for their money. (As with the Taycan, the name ""Turbo"" must refer to speed and Porsche's heritage, since it obviously does not have a turbocharger.)
The Macan 4 accelerates from naught to 62 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds, while the Turbo slingshots in a neck-snapping 3.3 seconds. Top speeds are limited to 137 mph and 161 mph, respectively.
InsideEVs reviewed a near-production prototype last year in California, and we came out seriously impressed. Back then, contributor Tim Stevens wrote, “Dropping the Macan into Sport mode delivers an immediate and noticeable change in character. The throttle response immediately sharpens, and the suspension likewise stops being so soft and starts getting real.” He added, “The harder I pushed, the better it responded, really coming alive when I twisted the mode dial over to Sport Plus.”
Enabling this performance is a 95-kilowatt-hour usable battery capacity (100 kWh gross)—it’s only slightly larger than the optional Performance Battery Plus (93.4 kWh) on the Taycan, but much larger than its standard offering (79.2 kWh). Thanks to 800-volt architecture, it can charge at 270 kilowatts and is capable of adding a 10-80% range in 21 minutes, assuming it gets plugged into a fast enough DCFC.
The battery can deliver a range of up to 381 miles on the Macan 4 and 367 miles on the Turbo—but that’s on the European WLTP cycle which is slightly more optimistic than the EPA ratings here in the U.S. WLTP ratings are estimated to be 22% higher than EPA ratings, so going by this measure, expect the U.S. range to be around 300 miles for the regular version and slightly below that for the Turbo.
Those figures would still be substantially better than the Taycan, whose EPA ratings range between 200-246 miles depending on the variant and model year.
The new Macan can be configured to feature up to three screens: A free-standing 12.6-inch, curved gauge cluster, a 10.9-inch central display, and an optional 10.9-inch screen for the co-driver. What’s also new is the head-up display with augmented reality technology.
Porsche says AR elements such as navigation arrows will be visually integrated and the image would “appear to the driver at a distance of 32.8 feet and corresponds to the size of an 87-inch display.”
The new-generation infotainment system is based on Android Automotive OS (something we know works superbly in Volvos) and is also compatible with Apple Car Play.
We’ll have to wait and see how clean and responsive the user interface is on the new Macan, and the software experience is certainly something to look out for in early reviews of the final product. VW Group’s software division Cariad was comprehensively restructured in 2023 (including 2,000 job cuts) after users reported system freezes and unresponsive touchscreens on some VW EVs. That delayed the development of Cariad’s E3 1.2 software platform, as well as the Macan and the related Audi Q6 e-tron—both crucial cars for the VW Group.
The optional rear-axle-steering gives it a turning circle of 36.4 feet, almost as good as a Toyota Corolla. This feature will set you back by slightly over $2,000, and driving enthusiasts might find value in it. As Stevens said in his review, “[the rear steering system] is paired with an even sharper variable steering ratio to make the car feel almost too eager to get to the apex, a feeling that is utterly addictive.”
Thanks to the adaptive air suspension, the standard ground clearance of 7.2 inches can be raised to 8.8 inches. It also drives all four wheels thanks to dual motors, and Porsche's electronic traction management can respond to wheelspins in just 10 milliseconds.
Both variants are available to order in the U.S. The Macan 4 starts at an MSRP of $78,800 and the Macan Turbo is priced at $105,300, excluding delivery and handling fees. It will be manufactured at Porsche Plant Leipzig in Germany, alongside the Panamera and the gas-powered Macan.
U.S. deliveries will begin in the second half of 2024, and the electric SUV will take on rivals like the BMW iX, Genesis Electrified GV70, and the Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, to name a few.",Suvrat Kothari
The New Volkswagen Golf Plug-In Hybrids Have 62 Miles Of Electric Range,https://insideevs.com/news/705728/vw-golf-plug-in-hybrid-ev-range-2024/,The electrified versions of the German hatchback can also accept up to 50 kW of power from a DC fast charger.,1/23/2024 18:01,"The facelifted Volkswagen Golf is officially here, and while the all-electric version hasn’t magically reappeared in the German company’s lineup, the plug-in hybrid versions of the hatchback got significant improvements.
As before, the two plug-in Golfs are called eHybrid and GTE, the latter being a sort of electrified version of the iconic GTI.
The new plug-in hybrid Golf seems like a great choice for commuters
The facelifted Volkswagen Golf in plug-in hybrid variety offers up to 62 miles of all-electric range (in the WLTP test, we assume). It can also be recharged at up to 50 kW and has a maximum range of about 620 miles with a full tank of gasoline.
Both are powered by a 1.5-liter TSI eco2 gasoline engine that works in tandem with an electric motor that gets juice from a 19.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. According to Volkswagen, both versions can drive for up to 62 miles on electricity alone (on the WLTP cycle, we assume) and up to 620 miles in hybrid mode.
More Volkswagen Stories
Recharging the high-voltage battery can be done from an AC source at up to 11 kilowatts, or from a DC fast charger at speeds up to 50 kW.
Power-wise, the eHybrid makes a combined 201 horsepower, while the GTE ups the figure to a more hot hatch-like 268 hp, which is actually 6 hp more than what the GTI is capable of with its 2.0-liter engine. The eHybrid and GTE transfer power to the wheels via a six-speed dual-clutch gearbox (the GTI has a seven-speed DSG).
That said, we’ll only get the Golf GTI here in the United States, making us a bit envious of Europeans who can get their hands on the plug-in hybrids. That’s because they went through some serious upgrades that make them a compelling choice for drivers who spend time both in cities, where the all-electric range comes in handy, and on long trips, where the gasoline engine can alleviate the range anxiety that some EV owners experience on high-mileage trips.
Compared to the previous iterations, the new plug-in hybrid Golf versions have a high-voltage battery that’s 9.1 kWh bigger (19.7 kWh vs. 10.6 kWh previously), more all-electric range (62 miles vs 50 miles on the outgoing models), a slightly bigger gasoline engine (1.5 liters vs 1.4 liters before), and about 27 hp extra in the case of the GTE.
The charging speeds are also higher. The outgoing models could top up at 3.6 kW from a home charger (the new ones go up to 11 kW), and DC fast charging was non-existent.
Inside, there’s a new infotainment system that runs on VW’s fourth-generation MIB4 system. It brings new graphics, a new menu structure, and it’s simpler to operate than its predecessor.
Two screen sizes will be available for all of the new Golf versions, either a 10.4-inch touchscreen or a 12.9-inch unit as the top-of-the-line option. Beneath the screen, there are illuminated touch sliders for temperature and volume control, but they lack haptic feedback and there are no other physical knobs that can be used instead.
Volkswagen Golf GTE (2024) interior
Outside, the facelifted Volkswagen Golf features newly designed LED headlights, slightly revised LED taillights, and a new front bumper, so you’ll still be able to easily identify one if you see it down the road. Optionally, so-called performance headlights will be available as part of a package that includes a horizontal LED light strip in the radiator grille and an illuminated VW badge. Because BMW and Mercedes-Benz can’t be the only ones offering light-up logos on their cars, right?
But what about those plug-in hybrids? We think they would have a place here in the U.S. where long commutes are typically the name of the game. Let us know in the comments if you agree.",Iulian Dnistran
The New Porsche Macan EV Bares It All In Design Sketches,https://www.motor1.com/news/705532/porsche-macan-ev-design-sketches/,"Plus, Cadillac intends to show an electric V performance car in 2024.",12/25/2024 9:05,"Porsche shows the Macan EV in revealing design sketches, and Cadillac announces an electric V.

2025 Porsche Macan EV Design Sketches
It's safe to say that Porsche has never generated this much hype around a new product. Finally debuting on January 25, the next-generation Macan is being teased one last time in surprisingly revealing images. The design sketches complement the official photos fully showing the interior that were released at the end of last year.
Don't let the evolutionary styling trick you into believing the new Macan is related to the gas model. It sits on a different platform developed from day one exclusively for EVs. From the details released thus far by Porsche, the top version is going to have over 600 horsepower and 738 pound-feet (1,000 Newton-meters) from a dual-motor setup. The juice is going to be provided by a large 100.0-kilowatt-hour battery that can handle 270-kilowatt charging.
Porsche describes the 2025 Macan as a sporty crossover with a ""striking design"" and equipped with all-wheel steering. It'll be offered with a rear electronic locking differential and a sophisticated air suspension with two-valve dampers. Following its debut on Wednesday, it's slated to go on sale later this year when Audi will launch its equivalent model, the Q6 E-Tron.
While an official announcement has yet to be made, the Macan EV is widely believed to supersede the gasoline version in the European Union. Porsche apparently won't be allowed to sell the current crossover for much longer in EU countries because of forthcoming cybersecurity regulations.
Cadillac To Show Electric V Later This Year
The V series is about to enter the electric era as Cadillac has announced a zero-emission performance vehicle will break cover later this year. The disclosure was made during a media roundtable, where journalists were asked to ""stay tuned"" for an electric V model. Cited by Automotive News, a company spokesperson said enthusiasts should look forward to ""performance variants no matter the propulsion.""
It's unclear whether Cadillac was referring to a production model or a concept. Regardless, the CT4-V and CT5-V sedans along with the Escalade-V SUV with their powerful combustion engines will be complemented sooner or later by a hot EV. 2024 is an important year for GM's luxury brand and the V Series since it marks 20 years since the first production model, the 2004 CTS-V.

"BMW, Like Tesla, Will Use Humanoid Robots At Its U.S. Car Factory",https://insideevs.com/news/705378/bmw-figure-robots-car-plant/,"Between moves from Tesla and now BMW, it looks like AI-powered robots may have a place building cars of the future.",1/19/2024 15:01,"BMW is taking a page out of Tesla’s playbook by experimenting with artificially intelligent human-like robots at one of its car plants. Figure, a California startup developing said humanoids, announced a deal with BMW on Thursday to “deploy general purpose robots in automotive manufacturing environments.”
Of course, robotics in car manufacturing isn’t anything new. Car companies have steadily automated the way vehicles are built over the years. But the machines currently in operation are programmed to do one thing over and over—like move a door panel from here to there or weld this to that. Figure’s robots, on the other hand, would be able to do a whole bunch of different tasks that are overly tedious or unsafe for human workers, the company says.
Will humanoid robots take over jobs at automotive factories?
BMW, like Tesla, thinks that humanoid robots have a spot at automotive factories. They may, but don't expect them to perform complex tasks anytime soon.
""Single-purpose robotics have saturated the commercial market for decades, but the potential of general-purpose robotics is completely untapped. Figure's robots will enable companies to increase productivity, reduce costs, and create a safer and more consistent environment,"" Brett Adcock, Figure’s founder and CEO, said. Adcock also founded Archer Aviation, an electric air taxi company.
BMW and Figure will identify where robots can fit into the carmaker’s manufacturing processes before letting them loose—in stages—at the carmaker's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. That’s where BMW assembles the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and XM SUVs.

Standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall, the Figure 01 can carry 44 pounds, operate for five hours on a full charge and walk at a speed of 2.7 miles per hour. Figure, which emerged from stealth in 2023, aims to deploy the robot across industries like warehousing, logistics and retail to start.
Tesla is working on a similar robot called Optimus, which it plans to unleash on its factory floors to do manual labor. Elon Musk has said Optimus could also serve as a personal butler and that Tesla’s robotics division will someday eclipse its car business. (By the way, Hyundai already employs camera-equipped robot dogs from Boston Dynamics, which it owns, to do quality control.)
In the auto world, human jobs are already under threat by regular-old automation and the rise of electric cars, which are simpler to build and require less labor than their combustion-powered counterparts. If humanoid robots become smart, skilled and, crucially, cost-effective enough for car companies to use in significant numbers, we could see the automotive workforce erode further. For what it's worth, Figure says on its website that there are 10 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and that it sees robots as a solution for filling roles people don't want.
The robot takeover of complex manufacturing processes isn't happening tomorrow; Figure’s robot just learned how to make coffee.
Granted, it learned how to use a Keurig, basically the simplest coffee machine to operate on the planet. But the fact that it learned to do so just by watching people make coffee for 10 hours is extremely cool and impressive. See it in action here:",Tim Levin
"EV Jeep Wagoneer Hits 60 In Just 3.5 Seconds, Has 600 HP",https://www.motor1.com/news/705195/jeep-wagoneer-s-ev-teaser/,"Jeep's first US-bound electric vehicle is a high-powered Wagoneer, set for a fall 2024 launch.",12/25/2024 9:05,"Jeep announced Thursday it plans to launch its first US-bound electric vehicle, the Wagoneer S, in the fall of 2024. To go along with the announcement, the brand released a short teaser video, a single image of the car, and a couple of impressive stats: 600 horsepower and a 0-60 time of ""around"" 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S is exclusively a battery-electric vehicle, says Jeep. It'll come with Jeep's 4xe-branded all-wheel drive as standard, along with the company's all-terrain management system.
There's no word on battery size, trims, motor tech, or pricing for the Wagoneer S right now. We suspect Jeep will trickle out more details as the fall 2024 on-sale date approaches. The SUV will go on sale in the US first before hitting ""key markets around the world"" later on.
Jeep says the design of the Wagoneer S has been ""driven by aerodynamic efficiency."" The lone teaser photo shows a head-on shot of a more streamlined, less blocky structure than we'd normally see on a Jeep. The two blade-like side inlets on either side of the lower bumper remind us of the items found on another upcoming, US-built electric SUV, the Lucid Gravity. The company's signature seven-slot grille is LED-lit, while the rear end will likely feature a solid LED light bar, if the brief glimpses shown in the teaser video are anything to go on. In fact, the car seems to look near identical to the concept Jeep showed back in 2022:
The Wagoneer S is the first of two electric Jeep planned for 2024, with the smaller Recon also expected to enter production sometime this year. The two vehicles are the first steps in a plan to reshape Jeep's portfolio, joining the company's first electric vehicle, the Avenger, that launched in Europe in 2022.

This Ford F-150 Lightning One-Off Is Basically An Electric Raptor,https://www.motor1.com/news/704889/ford-f150-lightning-switchgear/,"It's called the Lightning Switchgear, and it loves to fly.",12/25/2024 9:05,"At a glance, one might mistake this burly Ford pickup truck for an F-150 Raptor. And why not? It’s got big mud tires (37 inchers to be exact) bolted to gnarly wheels. There's more ground clearance, more stance, more flash – everything you’d expect from Ford’s popular off-roader. But that face clearly belongs to the F-150 Lightning. Technically speaking, this isn't an electric Raptor. However, Ford tells us it's heavily influenced by years of Raptor experience.
Officially, it’s the F-150 Lightning Switchgear and no, you can’t buy it (yet). This rig is the latest demonstrator from Ford, joining vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E 1400 and bonkers SuperVan to showcase electric performance in various genres. While the Switchgear is aimed at conquering all things off-road, Ford is keen to mention this truck is also designed for performance on pavement. You might say it puts the switch in Switchgear.
For now, you want to know about the F-150 Lightning that gets airborne on purpose. To make that happen, Ford teamed up with RTR Vehicles and Vaughn Gittin Jr, and though it looks merely like a Raptorized EV, Ford tells us the Switchgear is its own entity. Fox 3.0 internal-bypass shocks are installed front and rear, paired with a custom double-wishbone suspension in front and multi-link independent with a stabilizer bar at the rear. The changes give the Switchgear a considerably wider track, 80 inches front and rear, and it wears custom carbon body panels with big ol' fender flares to contain the tires.
In off-road guise, these changes give the Switchgear 13.5 inches of ground clearance in front and 11.0 inches at the back. That's aided by the aforementioned 37-inch off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, and if you peek underneath, you'll see a steel skid plate and custom rock rails. Special front and rear bumpers help with approach and departure angles, too. The upgrades add approximately 150 pounds to the standard Lightning XLT, not bad considering all those changes but we're still talking about a truck that weighs around 7,000 pounds.
Here's where things get a bit interesting. The Switchgear also has an on-road configuration using pretty much the same suspension components. The 18-inch wheels and knobby tires are replaced with 20-inchers on street-friendly rubber. The skid plate, rock rails, and high-clearance bumpers are ditched for a big carbon composite front fascia, rocker panels, and a tonneau cover. The suspension is tweaked with different springs to favor a lower ride height, specifically 7.0 inches in front, 5.0 inches at the back.
In both formats, the powertrain is the same, and by that we mean it's 100-percent stock. That's a dual-motor setup with a 131.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack from the extended-range model. Output is 580 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque.
While Ford won't build a Lightning Switchgear for the public, Ford CEO Jim Farley says demonstrator vehicles like it play a key role in public perception of the brand. Speaking to the press at Multimatic's facility in North Carolina, he evoked the memory of Ken Block, stating the need for vehicles like these ""to generate digital content and just have fun.""
That said, despite the Switchgear's dual nature, Ford debuted only the off-road version of the upgraded Lightning at the big Ford Performance 2024 kickoff in Charlotte, North Carolina. For now at least, there's no denying the company's focus is on having fun in – and above – the dirt.
""We want to own off-road,"" said Farley. ""I don't care if it's Hammers, Dakar, or Baja.""
The hammers to which he is referring is King of the Hammers, a major off-road event held in Johnson Valley, California. Ford will be there with the Lightning Switchgear later this month, but for those more interested in the on-road version, automaker representatives tell us there's more to come.

The New Ford Kuga PHEV Has More Power Than The Escape,https://www.motor1.com/news/704903/2024-ford-kuga-facelift-specs/,Europe's Escape gets a mid-cycle update with a much quicker plug-in hybrid version.,12/25/2024 9:05,"If the new-ish Ford Kuga for Europe looks familiar, there's a good reason. The equivalent American version, the Escape, received its facelift near the end of 2022. It's only now that Ford is updating the compact crossover in Europe where there are some notable changes.
For the first time, the Kuga gets the rugged Active trim with extra plastic body cladding and silver skid plates. The adventurous flavor sits 0.4 inches higher at the front axle and 0.2 in at the rear for extra ground clearance. Ford also throws in a Trail drive mode that tweaks throttle response and traction control for more grip on mud, sand, and other soft surfaces.
Inside, the Kuga Active gets a dark wood trim on the dashboard and door panels, along with exclusive upholstery on the 18-way adjustable seats. It's worth noting the Escape has had the Active trim for years in the United States where it serves as the base model. In Europe, the 2024 Kuga will also be available in Titanium and ST-Line grades, each with subtle styling tweaks over the pre-facelifted versions.
As expected, the 2024 Kuga switches to Ford's SYNC 4 infotainment system with a 13.2-inch touchscreen accompanied by a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. The center console has been simplified by eliminating most of the conventional controls after integrating their respective functions into the enlarged display.
The engine lineup doesn't include a diesel anymore after falling out of favor in Europe, but the base version has a turbocharged 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine with 148 hp sent to the front axle via a six-speed manual gearbox. You can step up to a self-charging hybrid with a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor making a combined 177 hp in the FWD version and a slightly higher 180 hp in the AWD model.
The highlight is an upgraded plug-in hybrid, also with a 2.5-liter engine. It now puts out a combined 240 hp, which is 30 hp than the Escape PHEV. It also packs an extra 18 hp than the pre-facelift Kuga PHEV and uses ""an upgraded power-split automatic transmission"" shared with the Kuga Hybrid AWD.
The Kuga PHEV now hits 62 mph in 7.3 seconds, making it nearly two seconds quicker than before. In addition, the towing capacity has jumped by over 30 percent to 4,629 pounds. Thanks to a 14.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, it offers a maximum electric range of 43 miles (69 kilometers) in the WLTP cycle.
Ford is already taking orders in some European countries for the 2024 Kuga. A report published last year by Automotive News claimed the Escape will be retired from the US at some point in 2025.

That Futuristic Electric Kia Van Could Be Your Next Uber,https://insideevs.com/news/704869/kia-uber-deal-pbv-van/,Kia and Uber are teaming up to develop electric vehicles specifically built for ride-hailing.,1/16/2024 15:02,"Someday, you may have to say goodbye to rides to the airport in humdrum Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords. Kia’s futuristic electric vans have won over their first customer: Uber.
The two companies announced last week that they’ve signed a memorandum of understanding to use Kia’s upcoming “Platform Beyond Vehicle” (PBV) vans as ride-hailing vehicles. It’s a win-win; Uber aims to use exclusively zero-emission vehicles by 2040, and Kia needs buyers for the new family of commercial models coming in 2025.
Uber and Kia make an EV deal
Uber wants to transition its entire fleet to electric vehicles by 2040. A new line of Kia vans could help make that happen.
Kia announced the line of toaster-shaped PBV models at CES last week. The idea is to offer several different vehicle types—robotaxis, delivery vans, pickup trucks (potentially)—that all use a shared platform and driver compartment, simplifying manufacturing. The medium-sized PV5 will be Kia’s first offering, followed by larger and smaller variants.
Together, Kia and Uber will “identify optimal specifications for PBV models” and develop “PBVs tailored to the needs of drivers that use the Uber platform,” the companies said. The announcement was light on specifics about what that ride-hailing vehicle could look like but did mention “interactive rear seat entertainment systems” as a potential feature.
The PV5 concept that Kia trotted out at CES showcased another feature that could prove useful for Uber drivers and riders: a TV-sized screen embedded in its front bumper. Flashing a rider’s name or a specific code could take the guesswork out of hopping into the right car.
More Kia/Hyundai News
One potential hurdle here: Uber doesn’t provide vehicles for its drivers, who are independent contractors. That complicates its whole plan to clean up its fleet, which it's doing as regulations restricting the sale and use of gas-powered vehicles intensify around the globe. The companies say they’re working on ways to reduce the up-front cost of buying a PV5 and are exploring solutions like a battery subscription option. (An EV's battery is typically its most expensive single component.)
Down the line, Kia plans to introduce a sensor-covered PV5 that would serve as a robotaxi for Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group (Kia’s parent company) and Aptiv (an automotive supplier).

The Nissan Ariya Nismo Is A 430 Horsepower Japan-Only Sports Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/704448/ariya-nismo-japan-salon/,Nissan has injected the ho-hum Ariya with go-fast goodies and handling upgrades.,1/12/2024 15:32,"It’s Toyko Auto Salon time. Akin to the U.S.’s SEMA show, the Tokyo Auto Salon acts as a great space for aftermarket and traditional OEMs to show off their hotted-up projects that are more racy than the standard fare. This year, Nissan has shown off a spicy Ariya—and it looks like it goes way beyond the standard fare of only visual enhancements.
The Nissan Ariya Nismo Has 430 Horsepower
The Nissan Ariya Nismo is the most powerful Ariya on tap and includes a bevy of performance upgrades to make it sharper to drive. It won't be sold outside of Japan, though.
To create the Ariya Nismo, Nissan started with a standard dual-motor AWD Ariya e-4ORCE, then threw a gaggle of visual and mechanical enhancements to make the car more engaging. The 20-inch aluminum wheels are “highly rigid”, and wrapped in special tires specific to this car. Nissan says that coupled with the unspecified chassis enhancements, turn-in on the Ariya NISMO is greatly improved. The Ariya Nismo's aggressive styling is also useful, too – the ground effects kit and rear spoiler contribute to reduced drag, but more downforce at higher speeds, something Nissan says also improves the Ariya’s cornering performance.
The Ariya Nismo’s credentials go beyond racy styling or handling upgrades. Nissan also reworked the car’s EV powertrain so it now its peak output is 10% higher. For Japan, the Ariya Nismo will come in two NISMO B6 e-4ORCE, and the NISMO B9 e-4ORCE. The B6 model comes with the smaller 66 kWh battery good 362 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. The B9 model gets the larger 91 kWh battery, and its two motors produce 430 hp and 443 pound-feet of torque. No official performance numbers have been released, but we’d expect the B9 to out-accelerate the roughly 5-second 0-60 time of the standard top-of-the-line Ariya. At the very least, it should be more entertaining to drive, Nissan has added a special NISMO mode that sharpens throttle response, while providing a formula-E-inspired engine soundtrack to make the car feel even more dynamic.
These all sound like great changes to make a not-very-interesting crossover, exciting. There’s one big problem though: Nissan has no plans to market it outside of Japan. Our sister site Motor 1 received a statement from Nissan: “This is a very exciting time in Nissan’s electrification journey in our region and we are constantly looking ahead to ensure we bring our customers the best products and experiences. For the time being, the car will only be available in the Japanese market. We have no further announcements at this stage regarding introduction of this car to other markets.”
That’s truly a bummer. The Ariya is an okay EV, but when it comes to driving excitement, it definitely does not deliver anything at all. That’s upsetting, considering that this Ariya could have the chops to go against legitimately sporty EV crossovers – last year a lowered Ariya prototype was spied driving around the Nürburgring. If that Nürburgring energy was successfully imparted to the Ariya NISMO, it could be a credible threat to EVs like the Tesla Model Y Performance, Ford Mustang Mach-E GT, Kia EV6 GT, or the forthcoming Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Truly a shame that Nissan won’t sell it outside of Japan.

The 2025 Dodge Charger Looks Just Like The Excellent Concept,https://insideevs.com/news/704431/2025-dodge-charger-pre-pro/,The electric future of Dodge muscle cars is shaping up quite nicely in these pre-production photos.,1/12/2024 10:45,"Here's a nice Friday surprise for any muscle car fans out there wondering if an electric future has anything in for them: the first pre-production photos of the car that's expected to be called the 2025 Dodge Charger have emerged. And it looks extremely close to the excellent Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Concept that's been making the rounds for a while.
These photos appeared on Dodge's Facebook page earlier this morning, and the downside is they come with no actual news, unfortunately. No further details about powertrain, price, performance or anything else we need to know as this Mopar icon makes the jump to electric power. But hey, we do know it's going to look awesome, and that's certainly something.
All we get from these photos of a car on a lot (presumably in Michigan) as camo tape is stripped away from it is a caption that says, ""No cameras or recording devices permitted. Pre-production model shown. Available late 2024."" The rest is up to your imagination, but since this is indeed a pre-production model—used for all sorts of things including testing—it does tell us that the design language of that concept car has translated to the real thing.
Unveiled in fall 2022, the Charger Daytona SRT Concept previewed an all-electric future for American muscle. That topic is as controversial as you get for enthusiasts who may not exactly be eager to part ways with internal combustion. But the specs may win them over: an 800-volt architecture, all-wheel-drive, speeds projected to surpass the SRT Hellcat and factory performance upgrades. It's believed the car will come with a variety of power outputs ranging from 455 horsepower to 800 hp or more.
The next Charger (which is a coupe, unlike the outgoing Charger sedan) is equally controversial for what's called the Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust system: an artificial sound that simulates the rumble and pitch of a V8 engine and is said to be as loud as a Hellcat as well. When that feature was previewed in 2022, it debuted to mixed reactions, to say the least. But the Mopar folks have indicated they've been working on it since, so the final product might be much more of a crowd-pleaser.
Interestingly, Dodge initially indicated the Charger would be EV-only, but now it's expected to pack a gas engine as well—possibly the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter ""Hurricane"" inline-six currently available in Ram and Jeep vehicles. It's unclear which one we're looking at in these new pics, but given the importance of this EV to the future of muscle cars, it possible Dodge will want to lead with that version. (And is that a gas cap or a charging port here?)
Either way, I think it looks sharp. We'll see if it has what it takes to win over the V8 die-hards when it makes its official debut later this year.

Hyundai Makes The Ioniq 5 N Meaner With N Performance Parts,https://www.motor1.com/news/704336/hyundai-lexus-2024-tokyo-auto-salon/,"Plus, Lexus does the same with a special-edition RZ that has two rear wings.",12/25/2024 9:05,"Hyundai and Lexus have given their electric SUVs more aggressive body kits for this week's 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon in Japan.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Hyundai NPX1 Concept
Forget about BMW's M Performance Parts; Hyundai would like to introduce you to its N Performance Parts. These additional enhancements are showcased on an Ioniq 5 N, dubbed the NPX1, at the Tokyo Auto Salon. While extra bits have been available for N gasoline models for a while, this marks the first time an electric N is getting them.
Although the NPX1 is technically a concept, Hyundai plans to start selling the parts for the Ioniq 5 N later this year. The showcar from TAS looks mean with its comprehensive body kit, featuring a carbon front splitter and a massive rear wing. It also has beefier side skirts and an enlarged diffuser, while the wheels are built from a combination of alloy and carbon to reduce weight
Suspension lowering springs and upgraded brake pads round off the changes on the outside. Although images of the interior have yet to be revealed, Hyundai mentions that the NPX1 sports bucket seats and makes generous use of Alcantara.
Going forward, the South Korean automaker intends to develop N Performance Parts for all its N cars.
Lexus RZ 450e F Sport Performance
Lexus has a similar idea for its electric SUV, as the RZ has also received a collection of performance parts. Unlike the NPX1 concept, this is going into production as is. The special edition is limited to 100 units, based on the RZ450e. Just like the Subaru WRX S4 STI Sport showcased at TAS, it will be sold through a lottery system. Japanese customers can enter from now until February 19, with the lucky winners set to be announced on February 22.
The first dedicated electric vehicle from Lexus has gained an aggressive body kit with not one but two rear wings. It incorporates a total of 17 aerodynamic body parts and a sportier suspension kit complemented by 21-inch wheels. The RZ450e F Sport Performance is slightly longer, wider, and taller than the standard model. The flashy SUV is painted in matte white and features a predominantly black cabin with blue accents and suede upholstery.
You're not getting any extra power since it has the same dual-motor setup with a front-mounted motor making 201 hp and 195 lb-ft (265 Nm) along with a rear motor rated at 107 hp and 130 lb-ft (170 Nm).
Taking after the 2023 RZ Sport Concept, the special edition costs 11,800,000 yen ($81,300).

"Biden Announces $623 Million In Funding For 7,500 Charging Plugs",https://insideevs.com/news/704272/biden-charging-plugs-funding/,More charging plugs are badly needed for Biden's plan to accelerate adoption of electric vehicles.,1/11/2024 15:55,"Even with a big infusion of federal money in recent years, charging your electric car in public still isn't the easiest thing to do. The Biden Administration has taken some heat for this situation as of late, but today, it announced some welcome news for EV drivers everywhere: an additional $623 million in grants aimed at putting 7,500 more EV charging ports in the ground across 22 states and Puerto Rico.
The funding comes by way of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program, which arms the Federal Highway Administration with $2.5 billion to spend on alternative fueling stations, including EV chargers, in local communities and along highways. The grants announced on Thursday were the first awarded through the initiative.
Biden's big EV charging plan
President Biden has made it a central mission to combat climate change and get more Americans buying electric cars. Congress has allotted $7.5 billion to build out the country's charging infrastructure.
“This funding will help ensure that EV chargers are accessible, reliable, and convenient for American drivers, while creating jobs in charger manufacturing, installation, and maintenance for American workers,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.
The FHA will dole out $311 million to 36 so-called “community” projects building EV charging and hydrogen fueling stations at schools, libraries, public parks and the like. The other $312 million will go toward “corridor” projects along major highways.
President Joe Biden has made transitioning U.S. drivers away from gas-guzzlers one of his central policy missions, touting a goal to make half of the country’s car sales electric by 2030. More charging infrastructure—along with more robust and reliable stations—is badly needed to make that happen.
Importantly, the CFI program invests in slower Level 2 charging plugs in local communities, complementing the national network of Level 3 fast chargers that the White House is funding along interstate highways. (While it tends to be less of a priority than fast charging, there remains a strong need for overnight public charging as well.)
More Charging Stories
The U.S. government’s $7.5 billion program to blanket the country with 500,000 extra charging stations is only just starting to bear fruit. The first Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded charging location came online in December, just over two years after Congress approved the funding. That progress comes on the brink of a presidential election and during a time when electric cars are more politicized than ever.
Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates—including former President Donald Trump—have ramped up their attacks on EVs, bashing them as impractical, expensive cars that Democrats are forcing on the American public. The more progress the White House can make on charging in 2024, the better things will be—both for EV buyers and for Biden's reelection chances.

The Tesla Model 3 'Highland' Facelift Is Finally Coming To North America,https://insideevs.com/news/703915/tesla-model-3-facelift-us-debut/,Deliveries in the United States are estimated to begin this month.,1/10/2024 2:40,"The refreshed Tesla Model 3, also known as Highland after its internal development code, can now be ordered in North America, five months after it debuted in Europe and other parts of the world.
As with its European counterpart, the American-bound Model 3 is available with only two powertrain options: the base Rear-Wheel Drive, which starts at $38,990 and offers an EPA-estimated driving range of 272 miles, and the Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Long Range, which has an MSRP of $45,990 and ups the range figure to 341 miles.
The updated Tesla Model 3 makes its way to the U.S.
Five months after its European launch, the refreshed Tesla Model 3 is now available in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The pricing is the same as before, but there’s no Performance trim and the car is not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit in the U.S.
There’s no Performance trim yet in the online configurator, but a Sport or Ludicrous version might come at a later date, as discovered in the official Tesla parts catalog and the software code for the car itself.
Compared to the pre-facelift version, the new Model 3 offers the same number of driving miles on a full charge, while the Long Range version comes with 8 more miles of advertised range. The prices are the same as for the outgoing model.
Leasing is also available starting at the same price of $329/month as before, but there’s no word on whether the facelifted Model 3 is eligible for the $7,500 tax credit when buying outright. Before the updated model became available Stateside, the Model 3 Performance was the only version eligible for the tax credit.
More Model 3 Stories
Tesla is now taking orders for the refreshed EV through its website, with deliveries estimated to begin in January-February.
Few if any surprises are in store for U.S. buyers, as the car was revealed back in August of last year. The updated Model 3 comes with a redesigned face that no longer features standalone fog lights and indicators, as they have been integrated into the main headlight units). It also has new rear lights that are now single-piece rather than the split type that was fitted to the old version.
Inside, there are LED ambient light strips and a newly added 8-inch rear display with controls for climate, ventilation, and infotainment, while the front 15.4-inch display is the same size as before but has slimmer bezels.
The column-mounted stalks are gone, with buttons on the steering wheel taking over the functions of the levers. Furthermore, comfort was increased thanks to the use of acoustic glass for the entire glasshouse and more sound-deadening material, and the ride is a bit better than before thanks to a revised front suspension geometry. Ventilated front seats are also offered as standard.
The facelifted Tesla Model 3 is also available in Canada and Mexico with the same features and estimated delivery window.",Iulian Dnistran
"Honda's First Next-Generation EV Will Look ""Very Close"" To Concept, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/703890/honda-saloon-concept-ev-very-close/,Honda revealed two futuristic concept cars on Tuesday that preview its next-generation global EV lineup.,1/9/2024 18:35,"When car companies show off outlandish concept cars, it’s often tough to distinguish fact from fiction—to parse out what’s purely a design exercise versus what’s actually headed to production.
Those questions were top of mind as Honda pulled the wraps off of two futuristic electric concepts on Tuesday at CES in Las Vegas. At a press conference, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe cleared up some of the confusion.
“A production model, based very close on this concept, will come first to the US and then around the world in 2026,” he said, referring to a long, sleek concept called the Saloon.
It’s likely that many of the Saloon’s quirkiest attributes—like a dazzling screen in place of a grille and enormous gull-wing doors—won’t make it to American roads. But Mibe’s comments suggest that the overall design and look of the Saloon, which is unlike any vehicle on the road, will in fact be carried through to production.
Visually, the Saloon is simple and striking. It's comprised of a single form, rather than the traditional three-box design (hood, greenhouse, trunk) that sedans traditionally follow. It evokes wedge-shaped cars of the 1970s and 1980s—like the Lamborghini Countach—more than anything from the 21st century. Its low roofline and slippery silhouette will help reduce drag and increase range, a primary concern for EVs, Honda said. It also features a new Honda logo.

Honda also unveiled a concept van called the Space Hub, but it hasn't indicated that a production vehicle like it will hit the market.
The Saloon-inspired car will launch Honda’s new family of electric vehicles, dubbed Honda 0. They debut new tech from Honda that will allow for faster charging and better efficiency than today’s EVs. Specifics on the new line of vehicles are scant. We hope to learn more as 2026 approaches.

Honda EVs Will Sport A Brand New Logo,https://insideevs.com/news/703866/honda-new-logo-ces/,Next-gen electric versions of Honda's passenger cars are getting a new logo for the first time in 22 years.,1/9/2024 14:04,"Next-gen electric versions of Honda's passenger cars are getting a new logo for the first time in 22 years.
At CES today, Honda announced two new EV concepts, the Saloon and Space-Hub, as well as a new global EV platform called ""Honda 0."" Only the Salon is going into production—well, kind of, anyway. The Saloon will serve as the basis for Honda's EVs coming in 2026. That's not to say that the radical design cues will come to a driveway near you (although the Cybertruck is real, so here's hoping), but maybe its spacious interior, high-tech steer-by-wire, and other small tidbits.
Honda's electrification strategy is the company's biggest transformation in decades.
Honda's new ""H mark"" logo represents not just the brand's drastic change by electrifying its fleet, but also its shift from the typical ""thick, heavy, but smart"" mentality for EVs to one that makes its cars ""thin, light, and wise.""
One design that we know will be coming is a new Honda ""H mark"" logo that sits square in the center of its grille.
Honda says that its new ""H mark"" logo will be used exclusively for its next generation EVs. The idea is to visually demonstrate that Honda is taking on a a historic transformation as the world pivots to EVs. The logo is said to represent ""two outstretched hands,"" which Honda says represents its commitment to expand the possibilities of mobility.
Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda, says that the automaker plans on doing things a bit differently. Rather than build land yachts, Honda is committing to building lean and efficient battery-powered driving machines. And that alone is a huge deal. Here's what CEO Mibe has to say about the brand's path forward:
The mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of ""thick, heavy, but smart"" EVs. We will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.
Now that we've got the marketing talk out of the way, let's get into the meat of this. This is a pretty big branding change for Honda. It has held the current H mark for more than two decades now, and it's had some sort of surround to its older vehicle emblems for the better part of a half-century. This departure certainly is different, and—let's be real—is probably better than Kia's recent rebranding that has people asking ""what is the KN car brand?""
Obviously, Honda's going to need more than a logo change to prove it's a serious player in the EV space. It only sells a few electric models globally and will depend on General Motors' Ultium platform for its first modern EV efforts in North America, the upcoming Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX. Things may be changing quickly, however. Honda is now planning a major battery hub in Ohio and may also be doing a huge EV factory in Canada. Perhaps this logo change signals a shift many fans have been waiting for.
Tell us: what do you think of Honda's new design shift?

"The Tiny, Ultra Cheap VinFast VF3 EV Is Coming To The U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/703867/ultra-cheap-vinfast-vf3-confirmed-us/,The Vietnamese automaker also showcased a mid-size pickup concept that will supposedly become a series production model.,1/9/2024 14:00,"The pint-sized VinFast VF3 all-electric urban runabout is officially coming to the United States, a company spokesperson confirmed for InsideEVs during the model’s global launch at CES 2024 in Las Vegas earlier today. The Wild mid-size pickup concept, which previews a series production model, was also revealed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show.
It’s good news for anybody who’s looking for a no-frills, affordable all-electric vehicle that offers the bare necessities and just enough space inside for four people. That said, we still don’t know when exactly the diminutive EV will reach American shores or how much it will cost when it eventually arrives in dealerships here, but an adviser to the automaker went on record last year saying that “it’s probably sub-$20,000.”
VinFast confirms tiny two-door EV will come to the U.S.
VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker that's trying to make a name for itself in the American car market, confirmed that its smallest and most affordable model, the VF3, will come to the United States.
If it turns out to be true, it would be the cheapest new EV on sale in the country that’s not a Neighbourhood Electric Vehicle (NEV), meaning that getting a battery-powered car would be easier for many more people who can’t afford anything more expensive.
More VinFast Stories
Measuring just 125.6 inches long, 66.1 in wide, and 63.8 in tall, the VF3 is about 30 inches shorter, 3 inches narrower, and 1 inch taller than the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Details are still scarce, but VinFast said it’s aiming for an EPA driving range of 125 miles on a full charge.
Is that enough for American streets? We’ll have to wait and see when the car becomes a real occurrence on U.S. roads and not just a placeholder. In the meantime, you can scroll down to the comments section to let us know what you think.
There’s a 10-inch screen for the infotainment system, as well as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, although the company didn’t mention if they’re of the wired or wireless variety.
The two rear seats fold flat to create a total cargo capacity of 550 liters or 19.42 cubic feet, which is on par with a compact four-door hatchback. It’s worth noting, however, that VinFast didn’t say what the cargo capacity of the VF3 is with all four seats in place, but we’d argue it’s tiny.
Then, there are the unavoidable potential issues of reliability and build quality. One of the marque’s bigger EVs, the VF8, which is already being sold in the U.S., was slammed by several reviewers when it was launched Stateside. The InsideEVs review of the 2023 VinFast VF8 City Edition summed everything up into one word in the headline: “Yikes.”
The Vietnamese startup will begin accepting reservations for the VF3 sometime this year. In its home market of Vietnam, deliveries of the pint-sized EV are scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year, and we expect the U.S. to follow.
Stepping into the fantasy world for a moment (even if we were just barely outside of it), VinFast also revealed a concept vehicle that portrays an all-electric pickup truck. Dubbed the Wild, the EV is 209 in long and 79 in wide and features a power-folding mid-gate that allows the bed length to expand from 5 to 8 feet with the rear seats folded down automatically.
There’s also a panoramic glass roof and a pair of digital side mirrors that supposedly improve aerodynamics, but probably the most important piece of information is that the Wild pickup previews a series-production electric pickup that may or may not come to the United States.
If it does make its way to the U.S., it would go against other pickups like the Tesla Cybertruck, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Rivian R1T, but it’s worth mentioning that all of these are real vehicles you can buy and that all three are longer than VinFast’s concept (the R1T is classed as mid-size while the Lightning and Cybertruck are full-size).
They also benefit from established and growing service networks, as opposed to VinFast, which is still in its infancy on all fronts.",Iulian Dnistran
Honda Previews New Line Of EVs With Two Futuristic Concept Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/703699/honda-concept-evs-new-platform/,"A production vehicle based on the sleek Saloon concept should hit the North American market in 2026, Honda says.",1/9/2024 14:00,"Lacking a single electric model on sale in the U.S., Honda hasn’t embraced electrification quite as enthusiastically as some rivals. But that’s changing.
On Tuesday at CES in Las Vegas, the Japanese automaker took the wraps off of two futuristic concept cars that preview a new lineup of EVs dubbed Honda 0. Honda has bold plans to launch 30 new electric models globally by 2030 and transition to exclusively zero-emission sales in the US by 2040. Tuesday’s announcement gives us a better sense of what that transformation will look like in practice. So let’s dive in.
The more significant concept car here is the Saloon, which will serve as the basis of the first Honda 0 production car come 2026. It will launch in 2026 in North America before hitting other markets. Honda says the long, sleek concept sits on a dedicated EV platform and has a “surprisingly spacious” interior made from sustainable materials. With a silhouette vaguely reminiscent of wedge-era cars like the Delorean DMC-12, it would be an EV that looks unlike anything else on the road today.
It’s likely that the production car's design will be significantly more restrained. (But here’s hoping that come 2026 you’ll be able to buy a Honda that looks just like this.)
Other features found in the Saloon that could make it into a future production vehicle: an airplane-style steering yoke and a steer-by-wire system. The latter means the steering wheel tells the wheels to turn electronically, not mechanically like usual. That type of setup could allow for some interesting capabilities. Turning the steering yoke the same amount could result in different turning behavior in a tight parking lot versus on the highway, for example.
Details are much more scant on the Space Hub concept, a rounded, van-looking thing with a big interior and two rows of seating that face one another. There’s no word yet on whether it’ll inspire a production vehicle, but you can bet that Honda will introduce an SUV to the Honda 0 portfolio sooner rather than later. That’s just what Americans crave.
Both concepts showcase a new design and engineering approach Honda’s using for the Honda 0 lineup.
Until then, the company’s first EVs for the US—the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX SUVs, hitting roads this year—will borrow their underlying technology from General Motors. (And, I’ll add, the Ultium technology underpinning GM's latest EVs has hit a few stumbling blocks during its prolonged development. Software glitches in a Chevrolet Blazer EV recently stranded our very own Kevin Williams.)
These next-generation vehicles will use EV technology that Honda is developing completely in-house. Until then, concrete details remain fairly scant. The range of these vehicles is anyone’s guess; Honda says it will be “ample.”
The company is prioritizing lightweight packaging, efficiency and new software features. Honda 0 vehicles will be powered by energy-dense batteries that can recharge from 15% to 80% in 10-15 minutes, faster than most vehicles today, the company said. Those batteries will degrade by less than 10% over 10 years.
The vehicles will come equipped with a Honda-developed operating system that uses AI to learn a driver’s needs and preferences over time. And they’ll offer a next-generation automated-driving system that will allow for hands-free driving on surface streets, according to Honda. Oh, and in another sign that Honda means business here, it's introducing a new ""H"" logo to slap on these bad boys.
We’ll have to wait and see how this all pans out come 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, we’re on site at CES and hope to hear more. Feel free to drop any burning questions for Honda executives, designers and engineers down below.

"AI Assistants, In-Car Gaming And Tons Of Range: Coming To Your Next Mercedes-Benz",https://insideevs.com/news/703668/mercedes-official-ces-2024/,"Mercedes has some bold, experimental ideas for how your driving experience could feel in the next few years. Will customers bite?",1/8/2024 21:00,"The fight for automotive supremacy in the future won't come down to horsepower or mechanical specs. It will probably come down to software; at least, that's what the car companies tell us. That idea may seem radical to anyone driving a car from the last decade who's just happy that their Apple CarPlay or Android Auto setup works so well, but all of the automakers have much bigger, grander plans for what we experience inside their cars than we currently do.
Case in point: Mercedes-Benz's big announcements at CES 2024 aren't about performance or even electric range this time, but the future software-driven features coming to its cars very soon.
The giant Las Vegas tech show served as a preview for a bevy of Mercedes technologies coming to both its EVs and internal combustion-powered cars starting next year, including its smartest voice-controlled virtual assistant ever thanks to AI; more expansions into in-car gaming; a taste of its new all-encompassing suite, MB.OS; the North American debut of its future electric sedan and Tesla Model 3 competitor; and a unique system co-developed with musician will.i.am that ""allows music to react to how the car is being driven,"" in Mercedes' words. (More on that in its own story right here.) Let's dive in.
In-car software and AI is the big story at CES this year
After years of EV and concept car debuts, automakers like Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW are focused on upping their software game at the tech mega-show in 2024. All car companies have huge plans for revenue through software features, including via subscriptions.
If you've been fortunate enough to experience Mercedes' MBUX software system across all three parts of the Hyperscreen on certain EQ electric cars, you know how powerful and graphically impressive it is. (At least, that's my take.) Equally impressive are the voice controls, where you can say ""Hey, Mercedes"" and get a swift response to most things you need without having to fish through the Hyperscreen's menus when you're on the road.
To that, Mercedes says: ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" The MB.OS system coming soon to the company's all-new MMA platform is a purpose-built chip-to-cloud operating system that brings a number of diverse functions under one roof: in-car content, charging, maps, car setting controls and automated driving.
A big part of that will be the MBUX Virtual Assistant, which Mercedes calls "" the most human-like interface with a Mercedes-Benz yet."" Powered by ChatGPT—something Volkswagen announced today at CES as well—Mercedes' Chief Technology Officer Markus Schäfer said the system can do more than just follow your voice commands. It can have a ""dialogue"" with users, and even pick up on the moods they're in to respond with ""empathy.""
The AI has four different personality traits—Natural, Predictive, Personal and Empathetic—that can be adjusted to your personal tastes or situation behind the wheel. The AI Projects as a glowing three-pointed star logo with various color changes and animations to illustrate its state of being. It could glow a certain way when providing a warning, for example, and a different way when it's listening to you.
""In some cases, hopefully, the assistant predicts already what you want, depending on your moods, the daytime, the location you are in and the circumstances you are in,"" Schäfer said. But after an easy conversation, Schäfer said the assistant ""can address whatever you want from your car, whether you want entertainment, you want information and so on.""
The assistant has four different ""emotions"" and can respond to your requests based on your own mood at the time. ""You can have a constant interaction with your car,"" Schäfer told InsideEVs at a press roundtable earlier today.
In other words, this system should do a lot more than just tell you where the nearest charging station is when you say ""Hey, Mercedes."" It may also commiserate with you about how annoyed you are to be stuck in traffic.
These days, it's not uncommon for high-tech EVs to have displays with visualizations of the cars and objects in the surrounding area; Tesla's center screen is arguably the best example of this. But Mercedes is taking this to a different level.
Using the Unity game engine, the next-gen cars will offer MBUX Surround Navigation: a 3D visualization that allows you to ""see what the car sees,"" as Mercedes puts it. Though your eyes are good at what they do, this system gives more of a bird's-eye view of other cars, trucks, cyclists or even pedestrians—superimposing potential hazards onto the route guidance to help you navigate a tough urban environment beyond just what you yourself can see.
""So for example, navigating through downtown traffic, finding a parking spot, knowing where you're going to make your turn""—all are projected via Surround Navigation, Mercedes' Chief Software Officer Magnus Östberg said during the press conference. The 3D game engine projects ""all the sensor data that we're taking from the cameras, the radar, the LIDAR, that really gives the driver situational awareness. It's not only beautiful graphics but also a safe experience,"" he said.
Though we weren't offered the chance to experience this for ourselves at CES, it does seem like an impressive evolution of the navigation experience—and a good visualization of much of the data the car normally keeps to itself.
Mercedes also knows you need something to do while you're charging, and at least one answer to that is the video games I had when I was a kid. Bubble Bobble is back, kids. Get excited.
Mercedes announced a wide array of partnerships bringing new music, movies, video games and other content to those giant screens soon. Those include Audible and Amazon Music for podcasts and audiobooks, as well as Antstream Arcade for retro cloud-based gaming. It's not far off what you can already do with your smartphone, but the native access to these services should provide a nice experience on some much bigger, more high-res screens when you have downtime in the car.
Though some early iterations of these features are available on the new 2024 Mercedes E-Class, which runs a ""precursor"" to MB.OS, the real show starts when the car above hits the road next year. That's the Concept CLA Class, which first debuted at IAA Munich in 2023 and is making its first-ever appearance in North America for CES.
The final production version of the next CLA isn't expected to veer too far from the concept here, and when it does, it will not only be a Model 3 fighter—something badly needed in an SUV-focused world—but it will debut MB.OS for the first time. That car will also be the first of at least four EVs on the new MMA platform, which, together with MB.OS, represents a much more cohesive transformation of Mercedes than we've seen before. By putting all these technologies together with one software platform, the automaker says it can offer a level of features and personalization it's never been able to before.
And the next CLA is expected to be a mighty EV, not just a computer on wheels. With an 800-volt architecture, an estimated 466 miles of range on Europe's WLTP cycle and the ability to add an estimated 248 miles of range in 15 minutes, this should be a winner if it even come close to those claims. Furthermore, with an estimated 5.2 miles per kilowatt-hour, it should be one of the most efficient EVs on the road.
We'll see this and more from Mercedes as CES goes on this week.

Kia’s 'Platform Beyond Vehicle' Is A Line Of Transforming Commercial EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/703518/kia-platform-beyond-vehicle/,"With extensive modularity, advanced software control and even a robotaxi eventually, Kia has wild plans for the utility vehicle space.",1/8/2024 18:00,"Car companies love to talk about “mobility solutions” and “last-mile delivery systems,” but with a few notable exceptions, the commercial vehicle space feels like a pretty stagnant one. Even if they happen to be electric, most efforts in that arena are just delivery vans or maybe pickup truck. Where’s the innovation? Well, Kia—the Korean automaker that’s rapidly becoming a major power player in the EV space—unveiled some future commercial vehicle plans at CES today, and they do seem to be on a different level.
Meet the Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV for short. It’s not just one car, but an entire platform of transforming, modular electric vehicles designed to underpin a family of future work-focused vehicles. The cars unveiled at CES are the PV1 small van, PV7 large van, and the midsize PV5, which actually comes in several variants that will also ultimately include an autonomous robotaxi.
Kia's got big, global plans
Though it used to be an ultra-budget brand, Kia is one of the fastest-growing automakers now in multiple countries and segments. Along with its corporate sibling Hyundai, it's got big plans for more EVs and EV factories globally—and now the commercial and delivery world, too.
In a news release, Kia's president and CEO Ho Sung Song said the PBV line ""represents our vision of going beyond the traditional concept of automobiles by fulfilling the unmet needs of diverse customers and communities through optimized vehicles and services catering to specific market and business circumstances.""
In other words, what you're seeing here is something different from the average electric crossover that seems to debut every week as of late. Moreover, this appears to be an entirely new line of business for Kia beyond just selling cars. These vehicles are ""intended to be a total mobility solution that combines fit-for-purpose EVs with advanced software solutions based on the Hyundai Motor Group’s software-to-everything, or SDx, strategy,"" the automaker said in a news release—meaning that fleet management via software will be a big part of what's to come here.
A few key details have not been released yet, however, including the cost of these vehicles, what battery packs they'll use and their estimated ranges. But this news offers a fascinating preview into what Kia has in store next.
We'll start with the PV5 family, which for now is just being called the Concept PV5 even though it looks fairly production-ready. You still get Kia's futuristic design language here, although it's pared down a bit for commercial use and kind of stands on its own. Four variants of PV5 debuted at CES—Basic, Van, High Roof, and Chassis Cab—each with large, pillarless door openings and a great deal of interior room.
Here's where things get really interesting. Kia says that the body parts behind the driver are modular and transformable, such that a single chassis can be used in multiple forms if the owner desires. Behind the cab, or ""driver zone,"" sit the ""life modules""—basically, the different van bodies. Those ""can be connected to the base vehicle via a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology, turning the PBV into a taxi during the day, to a delivery van at night, and a personal recreational vehicle on weekends,"" Kia said.
The idea of a modular car has been around for many decades—the old Nissan Pulsar Sportbak delivered on this back in the 1980s—but it's an idea that's generally stayed in the concept realm. Presumably, using a battery pack and electric motors in the floor might allow this idea to become more of a reality, since that setup eliminates a lot of the drivetrain challenges you'd encounter with a modular internal combustion car.
Kia adds that the body structure of these vans is weldless, too, enabling moveable members to adjust to the different vehicle sizes at work here. We're eager to learn more about how Kia's doing that and the manufacturing techniques involved. "" Shipped in standardized, convenient kit form, Dynamic Hybrid technology is intended to allow for the quick and simple in-field transformation of a Kia PV5,"" the automaker said.
More importantly, the PV5 is how Kia plans to introduce a dedicated robotaxi down the line. That van body style makes a lot more sense for such duty than, say, a Jaguar I-Pace. Kia added few details about that model, except to say that it aims for Level 4 autonomy—a high degree of full automated driving.
It's crucial to note that the robotaxi industry has had a rough go the past few years. Last year saw a number of crushing setbacks for General Motors subsidiary Cruise, and a year before that, the whole business was stunned at the closure of Argo AI. But even if that industry is contracting, many automakers and tech companies alike seem dead-set on the business potential of eventual full autonomy.
Kia added that it's working with companies like Boston Dynamics, Uber, the Dubai Taxi Corporation and its own Motional joint venture for a ""PBV-dedicated business system"" around these robotaxis.
Next, we have the two vans that that make up the smallest and biggest ends of the lineup. The PV7 is expected to be a large van with ""impressive range"" for long-distance hauling, while the PV1 is meant for short-distance transportation and has a turning radius designed for tight spaces.
There are several other key announcements here too. There's a huge software focus with the PBV line that includes fleet management, over-the-air updates, AI technologies for custom business solutions and more. ""Features may include inventory monitoring, temperature control, and intelligent route planning for efficiency. The solution is intended to streamline fleet management with real-time data and AI integration for predictive maintenance and optimal operational efficiency,"" the automaker said.
Moreover, Kia is building a dedicated plant in Korea for the PBV family of vehicles—complete with customization for different commercial clients—that is expected to go online in 2025 and will have an annual capacity of 150,000 units.
All in all, this announcement represents a big expansion of what Kia does, how it does it and who it serves; it almost sounds like the Korean company's cross between Google's Waymo and Rivian's commercial van business, on perhaps an even larger scale. And it's another example of how car companies find themselves facing a future where they need to do more than just sell cars to survive.
More on all of this as we sit down with Kia's executives at CES this week.

Volkswagen Says An Electric GTI Is Coming In 2026,https://www.motor1.com/news/701860/vw-design-boss-electric-gti-2026/,"Plus, Abarth launches a hot hatch with a retractable folding roof and Lexus-like vertically stacked exhaust tips.",12/25/2024 9:05,"An electric GTI is coming in two years' time, and Abarth launches an interesting version of the 595 pocket rocket.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Electric Volkswagen GTI Coming In 2026
While we're patiently waiting for the GTI to get a mid-cycle facelift in 2024, Volkswagen is already thinking ahead. The company's design boss took to Instagram to announce a fully electric version is coming in 2026. Andreas Mindt shared a sketch of the original Golf GTI alongside the recently unveiled ID. GTI concept.
Since the Mk1 came out in 1975, VW has managed to sell more than 2.8 million units of the Grand Tourer Injection out of a total of more than 35 million Golfs sold throughout eight generations. The first one without a combustion engine is arriving in roughly two years' time. It should peacefully coexist with the gasoline hot hatch for several years.
The sketch seemingly suggests that VW will use the ""Golf"" moniker for a production version of the ID. GTI. However, lest we forget the concept was based on another showcar, the ID. 2all. That was a smaller vehicle seen as future electric replacement of the Polo supermini. The peeps from Wolfsburg said it would be ""as spacious as a Golf, as affordable as a Polo."" Both concepts were underpinned by the forthcoming MEB Entry platform for front-wheel-drive vehicles. The ninth-generation, electric-only Golf due in 2028 will ride on the upcoming SSP platform.
Time will tell whether the electric GTI due in 2026 will be a Golf GTI or an ID.2 GTI since it's all a bit confusing right now. We wager it'll be the latter. In the meantime, VW has trademarked a new ""GTI"" logo where the ""I"" is replaced by a lightning bolt.
The Abarth F595C Has A Lexus-Like Exhaust
Abarth introduced the 500e electric hot hatch about a year ago but it’s still selling the gasoline versions in some parts of the world. Japan happens to be one of the markets where Fiat’s performance division is keeping the ICE alive. Not only that, but the feisty city car is getting the special edition treatment based on the convertible with its electrically folding fabric roof.
Available in both left- and right-hand-drive configurations, the Abarth F595C is capped at 160 units. Production is evenly split between LHD and RHD, both of which come with a five-speed manual gearbox. The special variant also gets a Beats audio system inherited from the beefier 695 series. Customers can pick from Grigio Record (gray) and Rosso Passione (red) colors, each capped at 80 units.
Power is provided by a turbocharged 1.4-liter gasoline engine making 162 hp and 154 lb-ft (210 Nm) of torque. That might not sound like much, but the car only weighs 2,557 pounds (1,160 kilograms). It's just about as heavy as a Mazda MX-5 Miata RF. It features vertically stacked exhaust tips that might make you think of a Lexus F model. BMW has an optional M Performance exhaust with stacked exhaust tips as well but they're mounted near the center. Mind you, this is not the first Abarth to adopt this setup since the F595 had it first back in 2021.
The Abarth F595C goes on sale today in Japan and costs 4,750,000 yen, which works out to about $33,200 at current exchange rates.

This Electric Porsche 964 RSR Misses The Point,https://www.motor1.com/news/701356/everatti-porsche-964-rsr/,"It looks cool, but those looks are passing checks the powertrain can't cash.",12/25/2024 9:06,"There's no shortage of Porsche 911 restomods these days. There's a version for every taste, whether you want something perfected by Singer, something a bit more wild by Guntherwerks, or something that revs to 11,000 by Tuthill. Then there's Everrati, the British company that's done some pretty clever work in converting 911s to full electric cars. Their latest, a tribute to the 3.8 liter 964 RS, though, is a bit of a conundrum.
Before we get into why, perhaps a bit of an explanation of what Everrati does is warranted. The company rips out the heart of the 911, the flat-six, and replaces it with two electric motors behind the rear axle. It then loads the car up with batteries, but in order to maintain weight distribution it splits the batteries between the front and rear. They're proud of being able to keep that the same to hopefully continue to give the 911 the same unique character its had since it debuted 60 years ago.
By all accounts, they are fun to drive and cost little to run, a zero-emission way to continue having a car that looks like an old 911 in a future when the combustion engine isn't dead. This particular model, though, is where things start to make less sense.
This flash of yellow is inspired by the 3.8 liter 964 RSR, one of the most raw 911s of that era, a true motorsport-inspired car with a widebody, big wing, and 325 hp that ran through a five-speed manual. Think of it like a race car for the road. They fetch big bucks now, too, with one selling in 2022 for $1.2 million.
Now, Everrati's version is likely better built than the original. It's better for the environment, too. It even gets to 60 in 3.7 seconds, about a second quicker than the original. I find it very hard to care.
The thing with a car like the RSR now is that it doesn't matter how well it's built, how good it is for the environment, or how quick it is. What matters is what it represents, a throwback to a time when cars were all about deep mechanical involvement. It's the thing that resonated with me after driving the new 911 S/T, and how every little bit of the mechanical experience connected with the driver. The RSR was an equally raw experience 30 years ago, a car that demanded your attention at all times and had an engine that spoke to every sense. Take away the engine and replace it with batteries and motors, and while the 911 S/T would probably still be great to drive, it'd no longer be the 911 S/T. It'd be a fun EV sports car.
More 911s? More 911s.
Here, we have a body kit on an old 911 and its heart ripped out, gearbox and all. The engagement that came from the drivetrain is dead, and you're left with a car that looks like the coolest 911 on the block and might even be fun to drive, but you're missing one of the most important elements of the original.
That's not to say EV conversions are bad things. On the contrary, for certain cars they make all the sense in the world. There are luxury cars from decades ago that would be better powered by electricity and some small sports cars could harness an EV powertrain in an interesting way. EV swaps have also certainly saved older cars that had blown engines and given them a second chance at life.
And while the base for this car may have given a scrap 964 a chance to live again, it's also gotten the body of a true legend, a car famous for how raw and uncompromising it is. Except its lost the component that not only gives it part of its name, but much of its character. I tend to judge owners who put badges on their cars that they don't deserve – here's looking at you guy with a 528i that says M5 on the back – and this 964 Carrera RS without an engine sure is one of them.
If you think I'm full of crap and that you want to buy one, be my guest. But if you buy an EV converted 911 with an RSR bodykit, prepare to do a lot of explaining, and be prepared to not sound cool at all while you do it.",Travis Okulski
The Toyota Crown Sport Goes Plug-In Hybrid With 302 Horsepower,https://www.motor1.com/news/701393/toyota-crown-sport-phev-details/,It can cover 56 miles without sipping any gasoline.,12/25/2024 9:06,"We only get two of the four Crown models here in the United States – the raised sedan and the upcoming Signia SUV. In Japan, there's also a traditional sedan without the lift kit, and this smaller crossover, the Crown Sport. That model is now getting a charging port and a more potent powertrain, but still won't be coming to the U.S.
Smaller than the Crown Signia, the JDM-spec Crown Sport looks like Japan's Ferrari Purosangue, especially in red paint. Sadly, it doesn't have a V12, but it's still pretty powerful by Toyota standards. With a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor, it has a combined output of 302 horsepower delivered to all four wheels.
For the PHEV variant, Toyota upped the stopping power by upgrading the front brakes with 20-inch discs hugged by six-piston calipers, finished in red at both axles. It also went through the trouble of fitting paddle shifters, although we can't imagine many drivers using them on a plug-in hybrid SUV. Compared to the non-plug-in hybrid Crown Sport, this new variant has extra bracing in the floor tunnel for greater body rigidity.
Since this is a plug-in hybrid, it predictably excels in terms of efficiency. Located beneath the floor in the center of the vehicle is a lithium-ion battery with enough juice for a pure electric range of 56 miles (90 kilometers). It takes 38 minutes to charge the battery to 80 percent. Factor in the gasoline tank with its capacity of 14.5 gallons (55 liters), and the vehicle will be able to cover more than 746 miles (1,200 kilometers).
It rides on large 21-inch black wheels with wider tires and benefits from an adaptive suspension with modified shock absorbers. Toyota goes as far as to say the Crown Sport PHEV delivers a ""planted ride.""
One neat feature is support for bidirectional charging as the 1,500W (AC 100V) external power supply function might come in handy in an emergency. It can also power a variety of devices an outdoorsy person might need out in the wilderness. The Crown Sport PHEV costs 7,650,000 yen (about $52,900) and Toyota expects to move about 300 units each month.

This Nissan Disaster Support Van Uses Leaf Batteries For Onboard Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/701185/nissan-2024-tokyo-auto-salon/,There will also be a concept with denim upholstery.,12/25/2024 9:06,"Essentially Japan's SEMA show but more tasteful, the Tokyo Auto Salon is taking place next month. Nissan is attending the event with a comprehensive lineup of customized vehicles based on existing production cars, plus the Formula E race car.
The Disaster Support Mobile-Hub is based on the Caravan and gets a portable power station by repurposing old batteries from the Nissan Leaf electric hatchback. As the concept's name implies, the van-based mobile support hub is intended to be used in case of disasters such as earthquakes and floods when there's no power.
Sold in Japan as the X-Trail, Nissan is teasing the Rogue alongside the Crawler Concept. It has a raised suspension and a chunky roof rack with a built-in LED light bar. The rock-crawling SUV probably rides on all-terrain tires and has a beefier body kit with extra cladding. Nissan says the cargo compartment ""contains the tools that have always been looked for in the X-Trail.""
In case you're unfamiliar with the Roox, it's a tiny minivan developed to comply with the kei car regulations. It’s based on the Mitsubishi eK Space and went through a facelift in Japan a few months ago. This Beams Customized Concept has been created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion house Beams and incorporates denim fabric inside and out.
Just as quirky is the March Customized Concept. March is the name used by Nissan in its domestic market for the Micra supermini. For the 2024 TAS, the small hatchback has been modified to fit the needs of a pastry chef. It boasts a variety of wooden elements and has a menu written down on the rear doors' windows.
Joining these cars will be sportier-looking versions of the X-Trail Autech crossover and Serena Autech minivan as well as Nismo variants of the Skyline, Z, and GT-R. The next Tokyo Auto Salon takes place January 12-14, 2024.

2026 Cadillac Vistiq Three-Row SUV Is The Electric Baby Escalade,https://insideevs.com/news/700432/2026-cadillac-vistiq-debut/,The tailgate badge suggests the Vistiq gets the Lyriq AWD's dual-motor powertrain rated at 500 hp and 450 lb-ft.,12/14/2023 9:00,"Cadillac has way more electric vehicle models in the ""upcoming releases"" section than in showrooms, and you can add a new one to that list—the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq midsize SUV.
Don't get us wrong, the more EVs the better, but we hope Cadillac will be able to launch and manufacture these new models as planned. After all, the Lyriq's rollout has been far from ideal in that respect. Now, GM's luxury arm describes the Vistiq as a ""distinctive and innovative"" EV designed for the modern family, but unfortunately, it provides very few details about the new model.
The Vistiq looks like a good addition to the lineup, but when will it launch?
The 2026 Cadillac Vistiq will join a market segment that's not that crowded at the moment, that of mid-size luxury three-row electric SUVs. But GM has had so many delays with its EVs that we can't help but wonder when the Vistiq will hit the market—the fact that it's a 2026 model year doesn't look that encouraging.
This is a new luxury three-row SUV that will slot between the Lyriq—Cadillac's only EV on sale at the moment—and the forthcoming Escalade IQ. Think of it as the all-electric equivalent to the Cadillac XT6 but with the same styling language we've already seen on the Lyriq, Optiq, and Escalade IQ.
Actually, it looks like a baby Escalade IQ, although the body appears slightly better proportioned in these photos. Photos of the interior aren't available yet, but we should probably expect influences from both the Lyriq and Escalade IQ when it comes to the looks and functionality of the cabin.
""Vistiq adds another compelling EV to the Cadillac lineup, reinforcing our commitment to an electric future,"" said John Roth, vice president of Global Cadillac. ""Our brand now has an EV entry in most luxury segments, offering customers a range of choices, and Cadillac EVs will cover most luxury SUV segments across critical global markets in the next two years.""
Additional Vistiq details, including available features and pricing, will be released sometime next year when the full unveiling takes place. The Vistiq utilizes GM's Ultium battery and drive units, just like the other electric SUVs Cadillac has announced so far and the rest of the GM EV family. Given its size and positioning, it may use the BEV3 architecture and not the Escalade IQ's BT1 SUV/truck platform that's shared with the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and more upcoming models.
It remains to be seen which drivetrain configurations the Vistiq will offer, but a dual-motor AWD setup is a given, either standard or as an option. We say that because of the ""600E4"" badge visible on the Vistiq's tailgate in one of the photos. The ""600"" represents the rounded torque figure in Newton-meters (for some reason), while ""E4"" stands for ""electric"" and ""four-wheel drive.""
More stories on all-electric Cadillac models
An identical badge is used by the Lyriq AWD, so it's safe to assume that the Vistiq gets the same dual-motor AWD powertrain that makes 500 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque. Does it also get the 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a range of 307 miles in the Lyriq? We don't know, but if it does, we expect the range to take a significant hit. A single-motor RWD powertrain could be offered as standard, but that's just speculation.
The Escalade IQ's standard AWD setup that delivers 680 hp and 615 lb-ft of torque in the normal driving mode would probably be a good fit as a range-topping powertrain for the Vistiq, although we doubt Cadillac will put a 200-kWh+ battery in its midsize SUV.
Still, the beauty of GM's BEV3 platform and its Ultium batteries and drive units is that they're very modular and configurable, so General Motors has probably been able to tailor the ideal drivetrain for the Vistiq, including a right-sized battery pack.
The Vistiq is Cadillac's fifth EV and the third one confirmed this year, after the Escalade IQ and the Optiq, which acts as the Cadillac EV lineup's entry point in North America starting in 2024. How will the Vistiq stack up when it goes on sale? And more importantly given it's a 2026MY, when will it go on sale?",Dan Mihalascu
"Tesla Model 3 RWD, Long Range Will Lose The Entire EV Tax Credit In 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/700533/tesla-model-3-rwd-long-range-lose-entire-tax-credit-2024/,Tesla’s most affordable EV takes a hit because of its Chinese-sourced batteries.,12/13/2023 6:39,"Buyers of Tesla’s most affordable model, the Model 3 sedan, will no longer be eligible for the $7,500 U.S. electric vehicle tax credit starting next year, at least when it comes to the Rear-Wheel Drive and Long Range versions.
The news comes from Tesla itself, which already updated its website to reflect the change, likely as a result of the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance that was announced at the beginning of the month.
Confusion around the EV tax credit rules trickles down to car shoppers
The U.S. EV tax credits are changing again in January 2024, to crack down on battery materials from ""foreign entities of concern"" like China. It's confusing to buyers, and losing tax credits a car as important and affordable as the Model 3 could mean bad news for EV sales.
Previously, the electric automaker had a slightly different language on its webpage, instructing potential buyers to take delivery of their new Model 3 before the end of the year because starting from 2024, the RWD and Long Range variants of the EV might benefit from just half of the tax credit.
However, things have changed and buyers of the sedan’s two cheapest options will no longer be eligible for the $7,500 incentive at all. With this being said, the Performance trim doesn’t seem to be affected by this change, at least for now.
Here’s what Tesla says on its website regarding the change:
Customers who take delivery of a qualified new Tesla vehicle and meet all federal requirements are eligible for a tax credit up to $7,500. Tax credit will end for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on December 31, 2023 based on current view of new IRA guidance. Take delivery by December 31 to qualify for full tax credit.
Currently, all the Model 3 trims, the Model X Dual Motor, and the Model Y Long Range and Performance are eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit. That said, there are price caps in place: $55,000 for the Model 3 and $80,000 for both the Model X and Model Y.
In the case of the Model Y, Tesla says that reductions in the tax credit are likely after December 31. However, there is no such language when it comes to the Model X, which incidentally has a starting price of $79,990–just $10 under the $80,000 price cap.
More Stories Like This
Most likely, the change that affects Tesla’s most affordable model has to do with the fact that it’s powered by Chinese-made batteries, but the company hasn’t released details on why the two Model 3 variants are losing the entire tax credit eligibility. The updated tax rules state that any vehicle containing battery components from a so-called “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) like China will be disqualified from receiving tax breaks.
Ultimately, it's certainly not great news for Tesla, which saw record-breaking growth this year—and the continued domination of the U.S. market—thanks to the affordability of the Model 3 and Model Y. It's possible Tesla could cut prices further to compensate, but its investors are already nervous about these changes cutting into profit margins. Even worse off may be other automakers, most of whom can't match Tesla's ability to produce EVs at scale and could see their tax credits evaporate in a few weeks too.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Is Officially Going Racing,https://www.motor1.com/news/699916/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-cup/,The Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup car is also getting a lowered sports suspension and slick tires.,12/25/2024 9:06,"Hyundai held its N Festival in South Korea last night to celebrate its racing achievements in 2023. But there was a surprise. Hyundai revealed concept images of the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup race car along with some juicy technical specifications, with the goal to finish development work in February 2024.
Featuring an aggressive body kit with massive air intakes, a large diffuser, and a rear wing, the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup sits on 18-inch wheels wrapped in 280/680 R18 slick tires. It gets a stiffer suspension setup lowering the ride height by as much as 2.8 inches. Stopping power is supplied by six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers, and to quickly lift the car, it has an air jack. Hyundai is also giving it a six-point, FIA-compliant roll cage, and upgraded battery protection.
The biggest change will be the weight loss, which estimated to be as much as 551 pounds (250 kilograms). Full details have yet to be disclosed since the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup is still being developed, but we do know the side and rear glass is being replaced with polycarbonate. We still don't know how much the street-legal Ioniq 5 N weighs, but it’s estimated to tip the scales at 4,650 lbs (2,109 kg).
Additional hardware changes include an adjustable suspension with spherical-joint pillowball mounts to stiffen the connection with the chassis. It also has disconnectors in case the battery runs too hot. Each team that will race the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup will have its own fake engine sound. In addition, the drivers will be allowed to simulate gear changes by using the N E-Shift function, which mimics the behavior of an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
The Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup is more than just for show since it'll actually go racing. If everything goes according to plan, it'll hit the track as early as May 2024 in what Hyundai refers to as Korea's first one-make EV competition.

BYD Seal Lands In Mexico To Taunt The Tesla Model 3 From The Other Side Of The Border,https://insideevs.com/news/699895/byd-seal-north-america-debut/,The Chinese sedan is one of the most compelling EV contenders to enter North America. But would you buy one in the U.S.?,12/8/2023 8:57,"The BYD Seal, which is considered one of the better competitors to the Tesla Model 3, has officially launched in North America, according to CarNewsChina. But don’t get your hopes too high because the EV’s arrival in the United States is still uncertain.
But take a trip over the border to Mexico, and you’ll be able to check out the Chinese battery-powered car in person–along with its sticker price.
Representing the fifth battery-powered car to be sold in Mexico by BYD, after the Han sedan, Tang SUV, Yuan Plus crossover, and Dolphin hatchback, the Seal starts at 778,800 pesos, or about $44,800, for the entry-level rear-wheel drive version.
This comes with a 150-kilowatt (201 horsepower) rear-mounted electric motor and a 61.44-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) Blade battery pack that enables a WLTP-rated range of 285 miles (460 kilometers).
There’s also an all-wheel drive version that features two electric motors making a combined 390 kW (529 hp) and a bigger 82.56-kWh LFP Blade battery that offers a WLTP range of 323 miles (520 km). The AWD costs 888,800 pesos, which translates to about $52,000.
More Chinese EVs
Now for the price comparison. In the U.S., the Tesla Model 3 is cheaper, starting at $38,990, but in Mexico, the American EV is actually more expensive than the imported Chinese sedan, with a base MSRP of 881,900 pesos, which is about $50,500.
It’s worth noting that BYD doesn’t sell any of its passenger cars in the United States at the moment, but it’s planning to do so in the future, with a Mexican factory being under consideration. With this being said, the Chinese manufacturer has a presence in the U.S., but for electric buses, assembling mainly school buses at its factory in Lancaster, California.
Chinese cars in general are a very hot topic in the U.S. Due to continued geopolitical and trade tensions between the two countries, Chinese-made cars are subject to stiff 27.5% tariffs, including from established brands like Volvo, and that is keeping companies like BYD from selling in the U.S. for now. But while the tariff is unlikely to vanish anytime soon, BYD and the other major Chinese automakers have huge global plans. And in theory, building cars at their own factories in Mexico—which many of them are planning to do—allows them to sell in the U.S. without the tariffs.
The question is, would American buyers go for a BYD Seal over a Tesla Model 3? In the next few years, we may just find out.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Next Chevrolet Bolt Will Be EUV-Only, GM Confirms",https://insideevs.com/news/699880/gm-bolt-euv-2025/,"The larger version of the popular Bolt is the only one making a comeback in 2025, the automaker told InsideEVs.",12/7/2023 16:42,"The Chevrolet Bolt is having its best sales year ever—right in time for it to get canceled. But General Motors is responding to the immense popularity of the pair of compact electric vehicles by releasing a heavily updated Bolt with more advanced hardware in 2025. And when it does, only the larger Bolt EUV will be on the menu.
GM officials confirmed to InsideEVs this week that the upcoming next-generation Bolt will be EUV-only, citing the overwhelming popularity of the crossover model over the smaller Bolt EV. “We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt. We will share details as we get closer to its launch date,"" a GM spokesperson added. ""We’re excited, as the new Bolt will build on the formula that has made it the success it is today.""
What to know about the Bolt's big(ger) comeback
GM angered quite a few EV fans by killing off the ultra-popular and affordable (but unprofitable) Bolt. Now that it's coming back as a small crossover, its success will depend on keeping that cheap price tag.
That success is clearly pointing in the direction of the crossover model. Though GM doesn't break out the sales figures between the Bolt EV and the Bolt EUV, it's generally believed the latter is outselling the former about two-to-one.
Between January and September, Chevrolet sold 49,494 examples of both models combined, a staggering 125% increase from the same period in 2022. By an extremely wide margin, the Bolt twins have been GM's most popular EVs, especially as it has occasionally struggled to scale up production for next-generation EVs on the Ultium platform like the Cadillac Lyriq, Hummer EV and Silverado EV.
But this year, scores of buyers were drawn to the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV thanks to its low price tag being further cut by the new Inflation Reduction Act's electric tax credits. Between federal and state tax credits, as well as dealer discounts, many Bolt models were acquired in the $20,000 realm—not bad at all for an EV with a respectable 259- or 247-mile range, depending on size.
The Bolt Is Back (In 2025)
At the same time, the Bolt is getting old. The smaller one first debuted way back in 2016 and was joined by the compact EUV crossover in 2022. It is only capable of 55 kW DC fast charging, making it far less quick to add range than more modern rivals. Moreover, the Bolt's older battery setup was said to be long unprofitable, leading to its cancellation earlier this year.
But GM quickly reversed that decision, citing the car's popularity, and said the next Bolt would instead use the Ultium batteries and architecture underpinning other new EVs—thus allowing it to be scaled up profitably.
GM officials, including CEO Mary Barra, have said the next Bolt will not be a clean-sheet redesign but rather an updated version of the current car with lower-cost LFP batteries, faster charging, more advanced active safety features and other significant upgrades. But the plan is to keep the next-gen Bolt around the same level of pricing, which is good news, as high EV costs are continually seen as a major barrier to wider adoption.
In any case, given the Bolt EUV's success with crossover-crazy Americans, it's no wonder that GM would opt to go with that body style as the car's sole Ultium-based successor. If the automaker can hold true to that claim around the low price tag, it will almost certainly have another major hit on its hands.",Patrick George
"Morgan's New Electric Three-Wheeler Only Weighs 1,540 Pounds",https://www.motor1.com/news/699515/morgan-three-wheeler-ev-details/,And it will do 150 miles on a single charge.,12/25/2024 9:06,"Even the smallest automakers must adapt to the inevitable electric future. And for sports car manufacturers focused on weight, installing a battery pack and an electric motor can be a tough task compared to the equivalent combustion engine.
Caterham showed that minimizing the weight penalty is doable with its Project V electric coupe. Now, another British marque is revealing what it has achieved so far in terms of a sporty, lightweight EV.
Meet the Morgan XP-1, an experimental prototype with an all-electric heart. It's based on the Ford-powered Super 3, but it has had its oily bits yanked off to make room for the new hardware. Fun fact: This car uses Morgan's first powertrain developed in-house, regardless of whether we're talking about a combustion engine or an electric motor.
To keep development costs low, the engineers mounted the electric motor in the existing transmission tunnel. It's good for 134 horsepower (100 kilowatts) routed to that single rear wheel. The e-motor gets its juice from a tiny 33-kilowatt-hour battery pack mounted under the hood where you'd normally find the gasoline engine in the Super 3. Fully charged, the battery is good for approximately 150 miles (241 kilometers) of range.
Tipping the scales at less than 1,543 pounds (700 kilograms), the Morgan XP-1 is only about 132 lbs (60 kg) heavier than its gas counterpart. While the donor car has a drag coefficient of 0.65, the Cd has dropped to 0.42 after tweaking the underbody, wheels, and front fascia. These changes have lowered the drag coefficient by a third to maximize efficiency.
The Morgan XP-1 has been developed with four selectable drive modes that are hilariously illustrated on the digital driver's display by chili symbols. To cope with the extra heft, the electric three-wheeler has been fitted with Nitron adjustable dampers while the spring rates have been changed. As for the battery, it supports fast charging, and it even has a bi-directional charging capability.
Morgan isn't ready to talk about a potential production version, but Chief Technical Officer Matt Hole told Autocar it would cost ""just north of Super 3."" The Ford-powered model retails for $53,938 in the United States where there are 12 showrooms.

Honda To Unveil A Whole New 'EV Series' At CES In January,https://insideevs.com/news/699494/honda-ces-preview-2024/,"If Honda is really getting serious about EVs, we may see some evidence soon.",12/6/2023 9:00,"Honda has been saying for a while now that it plans to sell 30 new all-electric models by 2030. I don't know if any of you have checked the calendar recently, but by my calculations, that's six years and 25 days from now. At present, Honda's global electric presence includes the not-for-North America Honda e, some joint venture stuff for China, the upcoming Prologue SUV with hardware on loan from General Motors and a few other stragglers. Just how does Honda think it's going to accomplish that lofty goal, exactly?
We may get some answers to that $40 billion question in January at CES. There, the Japanese automaker says it's going to unveil a ""global EV series [and] several key technologies that illustrate the significant transformation Honda is currently undergoing."" A number of Honda executives will be at the tech trade show to speak to what's next for the apparently electric future.
More Honda News
""Toward its global goal to achieve carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities by 2050, Honda will introduce 30 new EVs globally by 2030 with a global sales volume of 2 million units,"" the automaker said in a news release. ""In North America, Honda has laid out an aggressive timeline of EV introductions leading to 2030 and ultimately to 100% zero-emission automobile sales by 2040, which includes battery electric and fuel cell electric-powered models.""
For now, that's all we know. The announcement came with this cryptic teaser, which you can see above. It's hard to draw any real conclusions from that image; it looks. to be some kind of sleek concept car with a sharply angled windscreen and a flat nose, if that's the front end, and I think it is.
Truth be told, it's great to see Honda get serious about EVs—an area where all of the Japanese automakers are sorely lacking at present, much to the chagrin of their environmentally minded fans. (Honda's even down to just two hybrids in the U.S., though a third is coming.) But of all of Japan's car companies, Honda built its legendary reputation on a total approach to what you'd call ""mobility"" today—cars, motorcycles, scooters, lawnmowers, even planes and robots—and brilliant engineering solutions. If any of those car companies can come up with truly memorable entries in the EV space, I always thought it might be Honda. And it's worth noting that Honda just scrapped its partnership for small, affordable EVs with GM, so whatever this plan is, it seems to be a solo act.
Now, things do seem to be looking up on the electrified front for Honda. It's got more hybrids coming, including the 2024 Civic Hybrid and the all-but-confirmed Honda Prelude. (I've seen the latter up close and in person twice now, and if anyone thinks it's just a ""concept,"" I have a bridge to sell them.) It's also got more in the works for electric motorcycles and scooters; plans to re-tool its plants in Ohio and Japan for EV production; and the Prologue's upscale cousin, the Acura ZDX.
Here's hoping for positive and concrete news out of CES come Jan. 9. The world could use more great electric Hondas, and ones Americans can actually buy, too.",Patrick George
The 2024 Lucid Air Lineup Just Got A Whole Lot Simpler,https://insideevs.com/news/699263/lucid-air-2024-updated/,"The Pure gets more range, but the 1,050 horsepower Grand Touring Performance trim is dead.",12/5/2023 9:00,"I love the Lucid Air. It’s one of my favorite EVs on the market. But it seems like not everyone else has felt the love, if the brand’s lackluster sales are any indication. (The approximately $80,000 to $250,000 price tag may have contributed to this.) Regardless, it looks like Lucid’s gearing up for a fight to win the hearts and minds of the EV-buying public. For 2024, the startup has made the car even more competitive and alluring with an updated model line that includes adjusted pricing, reworked trim levels, a new color and new packages so consumers can spec their Air sedan just to their liking.
First up is the Pure trim. Acting as the entry to the Lucid brand, it starts at $77,400, slightly cheaper than its 2023 price. The next trim up, the Touring, now starts at $85,900—a sizable reduction from the $95,000 in 2023. However, the real story is how simplified the model lineup is for 2024, all while making the base Air Pure a better deal.
For example, the Pure trim now has a choice of interior themes and materials. Consumers can equip the natural grain or nappa leather interior options, rather than just the PureTex grey synthetic leather interior options. The Pure trim can now be had with 14 or 20-way power seats that have both ventilation and massage features.
Mechanically, the Air’s powertrain lineup is simplified. The dual motor Pure AWD is dead, making the Pure trim RWD, a single motor only. The motor itself still makes the same 430 horsepower as before, but this time the car now returns an estimated 419 miles of range, up from 410 miles from last year's model.
If you’re in search of extra power and AWD, you’ll now have to step up to the Air Touring. The Touring model is now the cheapest way to get an AWD dual-motor Lucid Air, and at 620 horsepower, it’s way faster than the outgoing AWD Air Pure.
The Touring and Pure are both available with a new Comfort and Convenience package. This package adds niceties like a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, soft-close doors, four-zone climate control, and power rear sunshades. When equipped on the Touring model, Lucid throws in a power opening and closing frunk and heated wipers. Oh, and that Fathom Blue exterior paint once only found on the base model Pure trim is now available on the Touring and Grand Touring models.
Speaking of the Grand Touring, Lucid updated that model as well. But it hasn’t quite let all of the details out. It too, will get the optional 20-way power seats and mechanical upgrades via an “updated powertrain that enhances thermal performance and enables more sustained spirited driving.” But, the actual pricing, range, and battery capacity are still to be determined. Lucid says it expects the Air Grand Touring to remain the longest-range electric luxury sedan in the US, though. Sadly, the 1,050 horsepower Grand Touring Performance model is gone from the lineup.
These updates seem like a solid way to make a good car more compelling in an increasingly crowded EV luxury market. For Lucid’s sake, let’s hope these updates are enough to get drivers behind the wheel of the Air. And down the line, backup is coming in the form of the Lucid Gravity SUV as well.
Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that the Lucid Air Touring was $95,000 in 2023, not $87,500.

"The 2024 Fiat 500e Is A $32,500 Answer To Big, Expensive EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/699277/2024-fiat-500e-revealed/,Fiat’s iconic city car returns to the U.S. with 149 miles of range and a price that’s tough to beat.,12/5/2023 0:01,"The U.S. is in dire need of electric cars that are affordable to everyday consumers. Right now, if you pick a new EV at random, it’s likely to cost upwards of $50,000. And that just isn’t realistic for most people—especially those taking the plunge into an unfamiliar technology.
Good news: A new, relatively accessible option will arrive early next year in the form of the 2024 Fiat 500e. The iconic Italian city car is returning stateside after a brief hiatus, and Fiat unveiled it to the world on Tuesday. It went on sale in Europe in 2020.
The (500e)RED edition, the first model available, will start at $32,500 plus a $1,595 destination fee. While that isn't exactly cheap, it's a lot less than the average going price for an EV, which was $51,762 in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Fiat plans to “drop” future variants in limited quantities, as fashion brands do. While I’m not sure people will line up for the latest Fiat colorway like they do for Supreme hoodies, Fiat thinks there’s something to the strategy.
Just like its predecessor, the new 500e sports two doors, four seats, retro-inspired flair, and a tiny footprint meant for squeezing into the tightest of parking spots. In a time when automakers keep doubling down on bulky electric pickups and SUVs, some buyers may appreciate a legitimately compact and energy-efficient option. Plus, Fiat says the updated model is both longer and wider than before, yielding more interior space.
The (500e)RED’s funky cabin features lots of red accents, a rounded gauge cluster, and a red dashboard insert made of shiny plastic. Alongside the 7-inch driver-facing display is a 10.25-inch center touchscreen equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Now for the really important stuff: range and charging. Fiat estimates the 500e’s range at 149 miles, which is roughly what you’d expect from such a small car with a consequently tiny 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack.
Interestingly, the 500e will be sold with a Level 2 charger that buyers can have installed in their garage or driveway. When plugged into a Level 2 connection (faster than a regular wall outlet, not as fast as DC public fast-charging), the hatchback can top up its battery in four hours and 15 minutes, Fiat says.
Using a DC fast charger (the more powerful kind found at highway rest stops and Tesla Supercharger locations), the 500e can recharge from empty to 80% in 35 minutes, according to Fiat. The 500e maxes out at a charging rate of 85 kW, slower than most other EVs. But it all balances out, since the car’s small battery pack doesn’t need much time to charge anyway.
The car’s 118 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque propel it to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, Fiat says. There are three drive modes. “Normal” is, well, normal. “Range” intensifies regenerative braking to slow the car down harder and send more power to the battery pack under braking. The oddly named “Sherpa” mode maximizes the remaining range by capping the 500e’s power output and top speed.
More Cheap EVs
In somewhat gimmicky news, at low speeds, the 500e doesn’t just emit the typical drone required of EVs for pedestrian awareness. It “sings.”
From Fiat: “The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) ‘sings’ to pedestrians with a song titled ‘The sound of 500,’ authored by Flavio Ibba-Marco Gualdi. The exclusive melody gives a taste of Italian culture during the first moments of every drive.” That doesn’t sound annoying at all. Nope.
So, is the 500e a good buy? That depends on what you’re after. Rivals include the Mini Electric, which is in the same ballpark as the 500e cost-wise but delivers only 114 miles of range. Then there’s the stalwart Nissan Leaf, which starts at around $25,000 (after a $3,750 federal tax credit) for a model with 149 miles of range. A 259-mile Chevrolet Bolt can be had for roughly $20,000, including a $7,500 kickback from the federal government.
For buyers who don’t need road-tripping range and want something they can park anywhere, the 500e may be just the ticket.",Tim Levin
"Tesla Cybertruck Battery Size, Heat Pump And Colored Charging Indicator Revealed In EPA Docs",https://insideevs.com/news/699248/tesla-cybertruck-battery-size-and-heat-pump/,"Here's what we know from the official specs, including the gross weight of the Cyberbeast.",12/4/2023 17:30,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released its official Tesla Cybertruck filings, revealing additional details about the stainless steel triangle on wheels that few people seem to have had enough of. The information in the documents, reviewed by InsideEVs, is not earth-shattering by any measure, but some details are worth noting.
For starters, the Certification Summary Information Report, filed on November 21, 2023, just ten days before the buoyant delivery event, mentions the total voltage of battery packs at 816 volts, battery energy capacity at 150 (amp hours, we believe), and battery specific energy at 170 (watt-hours per kilogram, we believe). That leaves us with 122.4 kilowatt-hours of energy capacity—in line with the unofficial value of 123 kWh in some reports. Annoyingly, Tesla does not release the battery capacity of its EVs.
Moving on, the initial application for the Certificate For Conformity was filed by Tesla on November 11, 2023, and that document confirms the presence of a heat pump. Well, that’s not entirely surprising because most new Teslas get the heat pump, and we also saw some spy shots early this year, shared by members of the Cybertruck Owners Club, that exposed the cooling systems behind the frunk.
For those who don’t know, Tesla’s ingenious heat pump design is its solution to minimize heat losses and maximize range and efficiency. In principle, heat pumps reuse the heat generated by the battery and drive units to warm the cabin, save energy, and improve the range on long drives—they’re crucial in the winter when range losses tend to be higher. Here’s what the document says about the heat pump:
The heater unit incorporating a variable speed electric fan is located in the front of the chassis tub with ducting directing the blown air to defrost, face level and floor level vents in the passenger compartment. The heater element is of the heat pump, drawing HV electrical energy from the battery pack High Voltage.
It goes on to mention how the HVAC system reduces energy usage in both heating and cooling scenarios:
The energy required to heat the cabin varies by weather and occupant comfort needs, but on average consumes approximately 10 percent of the total energy available for driving. However, even in moderately cold weather (0 degrees Celsius), consumption can increase to 25 percent or more. A heat pump consumes a small amount of electrical energy to thermodynamically “upgrade” low-temperature (less useful) thermal energy to higher-temperature (more useful) thermal energy, making it suitable for occupant comfort. That is, for a given electrical power input, a heat pump will return 1 to 5x in useful heating power; an electrical cabin heater provides 1:1 in heating power, and therefore is far less efficient.
That said, we also found a quirky little detail about the Cybertruck’s charging. The charging port, mounted on the rear left fender, will put on a colorful display regarding its state of charge (SoC). For example, a solid white illumination indicates that the charging cable can be removed or inserted. An orange light would indicate that the cable isn’t properly latched, and a flashing blue light would signal that charging is underway as expected, among others.
Lastly, the curb weight of the Cyberbeast is 6,898 pounds, and the all-wheel-drive tips scale at 6,669 pounds. The gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is 9,169 pounds for both variants. We were hoping to find details about the rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck, due in 2025, as well. But the EPA hasn’t made those files public yet. That said, the EPA documents are publicly available, so anyone can review them. Let us know if you find any additional interesting nuggets of information worth highlighting.

"Tesla Model 3 RWD, Long Range EV Tax Credits Halved For 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/699154/tesla-model-3-rwd-long-range-ev-tax-credits-halved-for-2024/,"The change goes into effect January 1, 2024, likely as a result of the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance announced last week.",12/4/2023 8:10,"Some potentially bad news for any hopeful Tesla owners next year: the two most popular Model 3 variants, the RWD and Long Range, will see their federal tax credits halved come Jan. 1, 2024 thanks to new rules around battery materials in electric cars.
Instead of being eligible for up to $7,500 as it's still the case now, the two Model 3 trims will qualify for up to $3,750 starting next year under the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance announced last week.
Tesla has confirmed this on its customer website, informing prospective customers that they can still get the full tax credit if they take delivery of a Model 3 RWD or Long Range by Dec. 31.
""Customers who take delivery of a qualified new Tesla and meet all federal requirements are eligible for a tax credit up to $7,500. Tax credit will reduce to $3,750 for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on Jan 1, 2024. Take delivery by Dec 31 for full tax credit. Only for eligible cash or loan purchases,"" reads Tesla's announcement.
The electric automaker had posted a similar message on its Model 3 page since July, informing customers that reductions to the federal tax credit were ""likely"" starting from 2024. However, Tesla did not say which Model 3 variants might see their federal tax credit reduced at the time.
Now the new tax rules are clear, and the Model 3 RWD and LR are likely penalized because their battery packs contain components from a so-called ""foreign entity of concern""—in this case, China. Tesla has not revealed details on why its Model 3 variants are losing full tax credit eligibility.
If you're in the market for a Tesla Model 3 and want to take advantage of the full tax credit this month, you should know the electric sedan also comes with six months of free Supercharging if you take delivery by Dec. 31.
More Tesla Model 3 stories
This promotion is likely part of Tesla's efforts to boost sales for the 2023 calendar year. In its third-quarter earnings call on October 18, the company reiterated its 1.8 million vehicle delivery goal. In the first three quarters of this year, Tesla delivered 1,324,074 vehicles worldwide, the vast majority of which were Model Y and Model 3 EVs (1,278,169 units).
As for what will happen with U.S. EV prices under the revised tax credit rules next year, that remains unclear. More models could see their tax credits evaporate until EV and battery production scales up in the U.S. without Chinese materials, which could hurt EV adoption in the meantime. But given his penchant for rapid-fire price changes this year alone, it's entirely possible Tesla CEO Elon Musk will make his own tweaks to keep his company's sales up.",Dan Mihalascu
"BMW iM3 Will 'Never' Happen, Says M Boss",https://www.motor1.com/news/698755/bmw-im3-ev-not-happening/,But that's not to say an M3 with batteries won't.,12/25/2024 9:06,"Earlier this week, BMW filed a trademark for the name ""iM3."" Combining BMW's electric ""i"" and performance ""M"" badges would theoretically suggest a hot EV, but BMW M boss Frank van Meel is here to quickly shut down those rumors.
In an interview with Top Gear, van Meel said the company would ""never"" use i and M badges together on the same vehicle. ""No, that will be a Mission Impossible!"" he says. ""Actually, we would never use an i on an M, even though it would be electric.""
That's not to say that a performance EV with a pure M badge won't happen, though. ""If we would ever do something like that, it will always be called an M without an i,"" suggests van Meel, ""because that's just the technology, and M is not about technology. It’s about a promise, it’s about motorsports, it’s about emotion. It’s not about the drivetrain.""
BMW already has four M-badged EVs – the iX M60, i4 M50, i5 M60, and the i7 M70 – and the company debuted a quad-motor performance prototype in 2022 that looked suspiciously like a 3 Series. So the BMW Neue Klasse electric platform is bound to breed a performance EV, it just won't be called the iM3.

UPDATE: You Can Reserve A Tesla Cybertruck,https://insideevs.com/news/698521/tesla-no-cybertruck-reservations/,The price to reserve one has gone up though.,11/30/2023 16:21,"UPDATE: Just moments ago, Tesla re-opened reservations for the Cybertruck. Reservations are now $250 and are still fully refundable.
Original article continues below...
As of last night, Tesla is no longer taking reservations for the Cybertruck. Perhaps the millions who have already reserved a Cybertruck are more than Tesla thinks it can handle in the foreseeable future.
Tesla's Cybertruck landing page now shows a countdown timer to tomorrow's big delivery event. There is no longer a way to bank a reservation for the Cybertruck, which means that, at least for now, reserving a Cybertruck is not possible.
Prior to removing the option to reserve a Cybertruck, Tesla briefly updated the page to show a $250 reservation fee, which is higher than the initial $100 reservation fee. The change didn't last for long though, as Tesla quickly reverted back to the $100 amount before removing the option to reserve one.
According to some crowdsourced info, Tesla Cybertruck reservations surpassed 2 million back in September of this year. The same crowdsourced tracker estimated that Cybertruck reservations reached 1 million in May 2021, 1.25 million in August 2021, and 1.3 million in November 2021. We suspect the number to be significantly higher now that the debut is near and the truck has been out on public roads and on display in recent months.
The anticipation continues to build ahead of tomorrow's Cybertruck debut and delivery event, which is set to begin at 3 P.M. Eastern time. We'll livestream the event and have full coverage of everything Cybertruck, so be sure to join us tomorrow for all of the Cybertruck news.

Tesla Cybertruck: The Full Delivery Specs,https://insideevs.com/news/698764/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-specs-power-range-price/,"Dimensions, towing capacity and more. Here’s everything you need to know about the Cybertruck. Finally.",11/30/2023 15:46,"Remember when the Tesla Cybertruck was first revealed four years ago? Yes, it’s been that long, but the wait is sort of, kind of finally over because the first production-spec units of the heavily anticipated electric pickup truck have been delivered during a special event held at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas, right next to the factory that is building Tesla's latest passenger EV.
And I say that the wait is sort of over because just 10 to 50 units were reportedly delivered at today’s event, depending on who you ask, so the bulk of reservation holders–all two million of them, according to an unofficial tracker–will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on what is arguably one of the most controversial cars in recent history.
So, after years of speculation, spy shots, rumors, and a fair share of confusing messages from none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the cat is out of the bag, at least in terms of official specs.
The Cybertruck, in all its production-spec glory, has a maximum combined power output of 845 horsepower in the so-called Beast Mode. According to Tesla, the Cybertruck is capable of accelerating faster than a Porsche 911 while towing a Porsche 911.
The front drive unit itself makes over 300 hp and features an electro-mechanical differential lock that should come in handy when going off-road. There's no word on a rear locker, but Tesla said that the Cybertruck has active torque vectoring. Additionally, in a first for Tesla, there's a steer-by-wire system instead of a traditional mechanical steering column.
As per the company's website, there are three versions on offer: Rear-Wheel Drive with an estimated 250 miles of range and a 0-60 miles per hour time of 6.5 seconds, All-Wheel Drive with an estimated 340 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds, and Cyberbeast, which can drive up to 320 miles on a full charge (estimated) and can reach 60 mph in 2.6 seconds.
A peculiar Range Extender option also appears on the specs portion of the website. With it, the AWD variant has over 470 miles of range, while the Cyberbeast can go for over 440 miles. According to Elon Musk, there will be an additional battery pack that fits in about one-third of the bed. This can be added or removed depending on the owner's needs.
The front trunk is called the Powergate on the Cybertruck and it's Tesla's first-ever powered frunk. It incorporates one of the longest LED lighting elements on any passenger vehicle in the world, according to the company, and when opened reveals a hidden bench that can seat two, as well as more than seven cubic feet of space.
Compared to the Ford F-150 Lightning's 14.1-cu ft front trunk, the Cybertruck's frunk is about half the size.
In the back of the truck, there's the so-called Vault, which is a fancy way of saying it has an under-bed storage compartment. This doesn't seem big enough for a spare wheel but it's weather-sealed and has a drain hole on the bottom, so it could be used to keep some food and drinks cold in ice, and then when you're done and the ice has melted, you just need to pop off the plug. Speaking of a spare wheel, the Cybertruck doesn't have one.
The bed, which is covered by a powered tonneau cover that retracts behind the rear seats, measures 6 feet long and 4 feet wide. It's made out of sheet-molded composite (SMC) and, according to Tesla, it eliminates the need to install an aftermarket bed liner because it's plenty durable.
Adaptive air suspension comes as standard and offers multiple height settings, similar to the Rivian R1T. At its maximum suspension level, the Cybertruck has a ride height of 17 inches. Rear-wheel steering is also part of the mix.
Pricing starts at an estimated $60,990 for the base RWD model that will be available in 2025. The All-Wheel Drive model will cost an estimated $79,990 when it gets delivered next year, and the Cyberbeast has an estimated MSRP of $99,990 with deliveries expected to begin next year.
The Cybertruck weighs about 6,700 pounds, depending on the version, which is more than the Ford F-150 Lightning which tips the scales at roughly 6,300 lbs but less than the GMC Hummer EV which weighs over 9,000 lbs.
There's still no word on the size of the battery pack.
More Cybertruck Stories
The truck is covered in a Tesla-designed stainless steel alloy, which didn't exist before, according to Elon Musk. It is immune to corrosion, it doesn't need paint, and it gives the Cybertruck more torsional stiffness than a McLaren P1, Musk added.
The company also recreated the failed steel ball experiment from four years ago but this time around Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, didn't seem to use a steel ball but rather a softball that simply bounced off the side of the truck.
According to Tesla's CEO, the Cybertruck's center of gravity is so low that it won't flip over in case of a crash.
Here's a list of all the specs that have been announced today:
Compared to the initial specs that were displayed during the truck’s debut in 2019, the final numbers are slightly worse: lower towing capability, shorter range, and a smaller bed. Four years ago, Tesla’s pickup was advertised with the following specifications:
As you can see, the final version of the truck can't tow or carry quite as much weight as it was originally envisioned. The prices are also higher than what was initially promised, but that's not really a surprise considering everything that happened in the world in the past five years.
It's arguably a controversial car, but now that we know more specs, do you think it lives up to all the hype? Let us know in the comments below.

Watch The Tesla Cybertruck Debut And Delivery Livestream Here,https://insideevs.com/news/698309/tesla-cybertruck-debut-delivery-livestream-video/,The livestream starts at around 3 P.M. Eastern (12 P.M. Pacific).,11/30/2023 8:52,"Today is the day for the first deliveries of the new and hugely anticipated Tesla Cybertruck. This is perhaps the biggest electric vehicle debut of all time and you can watch it live right here.
Years ago, Tesla released specs and details for the Cybertruck, but some figures have likely changed between then and now. We'll briefly cover some aspects of the Cybertruck below and will update this post in real-time as more information becomes available from Tesla.
Tesla Cybertruck Specs From 2019 Debut
The exterior of the Cybertruck is its most polarizing feature. It is stainless steel, which is not the norm in the auto industry. Additionally, its wedge shape is unusual and the angular design is not very common.
What we do know is that the 3-millimeter-thick stainless steel body panels can stop some lighter rounds of ammunition and that the panels could not be penetrated by an arrow shot by Joe Rogan.
We expect that Tesla will offer factory wraps for the Cybertruck if you prefer it in a color that's not stainless steel.
The inside of the Cybertruck is probably the most ""normal"" part of the truck. It's typical Tesla in the sense that, as our own Editor-in-Chief Patrick George put so precisely ""...the standard Tesla playbook clearly applies here: it's sparse, there's a screen and the Model S-style yoke sits in front of the driver.""
The Cybertruck should be available with either a single-motor / rear-wheel-drive setup, a dual-motor / all-wheel-drive setup, or a tri-motor / all-wheel-drive arrangement. The fastest version can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a claimed time of 2.6 seconds.
Tesla says that the Cybertruck comes with an industry-standard 6-foot pickup bed and it boasts a payload capacity of 2,500 pounds cargo capacity. It can tow up to 11,000 pounds.
For off-roading, it features 17 inches of ground clearance, a 35-degree approach angle and a 28-degree departure angle. The electric truck features an adjustable air suspension and four-wheel steering.
When first announced way back when the Cybertruck pricing started at $39,900 for a single-motor RWD model with 250-plus miles of range and a 0-60 time of 6.5 seconds. The tri-motor flagship Cybertruck had a listed price of $69,900.
We expect that there will be significant changes to the official pricing of the Cybertruck and will update this when and if Tesla makes a pricing announcement.
More Cybertruck Range Info
The range was listed at 250-plus miles for the base version of the Cybertruck and over 500 miles for the top-of-the-line version. The mid-level Cybertruck had a range of over 300 miles. These range figures have likely changed since first announced though.
Stay tuned as we'll have a lot more coverage following the livestream of the Cybertruck delivery event.

New Chinese EV Has Giant TV In The Back And Can Measure Disease Risks,https://www.motor1.com/news/698082/skyworth-skyhome-electric-sedan-china/,"Wait, what?!",12/25/2024 9:06,"The Chinese EV industry is booming. Now Skyworth – the automotive subsidiary of Skywell, an electronics company from China – wants to get in on the game with the new Skyhome, a sleek-looking sedan that will go into production next year.
Drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese architectural aesthetics, the EV boasts a design ethos reminiscent of classical pavilions, setting it apart from the conventional EV crowd – or at least that's what the company says in an official press release. One of the highlights is the vehicle's cornice wings, which serve the functional purpose of sliding backward during driving to reduce wind resistance by an impressive three percent. In adverse weather or emergency situations, they tilt up, increasing resistance by five percent for enhanced control.
The Skyhome isn't just about aesthetics, though. The firm responsible for its development says the car has something it calls the Ten Smart Butlers, which is a technology based on AI algorithms, providing a suite of functions ranging from entrepreneurial guidance to emotional support. Yes, you read that part right.
The vehicle's intelligent voice capabilities go beyond the ordinary, boasting the ability to ""listen, speak, see, recognize, understand, and think,"" facilitated by multi-intent voice interaction technology. Even more impressively, the system also incorporates an intelligent non-contact vital signs monitoring system, which is supposed to recognize health risks in very early stages. Again, we are not kidding.
Last but not least, there's also a giant TV for the rear passengers that retracts from the ceiling. We don't know how big it is but from the photos, it looks even bigger than the new BMW 7 Series' 31.1-inch screen at the back.
Skyworth also invested heavily into suspension technology, claiming the new electric sedan has one of the most advanced air suspensions in the industry. It features a double-wishbone front setup, rear aluminum alloy five-link layout, and a perfectly balanced front and rear axle load ratio of 50:50. Also, the overall chassis design with an integrated battery pack, which also acts as the body floor, apparently reduces the number of parts by 127 compared to a conventional EV. The automaker also promises a weight reduction of 24 percent compared to a more conventional design.
There's no official information about the powertrain yet.

Electric Nissan Juke And Qashqai Will Be Inspired By 'Hyper' Concepts,https://insideevs.com/news/697812/electric-nissan-juke-qashqai-will-be-inspired-by-hyper-concepts/,"The electric Juke will be influenced by the Hyper Punk study, while the Qashqai EV will take inspiration from the Hyper Urban concept.",11/24/2023 7:11,"Nissan confirmed it will build all-electric future versions of its Juke and Qashqai SUVs alongside the next-gen Leaf at its plant in Sunderland, UK, and said the new EVs will be inspired by its ""Hyper"" series of concepts recently unveiled at Japan Mobility Show.
The Japanese automaker announced it is investing a total of up to 3 billion pounds ($3.75 billion) in the production of the three EVs, the construction of three battery gigafactories with partner Envision AESC—one more than initially planned—and related infrastructure at its plant in Sunderland, UK.
When finalized, Nissan's EV36Zero hub in Sunderland will produce three electric vehicles and battery cells for them at three gigafactories.
Of the total investment, up to 1.12 billion pounds ($1.41 billion) will be allocated for R&D and manufacturing of the electric Juke and Qashqai announced today. The sum includes facility and manufacturing process improvements, skills training, and tooling for suppliers.
This will be in addition to the 423 million pound ($531 million) investment in the first phase of EV36Zero for the first future EV, the successor to the Leaf entry-level EV. The new model will enter production in Sunderland in 2026.
Interestingly, Nissan said the newly confirmed future EVs to be built in Sunderland will take inspiration from its recently unveiled concept cars.
The Nissan Hyper Urban Concept will influence the design of the future Qashqai EV, while the Hyper Punk Concept will shape the Juke EV. It was already known that the Chill-Out Concept from 2021 would provide inspiration for the next Leaf.
The automaker said it will offer more information about the three upcoming EVs, including names, specifications and launch dates, at a later time.
""Exciting, electric vehicles are at the heart of our plans to achieve carbon neutrality. With electric versions of our core European models on the way, we are accelerating towards a new era for Nissan, for industry and for our customers,"" said Nissan President and CEO, Makoto Uchida.
""The EV36Zero project puts our Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest ever car factory, at the heart of our future vision. It means our UK team will be designing, engineering and manufacturing the vehicles of the future, driving us towards an all-electric future for Nissan in Europe.""
Nissan said the electricity needed to power the production of EVs and batteries in Sunderland will be supplied by the EV36Zero Microgrid, which produces 100% renewable electricity from the company's wind and solar farms—including a brand-new 20MW solar farm.

"VinFast VF7 Compact Crossover Starts At $35,000 In Vietnam",https://insideevs.com/news/697417/vinfast-vf7-vietnam-launch-price-specs/,How will the price change when it makes it to the U.S.?,11/22/2023 9:29,"VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker that currently sells the VF8 and VF9 all-electric crossovers in the United States, has officially launched the smaller VF7 in its home market in Vietnam.
Set to make its way in the United States at some point in the future, the new VinFast VF7 starts at around $35,000 (VND850 million) in the Southeast Asian country, but that’s without owning the high-voltage battery that powers the car. With the battery pack included, the starting price rises to about $41,000 (VND999 million) for the base trim.
For those who want a lower purchase price, there’s the option of leasing the battery pack for approximately $120 (VND2.9 million) per month, which is good for a maximum of 1,864 miles (3,000 kilometers). If an owner drives over the limit, the monthly fee goes up to roughly $198 (VND4.8 million). Customers who want to benefit from the lease deal will also have to cough up a $1,695 deposit (VND41 million), which will be refunded when the contract ends, the battery is returned, or when the vehicle and battery are transferred to another owner.
Currently, the Vietnamese carmaker doesn’t offer a battery lease deal in the United States, and we don’t know if it will ever do, but we do know that the specs are slightly different between the Vietnamese market and U.S.-bound VF7.
In Vietnam, the compact crossover EV will be offered in two trim levels–Base and Plus–while the American market specs revealed at the beginning of the year say the VF7 will come in either Eco or Plus variants.
In its home market, the VF7 Base is set in motion by a single electric motor making 174 horsepower (130 kilowatts) that draws power from a 59.6-kilowatt-hour battery. With it, the EV can travel up to 233 miles on the WLTP test.
The U.S.-spec VF7 Eco, on the other hand, will reportedly have a slightly more gutsy single motor that sends 201 hp (150 kW) to the front wheels and is energized by a larger, 75.3-kWh battery, the same as on the Plus version, which offers the same specs in both markets.
The top trim gets a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for a combined 348 hp (260 kW), while the bigger battery enables a WLTP-estimated driving range of 268 miles on a full charge.
VinFast didn’t say how fast the VF7 can be recharged, but it did say that all models come with 11 basic driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. There’s also a virtual assistant that can answer questions in Vietnamese and in-car voice control.
Penned by Italian designer Torino Design. the new electric crossover benefits from a 10-year or 125,000-mile warranty, whichever comes first, while the battery is covered under a 10-year warranty with no mileage limit. It measures 178.9 in (4,545 millimeters) long and 74.4 in (1,890 mm) wide and has a wheelbase of 111.8 in (2,840 mm).
Customers will be able to reserve a VF7 in Vietnam from December 2 with a non-refundable deposit of approximately $2,000 (VND30 million). Deliveries are expected to begin in early 2024.
We reached out to VinFast to know when the VF7 will make its way to the United States and will update this article when we hear back. But until that happens, let us know what you think in the comments section below: would this electric crossover be a good deal if it starts at around $40,000 in the U.S.?

"China's Latest Electric Super Sedan Looks Outlandish And Has 1,287 HP",https://www.motor1.com/news/696367/hiphi-a-electric-hypercar-debut/,The awkwardly named HiPhi A was developed in cooperation with Apollo Automobil.,12/25/2024 9:06,"Another day, another new electric vehicle from China. This time around we have a rather special model as it promises a sprint to 60 mph in just over two seconds. We’ll get to other numbers in a minute but first, say hello to the new HiPhi A.
For the uninitiated, HiPhi is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer focused on developing and producing luxury and performance cars. The new HiPhi A is based on the Z and no, we aren't talking about the Nissan Z. The company unveiled a chunky electric liftback sedan with 600 horsepower back in March, and well, things have escalated since then. The automaker promises we won’t be dealing only with renderings, either – an actual car will be displayed at the upcoming 2023 Guangzhou Auto Show starting Friday. The first customer deliveries are scheduled for early 2025.
Whereas the Z has a dual-motor electric powertrain, the A is powered by three electric motors. You'll find one on the front axle and two at the back, one for each rear wheel. This is an in-house developed system, which has a peak output of 1,287 hp. The electric energy comes from a battery pack with an as-yet undisclosed capacity that should be capable of discharging up to 1,500 kilowatts at its peak. The powertrain is based on an 800-volt electric architecture – also an in-house development for the company – promising to maintain its peak output for more than 30 minutes. As a result, the top speed of the EV is listed at 186 miles per hour.
From China With Love:
An air suspension system shared with the HiPhi Z is standard, but the A model upgrades that with a rear-steering setup, adaptive dampers, and a new torque-vectoring system. The company also says the electric performance vehicle has a perfect 50:50 weight distribution. HiPhi partnered with Apollo Automobil, the company behind the Intensa Emozione and G2J electric supercars, to bring this new model to life
HiPhi promises to unveil more details in the coming months. We are eager to see whether the new A will be sold in markets outside China as the company already has showrooms in Germany and Norway. Don't get your hopes up for a US launch, though.

2025 Cadillac Optiq Electric Luxury Compact SUV Is The Brand's Entry EV,https://insideevs.com/news/696372/cadillac-optiq-electric-luxury-compact-suv-is-brand-entry-ev/,"Slotting below the Lyriq, the Optiq will be the entry point for Cadillac's EV lineup in North America.",11/17/2023 9:00,"Say hello to the 2025 Cadillac Optiq, the automaker's latest all-electric model after the Lyriq, Celestiq, and Escalade IQ.
Described as a luxury compact SUV, the Cadillac Optiq will slot below the Lyriq and will act as the entry-level model for the brand's EV lineup in North America.
Cadillac hasn't said much else about its new EV other than the fact its ""spirited driving dynamics are designed to appeal to global luxury customers."" The automaker noted that additional details, features, and pricing will be unveiled next year.
The two images released by Cadillac reveal the exterior design of the Optiq in the Sport trim level, and the fact it's labeled a 2025 model suggests it will launch sometime in 2024. It remains to be seen if GM will be able to pull that off given the difficulties it has when it comes to ramping up production of the Lyriq.
From a styling standpoint, the Optiq looks quite similar to the Lyriq, sharing the same design language with the larger electric crossover. However, it gets different details such as smaller upper and lower grilles, different headlights and taillights, a unique C-pillar treatment, and more.
If you feel like you've seen the Optiq before, your memory does not fail you. The vehicle's design was first uncovered in China in August by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The U.S.-spec Cadillac Optiq looks identical with the China-spec model, but we're not so sure if the powertrain specifications will be the same.
In China, the Cadillac Optiq will be available with either single- or dual-motor Ultium Drive powertrains and Ultium batteries. There will be two rear-drive powertrains with 201 horsepower (150 kilowatts) or 241 hp (180 kW), and an all-wheel-drive powertrain making 283 hp (211 kW) and 343 pound-feet of torque.

Built on a variant of GM's BEV3 platform shared with the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Buick Electra E5, and Buick Electra E4, the Cadillac Optiq is not that much smaller than the Lyriq.
It's 189.8 inches long, 75.3 inches wide, and 64.7 inches high, while its 116.3-inch wheelbase is exactly the same as that of the Equinox EV, Electra E5, and Electra E4. For comparison, the Cadillac Lyriq is 196.7 inches long, 77.8 inches wide, and 63.9 inches high, with a wheelbase of 121.8 inches.
Expect the 2025 Cadillac Optiq to be more affordable than the 2024 Cadillac Lyriq, which starts at $58,590 (including destination). Exactly how much cheaper the Optiq will be is anyone's guess, but don't get your hopes up too high as even the 210-hp Chevy Equinox 2RS FWD launch model is priced from $48,995 – and the Optiq is a more upscale model.",Dan Mihalascu
