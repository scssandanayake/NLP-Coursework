The Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Is So Much Car: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/745373/2024-porsche-cayenne-turbo-e-hybrid-coupe-review/,"Tons of power, tons of weight, tons of money.",2024-12-25 01:24:48,"Nothing inspires mixed emotions quite like a performance plug-in hybrid. At first, it seems like a perfect middle ground between gas and electric. There’s smooth, emissions-free driving for running around town, big range and quick refueling for long trips, and huge performance when you let the engine and motor work in tandem.
The new Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid does offer all that. But, it’s not quite as simple as having your cake and eating it too.
Porsche facelifted the third-generation Cayenne for the 2024 model year, and the changes are extensive. For the plug-in hybrid models, the battery capacity increases from 14.1 kilowatt-hours to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, which brings a big bump in electric range. The motor also gets an increase from 134 to 174 horsepower, and combined with a revised twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid produces a ripping 729 hp and 700 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than the old Turbo S E-Hybrid. More than any combustion SUV out there now, save the mechanically similar Lamborghini Urus SE.
But there is a price to pay for this blending of combustion and electricity—and not just the steep $158,995 base price of the 2025 model (our tester was a 2024). Porsche quotes a curb weight of 5,719 pounds for this Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe. The Cayenne GTS Coupe, which uses the same V-8 without the hybrid system, weighs nearly 700 pounds less.
The whole thing is a little absurd. Not just the weight figure on its own, I mean the whole thing. A luxury SUV that nods toward efficiency and the need to reduce our environmental impact but also has a twin-turbo V-8 and weighs as much as two original Boxsters. It’s just so much car.
The weight dominates everything. Admittedly, this Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid coupe handles its weight as well as it can, thanks to the optional rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll systems. It’s freakishly agile and body roll is kept to an absolute minimum when you put it into Sport Plus mode, where the car lowers on its air springs and stiffens up its adaptive dampers. Through corners, this Cayenne doesn’t feel its weight whatsoever.
Steering is precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, but surprisingly light. And below 50 miles per hour, when the rear wheels are calibrated to turn in the opposite direction of the fronts, there’s this slightly unnatural sense of the car castering around that takes a bit to get used to.
Porsche revised the springs and dampers for all facelifted Cayenne models, and here, they provide an uncanny-good spread of soft, cushion-y ride quality and sport-sedan-like handling. Even on the optional 22-inch wheels, big bumps barely make a blip. Basically, it rides and handles in a way that is entirely divorced from its huge weight and tall ride height.
Still, you’re always conscious of the weight under braking. Even slowing down at low speeds for a stop sign, you can feel all that mass shifting around beneath you. It never feels quite right. Also not helping matters is the fact that the braking is inconsistent. It’s always a challenge to blend regenerative braking from the motor and friction braking, especially when you have carbon-ceramic rotors, as our tester does.
Coming to a complete stop around town, you always end up getting a bit more braking than you want. The motor drives through the Cayenne’s eight-speed automatic, so when you’re coming to a stop, the car has to balance motor regeneration with downshifts. You don’t feel the shifts, but the sensation is similar to aggressive engine braking. Trying to be perfectly smooth rolling to an intersection is a real challenge.
Occasionally the hybrid system hiccups when getting up to speed too, but once you’re going, it’s all very smooth. The engine cuts in and out seamlessly, and the motor is always ready to deliver a wallop of torque.
It’s silly quick, unsurprisingly. The electric motor and engine combine to make the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid feel like it’s got a supercharged Chevy V-8 under the hood. You go to pass someone on the highway, and the eight-speed auto downshifts a gear, maybe two, before an endless surge of power. Get on it hard from a low gear, and it’s even more eye-opening. Performance like this was not long ago exclusive to upper-echelon 911s.
This might be heretical to say, but it sounds better than a lot of new 911s, too. As part of the Lightweight Sports Package—a laughable line item for a 5,700-pound car—you get a center-exit sports exhaust, and it’s raucous. Even in its quiet modes, there’s an ever-present burble from the V-8 and a muscle-car thunder with the valves fully open. It’s childish and totally addictive.
Still, the harder you get on it, the more fuel you’re going to burn. Which is, of course, obvious, and normally not a concern in a hi-po SUV. But in a little over a week with the car, I couldn’t stop thinking about fuel economy. I imagined a guilt-free yet powerful V-8 experience, and while the hybrid system can decrease fuel consumption, it doesn’t turn this Porsche into a Prius.
As with all plug-in hybrids, you have to charge it often. Updated Cayenne hybrids get an 11-kilowatt on-board AC charger, so if you have the right setup at home, you should be able to get a full battery in around two and a half hours. And the range is excellent. The EPA says it’ll do 24 miles on a charge, but I regularly saw figures closer to 40 miles.
If you’re driving around town slowly, you’ll get great fuel economy. Hell, you can leave the Cayenne in E-Power mode and the V-8 will never even turn on until you get on the throttle hard. Longer trips at higher speeds are a mixed bag, though. I drove the car 200 miles and back mostly on the highway, but with about 20 miles of slow New York City traffic. With a full battery, I managed nearly 27 mpg compared to 22 mpg with around a quarter of a battery. It’s not nothing! But, it’s still conspicuous consumption.
Ultimately, you’re left with something that's the best of both worlds, and the worst of both worlds. Under the right circumstances, you can get a big efficiency benefit from the hybrid system, but at other times, it’s a lot of extra weight to carry around.
Philosophically, the base Cayenne E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid probably make more sense, pairing a lighter, more efficient V-6 with the same battery and motor. But, the performance and speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick personality typical of a Porsche Turbo is undeniable. I like this thing a lot, even though I also find it totally ridiculous and suspect that it’s likely not quite as satisfying as a pure gas car, or a full EV.
And this being a review of a Porsche, we can’t end before talking about the price. It is so damned expensive. Notably, the base price between this 2024 test car and the equivalent 2025 model jumped from $153,050 to $163,945. The as-tested price of this one rises from $191,230 to just under $200,000. You can skip a lot of the options our tester has, like the $9,070 carbon-ceramic brakes and the $10,700 Lightweight Sport Package (though it is the only way to get these amazing houndstooth seats). Still, it’s a very expensive car no matter how you slice it.
I suppose it’s natural for a complicated car to engender complicated feelings. Some moments, you love it. Others, you’re baffled by it. And often, you’re left astonished by just how silly it is. I sort of want one, and I’m slightly disturbed by that notion.
Like I said earlier, mixed emotions.

Hyundai EV Owners: You Can Get A Tesla NACS Adapter For Free,https://insideevs.com/news/745429/hyundai-nacs-adapter-ev-q1/,Christmas came a couple of days early from Hyundai this year. The Tesla North American Charging Standard adapter will be free in Q1.,2024-12-24 09:00:00,"In recent months, more and more automakers have started selling North American Charging Standard (NACS) adapters to allow owners of their electric vehicles to access the vast Tesla Supercharging network. Ford will sell you one for $200, Polestar and Volvo will hook you up for $230 and General Motors will do it for $225.
But there's even better news if you drive a Hyundai: you'll be able to get a NACS adapter for zero dollars next year. That means that owners of the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and Kona Electric will be able to use Tesla's Supercharger network at no cost whatsoever. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hyundai.
The Korean automaker announced this week that Hyundai EV owners who have purchased or leased their vehicle on or before Jan. 31, 2025 will be able to request an adapter in the MyHyundai online owner portal. ""This Hyundai-authorized adapter will give CCS-port-equipped Hyundai EV drivers access to more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers in the United States,"" the automaker said.
Hyundai officials also indicated the Genesis luxury brand will eventually do the same with details to be announced early next year; no word yet on Hyundai's corporate cousin Kia, although a similar approach could be likely.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 Adapter
Nearly every automaker operating in America is pivoting to Tesla's style of plug—now known as the SAE J3400 standard—and allowing access to Tesla's charging network to give EV owners a better overall experience. Yet Hyundai is arguably making some of the biggest and earliest moves in that direction. The new 2025 Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 will actually include a NACS plug from the factory, and will use the traditional CCS style of plug with a separate adapter of their own. Hyundai officials have said that adapter use will not impact charging speeds for either type of car.
The automaker said that owners can check HyundaiNews.com for future updates.

"VinFast Whistleblower Alleges Structural Flaws 'Could Cause Wheels To Come Off,' Gets Fired",https://insideevs.com/news/745412/vinfast-whistleblower-fired-safety-concerns/,The engineer took to Reddit to with safety and quality concerns over the design of VinFast's suspension and chassis components.,2024-12-23 15:00:00,"It’s an accepted fact that VinFast’s cars aren’t very good. The brand has been plagued with missed delivery dates, poor reviews, low sales and an alarming allegation that it has police detain critics of its products in its home country. Now things are going further. Last week, an engineer responsible for VinFast’s latest models claimed he was fired after an ask me anything thread on Reddit. The engineer, Hazar Denli, became really concerned about the quality of the suspension components on its models.
According to reporting from the BBC, Denli became concerned with VinFast’s approach to speed and deadlines, insisting that the brand was cutting corners with its product, particularly with development on the VF6 and VF7 crossovers that have been slowly making their way out of Vietnam, and into new markets. For instance, Denli said that parts wore out five times as quickly during validation testing as they should have; some parts only lasted as little at 15,000 miles when they should have gone for 95,000 miles. Troublingly, Denli said this premature wear could lead to a loss of control of the vehicles.
""We saw, for example, the front strut-to-knuckle connection was loosening, which could be extremely dangerous,"" Denli told the BBC. ""It could cause a loosening of the entire structure that could cause wheels to come off.
Denli says that JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) conspired with its parent group Tata Group, alongside VinFast, who figured out who made the Reddit thread. When Denli was identified, he was subsequently terminated and his name was blacklisted in an industry recruiting software, the BBC says. Keep in mind that VinFast’s IPO paperwork revealed that Tata Technologies (part of Tata Group) did much of the chassis engineering for all of VinFast’s models, except for the VF3 and VF5.
This is very concerning, and adds onto existing problems for the automaker. An accident involving a VinFast VF8 is already under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. On, April 24, 2024 a VF8 struck a tree, and caught fire, killing the family of four inside. Denli’s claims track with the previous reporting we’ve done at InsideEVs. Earlier this year, we reported on Sonnie Tran, a Vietnamese blogger who was critical of Vinfast’s products in his home country. Tran alleged that VinFast used the police to harass him, even arresting him and threatening jail time if he didn’t take his criticism down.
Right now, VinFast has delivered on its promise to produce the VF3 through VF9, at least in Vietnam. All of these models are on sale, and the brand plans to export them to new markets. Just a few weeks ago one of the alleged vehicles of concern, the VinFast VF6, was officially put on sale in a handful European countries. VinFast still plans to sell these cars in the U.S. by 2026.
We will be watching with interest and concern as to how this will play out. The Vinfast VF8 has 28 complaints according to the NHTSA. Denli is trying to hold JLR to an employment tribunal, claiming he had done nothing wrong.

Tesla’s CyberCab Can Be Driven With An Xbox-Like Controller: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/745398/tesla-cybercab-xbox-controller-drive/,"Tesla's Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel, but it does work with a video game controller.",2024-12-23 13:44:35,"The Tesla Cybercab shocked the world when it made its first appearance without any form of traditional driver controls. We're talking about no steering wheel, no pedals—nothing for someone in the front seat to put their hands (or feet) on to control the car or override the software. It turns out that Tesla's workaround is to pilot the car like a video game, literally.
That small tidbit comes from a report by AutoEvolution which has some sources at the Petersen Museum where the Cybercab is on display until the new year. According to the report, Tesla's super secret method is a small Xbox-like game controller that plugs into the car to control steering and pedal input since, you know, there's no other hardware installed in the car that can do this.
Cybercab controls recently came into question after the Petersen Museum recently showed some behind-the-scenes footage of the Cybercab arriving at its facility. In the video (embedded above), the car can be seen working its way up a ramp with someone in the front seat. People speculated that someone was sitting in the seat to maneuver the car, especially since it was unlikely that Tesla's FSD software could figure out how to navigate inside a building.
It turns out they were right.
AutoEvolution says that its sources confirm this method was used to control the car while it was inside of the museum. The sources also confirmed that the car could be controlled wirelessly from outside (like a big RC car).
We also know that Tesla is working to hire a fleet of robotaxi operators. These teleoperators will work as safety operators when the automaker launches its first company-run fleet—presumably before 2027—although it has a number of kinks to work out first. These operators will likely control the vehicle remotely to remediate safety or navigation problems that the Robotaxis are unable to overcome on their own, similar to how Waymo uses remote operators when it is unsure of how to handle a situation (for example, confirming which lane is blocked by cones so it doesn't get caught in wet cement).
The automaker must also figure out how it plans to launch the service, including the tough human side of the business like vehicle cleaning and maintenance. General Motors recently bowed out of this side of the business after determining the amount of capital it would take for Cruise to launch and maintain its service. Tesla also needs to decide where it will first launch the service, though recent reports indicate that Tesla has its eyes on Texas due to the lack of regulation around autonomous vehicles.
All of that being said, keep in mind that Tesla intends to make these cars available for the general public to purchase. That means these are issues that the public—whether operating their own fleet or personally owned robotaxi—will need to overcome as well. Will the public have their own Tesla controller at the ready in case their car does something unexpected, or if they need to pilot it outside of the operational design domain? With the current state of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, things will have to change before a controller-controlled car can hit the streets. But given Musk's close-knit ties to the president-elect, anything is possible.

Nio Budget Brand Firefly Unveils First EV And It Looks Familiar,https://insideevs.com/news/745344/nio-budget-brand-debut/,Nio wants Firefly to be a global brand selling cars in Europe and the Americas but not in the U.S. for now.,2024-12-23 10:26:37,"Nio has just revealed the first electric vehicle that it wants to sell under its Firefly budget brand, a hatchback that will retail for just over $20,000 in China. When it reaches Europe sometime in the first half of 2025, it will likely cost a lot more than that due to tariffs and markup, but the company believes it will still be competitive, facing rivals from Smart or Mini.
Firefly’s compact EV, known simply as the Firefly EV, has more than a passing resemblance to the Honda e. It is bigger and a bit more rounded, and its unique front and rear light clusters give it a unique identity. Technical details are virtually nonexistent for now. We don't even know if the vehicle is front-wheel-drive or rear-wheel-drive; all we know is what we can see, as well as the fact that it will support battery swapping.
With its rear seat folded, the maximum load volume is 44.1 cubic feet (1,250 liters) and it also has a 3.24-cu-ft (92-liter) frunk.
Nio wants to create a network of Firefly-specific battery swapping stations in Europe, which it says cost about a third compared to the ones it has already installed for vehicles from the main brand. However, we don’t know the vehicle’s battery capacity or range rating, although we do know what the sales model will be.
Unlike the main Nio brand, which has a direct-to-consumer sales model avoiding traditional dealers, Firefly will have a completely different approach. Firefly vehicles will be sold through existing dealer networks, but they won't be dedicated to the brand, so they will likely be sold alongside other brands.
It will likely offer the vehicle without a battery, which you will lease from the manufacturer and pay a subscription to gain access to the swapping station network. This is called “battery as a service” (or BaaS), and it lowers the upfront cost of the vehicle and frees owners from having to worry about battery maintenance, but they will have to contend with monthly payments.
Nio first introduced BaaS in 2020, and in August of 2024, the company revealed that over 70% of buyers chose it. The percentage is much lower in Europe, though, where buyers prefer to pay more to also own the battery pack and not have to pay the monthly fee.

Nissan-Honda Seek Merger Into 'Global Mobility Company' By 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/745364/nissan-honda-merger-cm-2026/,"It's happening. Honda is riding to Nissan's rescue as planned, and it has huge implications for EVs, motorcycles, software and more.",2024-12-23 10:16:09,"The era of consolidation has fully arrived for the automotive industry, and we have electric vehicles to thank.
Granted, that era almost certainly kicked off a few years ago when Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA Group combined into Stellantis. And even before that, the now-late CEO of Fiat Chrysler warned that consolidation was the only way that car companies could survive the immense technological challenges ahead—electrification, autonomous vehicles and so on—without spending themselves into oblivion. But I'd argue the loudest bell has just been rung by Honda and Nissan, whose merger plans are now officially underway. Make no mistake: this is a big deal, and it says a lot about where the car business is going next.
That's the focus of today's Critical Materials, our morning roundup of technology and ""mobility industry"" news. Also on deck: smaller and more affordable vehicles are coming back, and a theory about Tesla CEO's latest moves in Washington, D.C. Let's dig in.
Honda Nissan Mitsubishi CEOs
A mere week after a report in Nikkei Asia indicated Honda and Nissan were considering merging into one company, talks between the two automakers officially kicked off in Japan today. ""Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (""Nissan"") and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (""Honda"") have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to start discussions and considerations toward a business integration between the two companies through the establishment of a joint holding company,"" the two said in a joint news release.
That was certainly quick. But it's probably because Nissan is running out of time. We've covered this company's many problems in the past so I won't recap them in their entirety here, but just recently, its own executives said it had about 12 to 14 months to survive before it would need some kind of restructuring. Enter Honda, a much more profitable and successful company riding to the rescue of one that's been lagging technologically and declining in sales for more than half a decade. And the Japanese government may have pushed the two into action after Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn reportedly eyed acquiring some or all of Nissan—an outcome that the country assuredly wouldn't want.
So how might this work? Here are the highlights, according to their statements today:
And then there's Mitsubishi. In a separate statement, the smaller company—itself a part of the Nissan-Renault Alliance—is part of discussions now about ""the possibility of achieving synergies at an increased level through Mitsubishi Motors’ participation or involvement in the business integration."" Those discussions are set to begin by the end of January, so it's very possible we could see news next year of this merger including three companies instead of two.
So besides Nissan's troubles, why is this happening? Because the future—electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, AI, connected software tech and more—will be tremendously expensive to deliver. It's a sea change for a car industry that spent 100 years making internal combustion vehicles, largely by assembling parts from disparate networks of supplier companies.
But the future is more like what Tesla and the Chinese automakers are doing: it's vertically integrated and focused on technology. And Japan's automakers are sorely behind the rising Chinese power players. They either have to team up to fight together, or become totally irrelevant.
Yet this merger presents a new set of problems. For one, Honda and Nissan have radically different company cultures; one is led by the engineers, the other by the sales and finance guys. And there's no guarantee that their combined resources will let them catch up quickly enough.
Finally, there's the question of whether these mergers are really beneficial or not. The Volkswagen Group and Stellantis have tremendous scale between them, but both conglomerates have had disastrous years in Europe and abroad. Perhaps Nissan-Honda-Mitsubishi's focus being on Japan, Asia and the U.S. will help avoid the disparate challenges the other two giants deal with. But becoming the world's third-largest automaker will not fix their mutual problems overnight.
Make no mistake: this merger, and how it plays out, will be one of the decade's most defining transportation stories.
2026 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Rendering Rear
I just spent the week driving a rented Tesla Model 3 Highland around Texas to see family over the holidays, and I was lamenting how the highest-range, most efficient EVs are always smaller cars and sedans—you know, the stuff Americans don't want to buy because we're so obsessed with big SUVs and trucks. But a trend that we've covered before has emerged even more clearly as the year wraps up: American buyers are starting to gravitate more to smaller vehicles now.
Above all, you can blame high prices for this change. Here's the Wall Street Journal:
Sales of some smaller, entry-level models, such as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, have taken off this year, rising 23% or more through November, according to research firm Motor Intelligence. Those increases have far outpaced the industry’s growth, which has been in the low single digits this year.
Meanwhile, large pickup truck sales, long a highly profitable corner of the market for the Detroit car companies, slid 1.9%, data from car-shopping website Edmunds shows. Sales of midsize SUVs, the type of vehicle typically favored by families, have also declined, falling 2.3% over 2023.
This rising interest in smaller offerings comes as owning a car has become increasingly unaffordable. The average selling price of a new car is still at historically high levels, exceeding $45,000 in November, according to J.D. Power. Insurance premiums, financing rates and repair costs have also climbed in recent years, further stretching household budgets.
As expenses have ticked higher, some buyers have become more willing to make a trade-off, sacrificing size and space for a lower monthly payment, analysts say.
“They need the functionality that the vehicle has, but they just need to buy the smaller size,” said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive. “It fits into their wallet.”
If you're a fan of smaller cars, there are some really positive signs here. The Mazda 3, which is objectively excellent (it's what I drive when I'm not in our Kia EV6) has seen double-digit sales gains this year. Compact and subcompact SUV sales are up 12% this year, as people still want that extra ride height and capability without going too large. And the Chevrolet Trax, which is finally a pretty good car and can be had in the $20,000 range, saw sales jump 89% in November alone.
So what does this mean for the electric market? I think it vindicates trends we've seen there as well: more buyers want affordable options and they're not interested in huge, luxury EVs with staggering price tags. It's why Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y hold the line so well, why the Chevy Equinox EV is doing so well and why there's so much hype around the new Chevy Bolt EUV due out next year.
People are sick of expensive cars after the pandemic sent everything into a tailspin. That should soon lead to a more attainable electric sector too, hopefully.
Elon Musk Dark Top
Meanwhile, in Washington, Congress has averted a government shutdown right before the holidays after passing a stopgap funding bill. But the U.S. came very close to that after Tesla CEO Elon Musk—who's now deeply involved with the incoming Trump Administration in a vague, unofficial capacity—stirred the pot on X to get lawmakers to kill it.
Why would Musk get so involved in this particular issue? Well, CNBC reports that House Democrats are accusing Musk of intervening to protect his Chinese interests, which could've been threatened if the original spending bill had been passed:
House Democrats Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut say their Republican colleagues in Congress caved to the demands of Elon Musk, sinking a bipartisan government funding bill that would have regulated U.S. investments in China.
The scrapped provision “would have made it easier to keep cutting-edge AI and quantum computing tech — as well as jobs — in America,” he wrote. “But Elon had a problem.”
Tesla, run by Musk, is the only foreign automaker to operate a factory in China without a local joint venture. Tesla also built a battery plant down the street from its Shanghai car factory this year, and aims to develop and sell self-driving vehicle technology in China.
“His bottom line depends on staying in China’s good graces,” McGovern wrote about Musk. “He wants to build an AI data center there too — which could endanger U.S. security. He’s been bending over backwards to ingratiate himself with Chinese leaders.”
Musk responded by calling DeLauro an ""awful creature"" on X. Anyway, we'll soon see how long Musk's relationship with Trump lasts if the CEO keeps taking the limelight from the incoming president. But as long as he does have influence in the new White House, expect it to be used accordingly.
VW XPeng
Toyota-Mazda-Subaru? Volkswagen-Xpeng-Rivian? General Motors acquires Jeep, Dodge and Ram from an ailing Stellantis? I don't think we've seen the last of Honda-Nissan-style power mergers. Where do you see this going next?

The 2025 Subaru Solterra Got A Big Price Cut,https://insideevs.com/news/745297/2025-subaru-solterra-ev-price-decrease/,"Subaru’s only electric model in the United States will be up to $7,000 less expensive starting next year.",2024-12-23 03:18:23,"The 2025 Subaru Solterra will be up to $7,000 less expensive than the outgoing model when it reaches dealerships in the United States early next year. It’s a significant price cut, but that’s about everything customers will get for the new model year, as there are precisely zero new features.
That said, the 2025 Solterra gets a new, top-of-the-line trim level called the Touring Onyx Edition, which comes with gloss black wheels and gloss black exterior and interior accents. This is the most expensive version of the Solterra, with an MSRP of $46,915 including destination.
On the other side of the list, there’s the 2025 Subaru Solterra Premium, which starts at $39,915, $6,500 less than the outgoing model. It comes as standard with dual-motor all-wheel drive, roof rails, 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels, an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone climate control and a pretty long list of advanced driver assistance features. These include Emergency Steering Assist, Lane Departure Prevention, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control and Hands-Free Low-Speed Driving.
More Stuff Like This
Next is the 2025 Solterra Limited, which retails for $43,415. Again, this gets a $6,500 cut compared to the 2024 model year. On top of what the Premium trim offers, the Limited comes with a 12.3-inch central infotainment display, a Harman Kardon audio system with 11 speakers, a 360-degree camera system, 20-inch allow wheels, 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat, 8-way power-adjustable passenger’s seat, heated rear seats, power rear liftgate, rain-sensing wipers, a wireless smartphone charger, a heated steering wheel and LED fog lights.
For $46,415, the 2025 Subaru Solterra Touring adds a panoramic glass roof with power sunshade, front and rear LED footwell lighting, heated and ventilated seats, a digital rearview mirror with Homelink and camera washer, as well as smart key access on all five doors. The 2025 Solterra Touring is $7,000 cheaper than the 2024 model year.
The list is completed by the Solterra Touring Onyx Edition–new for 2025–which costs $46,916 including destination. It adds a high-gloss black underguard, 20-inch wheels finished in black, black roof pillars, shoulder line trim, door frame, rear quarter window and roof spoiler, and black badging. Inside, black trim accents are installed on the front and rear doors, as well as on the seat upholstery.
The Solterra's EPA range rating and charging specs remain unchanged. Subaru's sole EV can go up to 227 miles on a full charge, and recharging it from 10% to 80% state of charge on a DC fast charger takes 35 minutes. The maximum DC charging speed is 100 kilowatts.
The Subaru Solterra is based on the Toyota bZ4X, which also got a significant price cut in the U.S. for the 2025 model year. Both are built in the same Toyota factory in Japan.",Iulian Dnistran
This Tesla Plaid-Powered Cobra Is Absurdly Quick,https://insideevs.com/news/745270/cobra-tesla-plaid-ev-conversion/,"With over 1,000 horsepower, all-wheel drive and about 1,450 fewer pounds to lug around, this thing is a rocket.",2024-12-22 14:00:05,"While there are many EV conversions that feature Tesla drive units and battery modules, there are hardly any that feature the bonkers three-motor Plaid powertrain with 1,060 horsepower. This lengthened and widened Cobra kit car is one of them, and it’s pretty bonkers.
The car needed to be bigger to fit the 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack out of a Model S Plaid and its three motors. You can see how much metal was added since it’s not painted, and the car looks about two feet longer than standard as well as about 10 inches wider. The longer wheelbase and wider track should also help improve comfort, stability at high speeds and the predictability of the handling while driving the car spiritedly.
It has Plaid front and rear subframes, so the wheels still stick out even though the body has been widened. The wheelbase appears to be a bit shorter than a Model S Plaid’s.
The vehicle was built by Don Swadley, who used a special custom controller created by Ingenext that makes the powertrain work. The result is impressive and, frankly, a bit scary too. We’d love to see this on a drag strip to see how it compares with the world’s quickest-accelerating vehicles.
Weighing around 3,300 pounds, it’s considerably lighter than a Model S Plaid, which weighs nearly 4,800 pounds. That’s an almost 1,500-pound difference, which explains why the acceleration looks so scary in the driving video posted by Revolt Systems. It shows the car not only accelerating from a standstill and pinning the occupants to their seats even under partial throttle but also how all four tires lose traction even when you floor it at higher speeds.
This Cobra is lighter and should, therefore, be even quicker than the Dodge Challenger Hellcat Plaid swap we featured last month.
The car has fully slick tires, whose grip on an unprepared surface and, when not up to temperature, can vary greatly. Even with all-wheel drive and sticky tires, though, this is still a pretty scary EV conversion, although if you take it to a drag strip with a grippier surface, it should catapult itself off the line and easily beat a Model S Plaid.

Production Of Fiat And Maserati EVs Will Stay Paused Over Slow Sales,https://www.motor1.com/news/745181/stellantis-pauses-maserati-fiat-production-again/,"Stellantis is extending the Fiat 500e production stoppage until January 20, while Maserati EV production is paused until February 3.",2024-12-25 01:24:52,"Fiat won’t be building any new 500es anytime soon. Stellantis has extended the shutdown at the factory where it assembles the little electric vehicle until January 20. The automaker had announced late last month that it would pause production at its Mirafiori factory in Italy until January 5.
The new extended shutdown also includes the Maserati GranTurismo and GrabCabrio that Stellantis also builds at the plant. However, according to the Reuters report, the automaker won’t restart producing those two models until February 3.
Stellantis has paused production at the factory before, including twice late last year in September and again in October. Electric vehicles just aren't selling as well as automakers had planned, and automakers are now curtailing EV production while reconsidering their electrification efforts.
CEO Carlos Tavares had previously blamed bad marketing for Maserati’s woes, but Stellantis has since parted ways with the CEO. There was disagreement between Tavares and the board about the automaker’s direction, leading to his sudden resignation at the beginning of the month.
Interestingly, abysmal EV sales have been a boon for consumers looking for cheap leases. Falling demand is leaving dealers with a lot of inventory they’re eager to move. One dealer in Colorado is currently offering a $0-a-month lease on the new 500e, leaning generous federal and state incentives to give consumers excellent deals.

Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,2024-12-25 01:24:52,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

"Tesla Wanted $3,000 To Fix A Dented Cybertruck. The Owner Fixed It For $25",https://insideevs.com/news/744851/tesla-cybertruck-diy-dent-removal-video/,Being resourceful has its advantages.,2024-12-21 10:00:05,"The Tesla Cybertruck is advertised as being dent-proof, rust-proof and even bulletproof. It all sounds very good, and it’s some very good marketing on Tesla’s side, but it’s not exactly true, as some owners found out the hard way. (Please don’t shoot your own car.)
That said, there are benefits to owning an unpainted car that’s covered in stainless steel panels, as one Cybertruck owner from Detroit found out after another vehicle dented the driver-side door of his electric pickup just a few weeks after getting delivery.
The ding was on the lower part of the door on the factory crease that extends to the rear wheels. Naturally, this being a brand-new car, the owner went to a Tesla collision center to get a quote for the repair. The estimate was a pretty hefty $3,000, with $828 for a new door panel and the rest in labor.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Unfazed by the potential repair costs, the owner went home and tried to fix the ding with the help of a friend. The first attempt was with a sturdy suction cup, but it wouldn’t stay attached to the body panel and the dent was still there.
The next step was to heat the steel panel and then stick some glue sticks on the damaged area. The sticks were simply pulled by hand. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t work either.
However, a second try with the suction cup on a warm panel resulted in a definite fix, which was very satisfying to watch, as you can see in the video embedded above. The “pop” of the metal returning to its original form is nothing but bliss for people who like working on their own cars (this news writer included).
The cost? Chump change compared to the Tesla collision center estimate: a $25 lunch for the owner’s buddy who did all the work.",Iulian Dnistran
Electric Car Charging Etiquette Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/745023/electric-car-ev-charging-etiquette/,InsideEVs has compiled five key tips to make sure all EV drivers have hassle-free charging sessions.,2024-12-20 13:30:33,"Electric cars are rapidly taking over the streets. Recently, you might have passed a Tesla Model Y cruising down the highway or seen a family unloading their gear from a Honda Prologue by the soccer field. They're everywhere. But there is one significant effect: more cars than ever need to get plugged in.
If you've charged in a busy urban area, you might have encountered full or over-capacity chargers. This means that drivers must be familiar with the proper etiquette to ensure swift and courteous charging sessions. Like the rules of the road, there are rules to charging. InsideEVs has compiled five key tips to make sure all EV drivers have hassle-free charging sessions.
More On Charging
The cardinal rule of charging an electric car on a public charger is to plug in. This rule applies to all chargers, but primarily level 2 stations at work, hotels, or shopping centers. Namely, if you're in a charging spot, plug in. If your car is at a high enough state of charge where it doesn't need to be plugged in, then you should find a regular parking spot.
The charging spots are there for vehicles to charge, not for people's cars to occupy. 'ICE'ing' is a term used to describe an internal combustion engine-powered car that is intentionally parked in an EV spot. It's annoying and inconsiderate when this happens. But in the case of an EV not plugging in, it's the exact same scenario. There's a vehicle blocking other people's access to the charger.
With the influx of EVs on the road, charging spots are more likely to be occupied. And some people rely on these chargers for their daily travels. Therefore, if you see an open charging spot and need a charge, plug in!
As an extension of the first rule, you should always leave a charging spot once a session is complete. When your car has completed charging, the spot should be vacated to allow others to charge. Especially at hotels, many EV drivers have likely planned their trip to account for an overnight charging stop. Therefore, if your car is done charging at ten at night, the courteous thing to do would be to unplug and find a different spot.
Most DC fast charging stations have idle fees, meaning you will receive a bill if your car is done charging and still plugged in. Tesla charges an idle fee of up to $1.00 a minute, depending on station business. Therefore, if your car has completed its charging session, it's time to find somewhere else to park.
While every electric car on the market features different charging profiles, generally, they charge faster at lower states of charge. This means that when road-tripping, it is sometimes more time-efficient to ""bottom charge"" your car. For instance, the Model Y takes around 33 minutes to charge from 10 to 80 percent. But it takes 30 more minutes to go from 80 to 100. In other words, if the next charging stop isn't far away, it's not worth waiting to ""top charge"" the battery.
Some drivers have EVs that come with free charging subscriptions. BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen (not anymore), and Hyundai are a few automakers that supply their electric cars with unlimited 30-minute charging sessions on Electrify America. While free charging is undoubtedly a perk, some drivers like to fully maximize the offer by charging from, say, 60 to 100% while they're shopping.
While there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of an offer, one should be cognizant of others in line. If you're road-tripping, pulling in at 10 percent, and waiting for an ID.4 to reach 100%, you may not be a happy camper.
While Tesla opening up the Supercharging network to other makes and models is a big deal, there's one big caveat. A lot of EVs on the market have their charge ports in different locations. All Ford and most GM EVs feature charging ports on the driver's side front quarter panel. Meanwhile, BMW's electric cars bestow their ports on the passenger side rear.
On the other hand, Tesla's lineup has the charging port positioned on the driver's side rear. Since Tesla developed the charger and vehicle simultaneously, the engineers designed the cable to be just long enough to accommodate the port location. Shorter cables mean less coolant is needed, lessened electrical resistance, and a smaller bill of materials (particularly less copper).
Tesla Ford NACS Supercharger Double Park
Depending on the station design, shorter cables might have trouble reaching all cars. Pull-through Superchargers should pose no serious issues, though the traditional parking-space style ones might. To charge a Chevrolet Equinox EV on a Supercharger, occupying more than one spot might be necessary.
Simply put, if you're in a busy region, taking up multiple supercharging spots might block another driver's access to a stall. Tesla recommends not parking perpendicular to the spot lines, as that would block three stalls. Instead, drivers must straddle the dividing lines for the front charge port to come close enough to the cable. End spots are obviously the most desirable, though taking up two spots is the temporary solution for now.
Tesla's 4th generation Superchargers will have longer cables, so this issue is isolated with previous generation stations.
Unfortunately, queuing at charging stations is a bit of an issue. If you arrive at a full charging station in a busy spot, the best method is to park in a spot opposite the stalls. Therefore, you can see the cars entering and exiting. If there isn't a lot of parking lot traffic and it's safe, then it's usually all right to park in the lot facing the chargers. This way, other arriving drivers know that you were there first.
Finally, once you've been queuing and get on a charger, it's recommended not to stay at the station unnecessarily long. If there's a long line, and the next charger on your trip is less busy, you should charge as much as you need to get there with a buffer. This will help get people in and out of the station and on their way.
The electric car community is rapidly evolving, with more members than ever. However, proper etiquette is needed to ensure everyone can get to their destinations quickly and seamlessly. This means that drivers must be conscious of their time at stations.
But the best way is education. If you meet a new driver at a station, tell him or her about how charging works. Let that person know about the different types of charging stations or what charging curves are. Driving electric demands a learning curve, so keeping other drivers up to speed is good for everyone.",Andrew Lambrecht
'It’s A Desperate Move': Ex-Nissan Boss Carlos Ghosn On Honda Merger,https://insideevs.com/news/745166/carlos-ghosn-honda-nissan-cm/,"The former Nissan-Renault chief isn't staying quiet about the former's potential merger with Honda. Plus: a Tesla recall, and Cybercabs in Austin?",2024-12-20 10:04:39,"Carlos Ghosn was never one to pull his punches. Even at the peak of his power at the helm of one of the world's largest automakers, he always had a lot to say. So following his daring escape from Japanese prosecution for alleged financial crimes, nobody should have expected the former Nissan-Renault boss in exile to just chill on a yacht somewhere. (Well, he had one, but he had to give it back.)
Now, Ghosn is back in the public eye to weigh in on Nissan's potential merger with Honda, and he hasn't lost his fiery touch. That kicks off this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and tech news. Also on tap: a Tesla recall that you should know about (but one of the over-the-air sort,) and possible news about a Tesla Cybercab deployment in Austin. Let's dig in.
You may not care what Ghosn has to say about Nissan—or anything—anymore, especially since he hasn't been involved with the automaker since his 2018 arrest in Japan and subsequent flight from prosecution about a year after that. But I'd argue few people on earth know Nissan like Ghosn does. And few people know about mergers to save Nissan like Ghosn does.
After all, Ghosn was a top executive at Renault in 1999 when it formed the Nissan-Renault Alliance, an odd cross-continental team-up that rescued Nissan was on the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan's problems back then should sound familiar: an unsustainable focus on volume, forgettable models, a hangover from a financial crisis, and so on. He would soon lead both companies to a surprising degree of financial and sales success until his downfall.
Now, Nissan is in crisis again. It's the poster child for how far behind the Japanese auto industry is technologically, and for how much ground it's losing to new, high-tech players in China. Japan Inc. needs capital and expertise to deliver a future focused on batteries and software, and Honda—despite being in much better shape these days—has been called up on to help make that happen. Merger talks could start as soon as Monday, according to reports.
But Ghosn told Bloomberg he doesn't see the point:
“It’s a desperate move,” Ghosn said Friday on Bloomberg Television. “It’s not a pragmatic deal because frankly, the synergies between the two companies are difficult to find.”
Nissan and Honda operate in the same markets with similar brands and products, Ghosn said, casting doubt on the merits of the two combining. He believes Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has pushed Honda to go forward with a deal.
“They’re trying to figure out something that could marry the short-term problems of Nissan and the long-term vision of Honda,” Ghosn said. While there is “no industrial logic” to a deal, “there is a moment where you have to choose between performance and control.”
It's also worth noting here that Ghosn is hardly some benevolent, unbiased actor. He has maintained both his innocence and a huge axe to grind against Nissan since his departure, and has spent the years since railing against the automaker's management and failures in the marketplace.
But he's right that synergies are hard to find here—in Nissan and Renault's case, the alliance was a tight partnership between two giants that often operated in very different markets and wasn't an outright merger. (Neither Japan nor the French government, which partially owns Renault, ever seemed good with that.) But Honda and Nissan are direct competitors basically everywhere and in every segment. How does this make sense for Honda, in particular?
Ghosn also addressed the reports that this merger was prompted by interest in Nissan from Taiwanese electronics giant (and iPhone manufacturer) Foxconn, which has wanted to get into the carmaking game for some time. The current thinking by many industry watchers is the Japanese government is moving this along to protect some of its most important companies from foreign control. But Ghosn warned Foxconn will be back, somewhere:
“I can understand that a company like Foxconn — headed by very serious and realistic management — is going to say, ‘You know what, instead of us investing to do our own electric car, let’s buy a car company,” Ghosn said. “They’re not going to be the only one to try to do that.”
We'll know more as this reportedly starts to play out next week.
Tesla Model Y Tire
Hey, Tesla owners: you may own one of the 700,000 models affected by a new recall. Luckily, this one's an over-the-air update. Here's what to know from the Associated Press:
According to a letter Thursday from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall includes certain 2024 Cybertruck, 2017-2025 Model 3, and 2020-2025 Model Y vehicles.
The issue is that the tire pressure monitoring system warning light on the vehicles may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure. Driving with improperly inflated tires can increase the risk of a crash.
Are OTA updates ""recalls""? I say if they fix a problem, I have no issue with that phrasing.
Tesla Cybercab, LA Auto Show 2024
It's not uncommon to see Google's Waymo driverless cars zooming around tech-crazed Austin these days. But if Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets his way, Austin could eventually see Tesla Cybercabs on its roads too. Here's one more from Bloomberg:
Emails acquired by Bloomberg through public records requests show a Tesla employee has been communicating with the city of Austin’s autonomous vehicle task force since at least May to establish safety expectations for the vehicles as the company decides if Austin will be the first Texas city where Tesla deploys driverless fleets.
“Tesla is still working to strategically find a city within Texas to deploy... The city of Austin is obviously on our roadmap, but has not yet been decided where we will deploy first as we have many options available,” a November email from the employee said.
A successful rollout is key to Tesla as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has increasingly bet the company’s future on autonomous technology and robotaxis, but the needed approvals could be years away. A number of competitors have already deployed driverless cars on public roads in select cities.
But Austin's own mayor has been a critic of the technology too, and as the story notes, Texas isn't necessarily the regulatory free-for-all that you might expect it to be:
In Texas, where autonomous vehicles are regulated much like any other car and cities do not set regulations, Tesla will face few regulatory hurdles. Companies must have insurance, be able to follow traffic laws and be equipped with video recording devices. Robotaxis must have their own licensing, and the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation has yet to list Tesla as a licensee.
Still, testing the Cybercabs—which will controversially rely on cameras and AI instead of Lidar and other advanced sensor suites like Waymo's cars—in the warm-weather home of Tesla makes a lot of sense for the company. I would not be shocked at all if testing begins there as early as next year.

Porsche Is Struggling With Electric 718 Boxster Development: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/744790/porsche-718-electric-development-problems/,Battery issues could delay the next Cayman as well.,2024-12-25 01:24:54,"Already discontinued in Europe because of cybersecurity regulations, the current-generation Porsche 718 is not long for this world. The gasoline-fueled Boxster and Cayman duo will be discontinued globally by next year. What comes after? An all-electric sports car. However, there's reportedly a possibility of a gap between when the ICE dies and when the EV indirectly takes its place in the lineup.
Automobilwoche, the German branch of Automotive News Europe, claims Porsche is having problems developing the 718 EV. The engineers from Zuffenhausen are apparently ""well behind schedule,"" so there's a real risk the electric sports car's launch could be delayed. The mid-mounted battery is believed to be the culprit, with Porsche ""constantly requesting adjustments"" from supplier Valmet Automotive.
The Finnish company is doing as asked, but it's incurring additional costs that Porsche allegedly doesn't want to pay or only partially covers. Based on our oldest spy shots, the electric 718 has been undergoing testing for at least two years. Nevertheless, it's increasingly likely that the Boxster and Cayman without a combustion engine will not be ready for primetime in 2025 to supersede the gas cars swiftly.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg. According to Automobilwoche, the next-gen, electric-only Cayenne could also be delayed from its original programmed debut in 2026. Porsche has already stopped chasing its lofty goal of having EVs account for 80% of annual sales by 2030. In addition, the German luxury brand has pledged to keep the V-8 engine well into the next decade.
The report mentions that the Panamera could get a next-generation model with combustion engines, given the company's current slowdown in electric sales. Taycan deliveries were down 50% globally through September. On a more positive note, the 911 is said to continue with gas engines into the 2030s. On numerous occasions, Porsche has said the 911 will be its final ICE car.
Elsewhere, the large electric SUV known internally as the ""K1"" could be pushed back by a few years. Alternatively, Porsche is reportedly considering extending the Cayenne's platform for a three-row SUV with gas engines since the Volkswagen Group Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) doesn't support conventional powertrains. Last month, the Chief Financial Officer, Lutz Meschke, admitted that future models that were supposed to be electric-only could get gas engines:
""We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""
Porsche is in a delicate situation. The next-gen Macan was supposed to be released about two years ago, but software glitches prevented the electric crossover from being released on time. It's now finally out. To make matters worse, the ICE version—which has always been among the firm's top sellers—will be phased out worldwide in 2026. It has already been axed in Europe due to the same cybersecurity regulations that killed the 718.
As if that wasn't bad enough, demand in China has collapsed this year, with deliveries falling by nearly 30% in the first nine months.
We've reached out for a comment from Porsche. The article will be updated if we hear back.

Tesla Sales Are Tanking In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/745119/tesla-sales-europe-2024/,"Eleven months into 2024, Tesla is seeing a double-digit decrease in registrations.",2024-12-20 04:15:37,"Europe is experiencing some weird times. From politics to economy and car sales, it’s far from rosy, and arguably the biggest player in the electric vehicle game is having a rough year.
Eleven months into 2024, Tesla recorded a double-digit decrease in registrations, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which released official figures for November.
To be clear, Tesla is still one of the largest EV manufacturers in Europe and the United States, but its grip is weakening on the other side of the Atlantic. Last month, Tesla recorded a 40.9% decrease in registrations in the European Union compared to the same month last year. The number of registrations went from 31,810 in November 2023 to 18,786 last month, marking a decrease in market share from 3.6% to 2.2%.
More Sales Stories
Year-to-date, Tesla had 211,405 registrations in the EU, 15.2% fewer than last year’s 249,265 units.
It’s a similar story when the European Free Trade Association members and the United Kingdom are included in the mix. EFTA members include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On these markets, Tesla registrations went down 28.4% in November, from 36,563 units last year to 26,191 units this year, which made the American automaker’s market share go down from 3.4% to 2.5%.
Year-to-date, Tesla registrations in the EU, EFTA and UK went down 13.7% from 327,635 units in 2023 to 282,692 units this year, while the market share shrunk from 2.8% to 2.4%. In the EU alone, which has 27 member states, Tesla’s market share went down from 2.6% in the first 11 months of last year to 2.2% this year.
The automaker’s losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasingly controversial attitude of its CEO, Elon Musk, and the decrease in government incentives. Some European states have reduced the amount of money offered toward the purchase of a new EV, while others have eliminated the incentives altogether.
That said, Tesla’s significant drop in European registrations has largely left the EV industry unaffected. Considering the sheer volume of electric cars sold by Tesla, EV registrations as a whole only went down by 1.4% in the EU, EFTA and UK from January to November and they actually went up 0.9% in November compared to last year. In the EU alone, EV registrations went down 5.4% year-to-date and 9.5% in November.
This can only mean one thing: other automakers have stepped up to try and fill the gap left by Tesla, and customers are following suit.",Iulian Dnistran
"Rivian Has Delivered Over 20,000 Electric Vans To Amazon So Far",https://insideevs.com/news/745106/rivian-amazon-edv-delivery-update/,Amazon’s Rivian EDV fleet in the U.S. has increased by roughly 33% in four months.,2024-12-20 03:17:02,"American e-commerce giant Amazon now has over 20,000 Rivian Electric Delivery Vans (EDVs) making deliveries across the United States. This year, the American-made commercial EVs have delivered over one billion packages for Amazon.
The previous fleet update came at the beginning of August when Amazon said Rivian had delivered 15,000 EDVs. At the end of November, the e-commerce giant said its Rivian commercial van fleet has expanded to over 20,000 units, but many more are yet to come.
Amazon and Rivian struck a deal in 2019 to put 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road by 2030. The first Amazon-branded EVs were delivered in the summer of 2022. In other words, roughly two and a half years were needed to produce 20,000 units, which comes out to approximately 700 units per month.
More Rivian Van Stuff
With five years left until the 2030 deadline, Rivian has a good shot at reaching its target if it keeps up the same production pace. In a previous email sent to InsideEVs, the company said it remains on track to deliver on its EDV commitments.
Roughly 300 Rivian-made Amazon Electric Delivery Vans were sent to Germany, but the vast majority are shipping parcels in the United States in cities like Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Portland, San Diego and Seattle.
To keep the huge fleet of electric vans running, Amazon has installed over 17,000 chargers at more than 120 delivery centers throughout the country, making it the largest private charging operator in the world.
The Rivian-made electric commercial vehicle was designed exclusively for Amazon, but the exclusivity deal was shuttered last year when Rivian said anyone could buy its now-renamed Commercial Van or RCV. AT&T has a pilot program where it’s testing several RCVs and R1 EVs, and Canada Post has commissioned several custom-made delivery vans known as the Morgan Olson C250e, which is based on the Rivian ECV.",Iulian Dnistran

They will be replaced by flexible-powertrain two- and four-door models, both called Charger, that will be motivated, at launch in early 2025, solely by a 100.5 kWh battery pack and a pair of electric motors. (And if you’re a Mopar nut but are committed to internal combustion, your muscle-car future means an inline-six engine, as if you were one of those guys whose entire wardrobe consists of ///M apparel. Can you imagine?) So how does Mopar’s methylized muscle-maker plan to convince potential consumers to buy into such a blasphemous switcheroo?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To get enthusiasts’ “butts-in-seats” and assist with this electron baptism, Dodge is planning a whole series of events in the upcoming year, said Matt McAlear, the brand’s CEO. It will take its new EV muscle cars on tour in the first quarter of 2025 to train its sales and dealership staff and demonstrate the vehicles’ capabilities. It is launching a courtesy transportation program wherein it will send EVs to dealers to use for short-term consumer test drives, or as 96-hour loaners when customers come in to have their vehicle serviced. It will host consumer-facing “Thrill Ride” drive events at upcoming Mecum and Barrett-Jackson classic car auctions, and at its drifting/drag racing “Roadkill Nights” live events in the summer–—prime sites for the gathering of Hemis of all vintages.
“Dodge is always best as a brand when it does something different,” McAlear said, referencing the automaker’s marketing slogan from the 1980s and 1990s, Dodge Different. And he’s certainly right about convincing people with actual seat time and not just ads. Study after study indicates that once people experience EVs for themselves, or hear from friends and family who do, they’re far more likely to pull the trigger themselves.
Plus, he said, this EV has the bona fides. “This vehicle, it's a muscle car first. If you look at the specs, the design, the capability, and take powertrain out of it, it’s a better muscle car on paper than the cars it replaces,” he noted. “So while there is a polarizing, controversial aspect to this—that it happens to have an EV powertrain as one of the powertrains that’s going to power it—no one can argue the battery electric technology enables terrific performance, and that's what we're bringing to market with this.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To enunciate this point, McAlear pointed out that even after Dodge introduces ICE-powered iterations of the Charger in the second half of 2025, gasoline power will represent “the entry-level vehicles from a performance standpoint.” So if a potential consumer desires a car with the quickest acceleration (0-60 in 3.3 seconds) they’ll learn that that capability is a battery-only option.
This powertrain rollout and hierarchy is a stated part of Dodge’s strategy for muscling the muscle car faithful toward EVs, according to McAlear. Another prong in this program is to focus on added utility and daily drivability, to create what Stellantis design chief Ralph Gilles called “emotional alibis” to lead consumers toward acceptance of this new product.
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear listed a suite of capabilities that can provide such cover for what amounts to a highly irrational and emotional purchase. “All-wheel-drive, for instance, helps us compete more in the North as a daily driver,” he said, referencing its all-weather capability. “A hidden hatchback capability gives you amazing cargo space that you didn’t have in your old vehicle. The new Charger two-door now has more rear-seat legroom than the outgoing four-door,” he said. “So this becomes much more of a daily driver than any of the muscle cars that we've had prior.”
Will this litany of added functionality convince Dodge die-hards, who will receive a defeatable synthetic exhaust note that is as boisterous as that of the outgoing car, but no scent of unburned fuel or ability to smoke the rear tires from a standstill?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
“Probably not immediately out of the gate,” McAlear said. “It's going to take some time. It's going to take them seeing one on the street. It's going to take them going in for service and testing one while they're getting an oil change. But I've seen those people get behind the wheel and come out with changed opinions.”
However, convincing the faithful may not be the ideal tactic for furthering this car’s market penetration. “Though a muscle car and an electric vehicle seem diametrically opposed, there is an opportunity for electrification to magnify the idea, benefits, and aspirational nature of the muscle car,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a Southern California automotive research and consulting firm. “However, the conversion of those from the past, I do not believe is the best strategy. Instead, a new generation of muscle cars can find success with younger folks who think they like muscle cars.”
As it turns out, Dodge has just such consumers in its targets. “If you look at our current demographic today, we have the youngest demographic in the mainstream auto industry,” said McAlear. “We have the highest percentage of Gen Z and Millennials. And those customers have the highest propensity to be willing to adopt electrification. So that sets us up.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Dodge might be onto something here. Though muscle car seems like an anachronistic category to anyone who isn’t a Boomer, research shows that these vehicles have and maintain broader appeal. “The interesting thing with those cars, I think, is they’re far more long-lived than cars like tri-five [1955-57] Chevys, or other American cars of the era,” said Brian Rabold, vice president of valuation for Hagerty, the world’s largest insurer of collectible vehicles. “There are a lot more entry points for younger generations to become interested in them—through driving video games, through movies like the Fast and Furious franchise.” As Rabold notes, pop cultural exposure conjures interest and desire, and translates into purchases, whether those be old Polaras and Road Runners, or more recent Fox Body Mustangs and fourth-gen Firebirds.
Still, rumors have persisted that interest in Dodge’s new muscular EV is less robust than the brand initially suspected and that it is thus rushing the inline-six-powered iterations to supplement this engagement. McAlear denies this categorically.
“That's what you call an urban legend,” he said. “Someone put one thing on the Internet. And if it's on the Internet, it's true, right?” He laughed, underlining his sarcasm. “We're always trying to bring every new vehicle to market as quickly as possible,” he continued. “It doesn't do us any good from an R&D and a capital expenditure standpoint to hold sales any longer than we have to. So nothing has changed with our timing.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Overall, once both powertrains are on the market, McAlear expects the mix of Charger buyers to segment about evenly: half electric, half gas. This aligns with Dodge’s current mix of high-test Hemi- versus lesser-powered Challengers and Chargers. “If we look historically at our V6 versus our performance V8, it was roughly 50/50,” McAlear said. “So I still think there's an opportunity, over time—as adoption continues to happen, and as infrastructure comes in across the U.S. in terms of charging capability—I think there's the ability for this [EV] to beat a 50/50 mix.” (Dodge officials declined to address questions about demand or pre-orders, but said they plan to remain flexible in terms of production based on consumer demand.)
If any marque is positioned to succeed with an electric muscle car, it seems to be Mopar’s performance brand. “Consumers who own the Charger and Challenger usually love their vehicles,” said Edwards, whose firm conducts hundreds of thousands of in-depth psychographic surveys with new car buyers annually. “Even those who never buy a Dodge can often agree that Dodge is an exciting brand that has a lot to offer. If Dodge takes the position that they are innovating excitement, then this next step could be a doorway for Dodge’s electric future.” He added one further provision. “They just have to get the messaging right.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear and his teams seem to be thinking about this carefully, calibrating their messaging to entice purchasers who may be simultaneously powertrain-aware and -agnostic. “People buy a muscle car for so much more than just what powers it. They buy it because of how it makes them feel. It's an extension of their personality. It puts a smile on their face. They have fun being in it. They have fun being seen it,” he said. “So I think that's what this vehicle does. And it opens this up to a much larger demographic and audience.”
After spending some time in the Daytona Charger EV, recently, I felt like it succeeded in charting a freshly charged path into the moribund world of muscle cars. So Dodge seemingly has the product right. And it has a history of creating memorable messaging.
We’ll see if it can find a magic recipe that yields results from a youthful audience open to this surprisingly compelling and venerable category.

MG Says Its 2025 Semi-Solid-State EV Won’t Break The Bank,https://insideevs.com/news/745068/mg-semi-solid-state-ev/,2025 is shaping up to be a big year for solid-state batteries in EVs and SAIC-owned MG wants to be at the forefront.,2024-12-19 16:00:16,"Solid-state batteries are a big buzzword on the electric vehicle scene these days because they promise to address many of the downsides of today’s EVs. Several automakers and specialized battery companies are working to make this groundbreaking technology financially viable for electric vehicles. Still, before true solid-state batteries reach a production car, we will likely first see semi-solid-state batteries implemented.
One automaker that plans to introduce a semi-solid-state is MG, according to CarNewsChina, which quotes local media sources. It says its new semi-solid-state model will offer great range and excellent charging performance. Semi-solid-state batteries are halfway between regular lithium-ion and solid-state batteries that do away with the former’s liquid or gel electrolyte in favor of a solid-state material.
China’s SAIC now owns MG and it makes all its cars in China. It plans to launch the new EV in 2025 and says the semi-solid state battery won’t raise the vehicle’s price. It will come standard and likely related to (or the same as) the pack in another SAIC-owned brand, IM Motors, which unveiled its semi-solid-state sedan earlier this year.
The IM L6 has a 133-kilowatt-hour semi-solid-state battery pack, giving it a claimed CLTC range of over 1,000 kilometers (623 miles). It’s built on an 800-volt platform and its maker says it can charge at 400 kilowatts, adding 400 km (249 miles) of range in 12 minutes.
However, unlike the IM L6, which gets the semi-solid-state battery as an option in the highest trim (you can also get it with two cheaper NMC packs), the MG derivative will be semi-solid-state-only. The L6 with the mid-tier NMC battery costs the equivalent of around $41,500, while the top “Lightyear Max” trim with the special battery costs $45,650.
More On This
This gives us an idea of what MG could charge for its semi-solid-state EV. If it’s competitively priced to compete with rivals from Volkswagen, Hyundai or Tesla but offers more range and faster charging, it could prove very successful. MG is already doing great in Europe thanks to the MG4 EV, a VW ID.3 rival offering more performance at a very attractive price.
However, people may be wary of buying a vehicle with battery technology whose durability and longevity have not been proven, although the financial proposition will also play a determining role. The new electric MG will be revealed in the first part of 2025 and will go on sale before the end of the year.",Andrei Nedelea
"Chevy Equinox EV: How To Get One Under $30,000",https://insideevs.com/news/745048/chevy-equinox-ev-lt-deals/,"Considering the incentives that both dealers and GM are offering, the Equinox EV is incredibly affordable.",2024-12-19 14:00:00,"The Chevrolet Equinox EV is a very important electric car. It’s so important that InsideEVs has chosen it as our inaugural “Breakthrough EV Of The Year.” While the electric Equinox offers sleek styling and impressive range, its best attribute is its price point.
Starting at $34,995 in base LT form, the Equinox EV offers what's probably the best range-to-price ratio in the entire industry right now. For example,  the Equinox EV undercuts the Volkswagen ID.4’s $41,160 sticker price by $6,165. Yet, the Equinox can travel 113 additional EPA-rated miles. Add in the EV tax credit and the price drops as low as $27,495. But that’s not all.
2024 Chevy Equinox EV RS AWD
If you currently own or lease a 2010 or newer non-GM vehicle, you will be able to get an additional $1,500 off the purchase or lease of a new Equinox EV. Prospective owners who have a Costco membership are able to shave another $1,000 off the MSRP of the car. Since these offers can be stacked, a Costco member with, say, a 2018 Tesla Model 3 will pay just $24,995 for a new model.
But there are ways to get into an Equinox EV for even less. We’ve seen several U.S. dealerships advertising new 2025 Equinox EV LTs with steep discounts, like this one in Michigan selling a car for $29,040. Add in the tax credits and you’re potentially looking at a new, high-range EV for around $23,000 after taxes and dealer fees.
Now, you need to make sure the advertised offer is what the dealer is actually going to honor, but the point is that we’re seeing Equinox EVs at prices far lower than expected as 2024 winds to a close. (Additionally, the Equinox EV lineup was simplified for 2025, so the one you want for a cheap deal is the 2025 Equinox EV LT.)
There’s no doubt the Equinox EV is a compelling case on paper. But all this begs the question: with these ultra-low prices, is now the time to buy an electric Equinox?
The Chevrolet Equinox EV’s most impressive attribute is its range. All Equinox EV variants come with an 85.0 kilowatt-hour usable battery pack. The base front-wheel-drive version can travel 319 miles on a charge and the $40,295 all-wheel-drive can manage a respectable 307 miles. Our own Tom Moloughney recorded 303 miles of range at 70-mph in the front-drive version. The FWD model creates 213 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque. The AWD manages 288 horsepower and 333 pound-feet.
2024 Chevy Equinox EV RS AWD
While the power is okay, there’s one big limitation: the weight. The front motor Equinox EV weighs 4,923 pounds and the all-wheel-drive tips the scales at 5,073 pounds. This makes the Equinox EV one of the heaviest non-luxury electric crossovers on the road. The omnipresent Model Y, which manages 320 miles of range, weighs 4,154, a far cry from the Equinox EV. This weight takes a hit on performance. The FWD can accelerate to sixty in 8.0 seconds and the AWD can accomplish a more venerable 5.9 seconds.
Nevertheless, consumers purchasing an affordable electric crossover probably don’t care about performance and weight, but they do care about charging. The Equinox EV comes as standard with an 11.5-kilowatt (48 amp) onboard charger, allowing for a Level 2 charge time of just 7.5 hours. On the AWD RS trim, Chevrolet offers a $1,295 onboard charger that can accept 80 amps or 19.2 kilowatts. This drops the charge time to just 4.5 hours.
Chevrolet Equinox EV charging inlet
While it charges fast enough on a Level 2 plug, its DC fast charging capabilities are just okay. Tom recorded a 20 to 80% charge time of 34 minutes, which is not groundbreaking. For comparison, the Kia EV6 crossover can manage 20 to 80% in just 17 minutes, thanks to its incredibly high-voltage battery pack. It’s not bad, but doable—and miles better than the recently discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV.
When it comes to trims and options, the Equinox EV is one of the weirdest vehicles in Chevrolet’s lineup. The base LT version comes low on features, what you’d expect for a car with a low price point. The entry-level Equinox offers a light dusting of features including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, a 17.7-inch display, cloth seats, and a six-speaker sound system. But the option packages get a bit confusing.
Equinox EV LT Interior
GM offers a $1,455 Comfort Package and a $545 Active Safety Package, though these must be added together. Therefore, the $2,000 combined package comes with a 360-degree camera, traffic sign recognition, heated front seats, a power driver's seat, and a heated leather steering wheel. But then there's an $8,300 Convenience Package. It comes with ambient lighting, trailer hitch guidance, auto-dimming mirrors, a wireless phone charger, a power liftgate, and a front LED lightbar.
Even more odd is the $11,400 Convenience Package II, which comes with 21-inch wheels, dual zone climate controls, a head-up display, heated rear seats, venilated front leatherette seats, and memory seat functionality. Drivers can choose either the Convenience I or II package. Nevertheless, the Convenience Package II costs a staggering 33.9% of the car’s MSRP. Supercruise hardware is available for $3,355 with 3 years included.
Equinox EV LT Interior
The more pricey RS version comes with additional features, as you’d expect. It features sporty 21-inch black wheels, ambient lighting, leatherette seating material, heated and powered front seats, wireless phone charging, and auto-dimming mirrors. The Convenience Package II is available, though it starts at a more digestible $3,095. It comes with ventilated front seats, a head-up display, dual-zone climate control, and a digital rearview mirror.
One thing to note is that the higher-end Equinox EV variants are often the ones that dealers add more incentives to.
The Equinox EV is not the perfect electric car, but it comes pretty close, all things considered. It doesn’t have the best charging capabilities and it won’t knock your socks off, but it’s a solid crossover with an even better starting price.
Considering the incentives that both dealers and GM are offering, the Equinox EV is incredibly affordable. It undercuts just about every other crossover on the market, gasoline or electric, all while offering over 300 miles of range.
Chevy Equinox EV LT
We recommend the base version as it is the same vehicle, just with fewer options. Instead of adding on $10,000 to $15,000 in options, it’s better to just buy a more premium vehicle, like a Tesla Model Y or a mid-level Kia EV6. Those offer better performance, driving dynamics, charging speeds and other features.
Even at $34,995 with no incentives, the Equinox EV is an excellent deal. But for prices encroaching upon the $23,000 mark, there is simply no reason for interested buyers not to buy one.

Nissan Leaf: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/745015/nissan-leaf-used-buying-guide/,"If you’re looking to get from A to a reasonably distanced point B on a budget, a used Nissan Leaf could be an intriguing option.",2024-12-19 13:00:29,"The Nissan Leaf was the first mass-produced electric vehicle. It set the paradigm for the early adopter EV, providing anemic power with minimal range and looking like a bug-eyed space capsule. It perfectly suited the core EV buyer in 2010: someone who felt the Toyota Prius was not quirky or hardcore enough.
Competitors surpassed the Leaf. Tesla proved EVs could be cool and offer more than three times as much range as the Leaf. Chevrolet built the more fully baked Bolt EV. And the market now has a robust segment of entry-level electric crossovers. But Nissan has kept updating the Leaf. And the brand has clung doggedly to its main virtue against the competition: affordability.
The Nissan Leaf S is America’s cheapest EV in production, with a starting MSRP below $30,000. And if you’re looking to get from A to a reasonably distanced point B on a budget, a used Nissan Leaf could be an intriguing option.
If you’re in the market for a used Nissan Leaf, here are the questions you must ask (and potential pitfalls to avoid).
The main distinction between Nissan Leafs is generational. The first-gen Nissan Leaf (2011-17) was a pioneer. But it also put out 107 horsepower and offered a paltry 73 miles of EPA-estimated range with its 24 kWh battery pack. A larger 30 kWh pack added late in the model run bumped the range to 107 miles. Remember, those cars now deliver significantly less in range than they did then.
Nissan broadened the Leaf’s niche with the second generation (2018-present). The base 42 kWH battery now brings an EPA-estimated 149 miles of range. Nissan now offers the Leaf Plus, introduced in 2019, which bumps the power output to 215 hp and the EPA-estimated range to 212 miles with its 62 kWh battery.
Used Nissan Leafs have a broad price range. You get what you pay for. First-generation Leafs tend to be dramatically cheaper. Older first-gen models, often with high mileage and diminished range, can be found for below $5,000. Later first-gen models with the 30 kWh battery may cost between $5,000 and $10,000.
Second-gen Leafs tend to be priced higher, between $10,000 and $20,000, depending on the age, usage and whether it was a Plus model. A used Leaf Plus model of recent vintage might crack $20,000. Almost every used Nissan Leaf should be beneath the $25,000 threshold for the used EV tax credit.
Yes. All lithium-ion batteries lose capacity over time. That can be a particular concern for first-gen Nissan Leafs. These cars have been on the road for a decade or more, had relatively primitive battery tech, and were often used hard by their owners, who charged 100 percent frequently. A Leaf that began with 73 miles of range may top out in the 40s or 50s now.
Some pre-2015 Leafs suffered particularly bad degradation when exposed to extreme heat in climates like the American Southwest. Nissan used passive air cooling for the battery packs rather than liquid cooling, which many modern EVs use. Nissan introduced a more resilient 24 kWh “Lizard” battery in 2015.
Nissan LEAF fast charging (CHAdeMO) at EVgo station
Nissan sold differently configured Leafs. That can make a difference in how quickly the vehicle can charge. For Level 2 home charging, first-gen models came with a base 3.6 kW capacity and an optional upgrade to 6.6 kW. The latter now comes standard on second-generation Leafs. This rate is slower than the 11.4 kW home charging some EVs are capable of. But remember that the Leaf has a smaller battery.
Fast charging for a Leaf is relatively slow by modern EV standards. Leaf vehicles come with a 50 kW quick charge port. Leaf Plus models upgrade to a 100 kW high-output quick charge port. The Leaf uses the CHAdeMO plug for fast charging; it’s basically the only EV still using it. That leaves Leaf owners with comparatively few options for fast charging.
Early first-gen Nissan Leafs struggled with cabin heating demands, sapping the range in cold weather. Nissan added the option for a more efficient heat pump in 2013, listed on the Monroney as the “Hybrid Heater System.” It came on higher trims and as part of a cold weather package. Having that can help diminish winter range loss.
Testing has shown second-generation Leafs to be stouter than the original model in cold weather conditions. A 2019 Leaf outperformed several competitors, maintaining its range in cold weather.
Yes. However, make sure to read the fine print. Nissan typically sold Leafs with a three-year or 36,000-mile comprehensive warranty, a five-year or 60,000-mile powertrain warranty and (on battery packs larger than the 24 kWh pack) an eight-year or 100,000-mile battery warranty. Most first-gen Leafs will be out of warranty. Most second-gen Leafs will still have some warranty on the battery.
Remember that the battery warranty does not entitle the owner to a new battery. Nissan scores its battery capacity out of 12 bars. Dipping below 9/12 bars makes the Leaf eligible for a battery warranty repair. The warranty only covers repairs to bring the battery back up to 9/12 bars.",Ty Duffy
Tesla Model Y Juniper Could Enter Production In Shanghai In January,https://insideevs.com/news/745040/tesla-model-y-juniper-january/,The refreshed version of the world’s best-selling EV is expected to bring important changes and improvements.,2024-12-19 12:00:00,"Tesla is working on a revised version of the Model Y electric crossover called Project Juniper. Like the Highland update for the Model 3, this Model Y refresh is expected to bring numerous changes and improvements to an already very successful vehicle, but we don’t know exactly when it will enter production.
The local media in China, quoted by CnEVPost, reports that the Model Y Juniper will enter mass production in January, which is less than a month away. The Model Y is built in China at Tesla’s massive production facility in Shanghai, which supplies China and other world markets.
Tesla Model Y Juniper
There have been multiple sightings of camouflaged Model Y prototypes both in China and the U.S. with its front and rear parts hidden. It is expected to feature completely redesigned fascias and light clusters, and it may even have full-width light bars in the front and rear. It will also have revised wheel designs and new paint colors.
Inside, we expect a similar makeover to the Model 3 Highland, which lost its indicator and transmission stalks (which are available as an aftermarket add-on), but it upped the materials and assembly quality compared to the pre-refresh model. The revised Model 3 also has a much softer and more compliant suspension, which features frequency selective dampers, and we expect a similar solution will be used on the Model Y Juniper, too.
Elon Musk said that the Model Y update wasn’t a priority, which is why it was coming so much later than the Model 3 facelift, allowing the company to focus on other projects like the Cybercab. However, there are many rival models gunning for the Model Y’s success, even ones that perhaps follow its formula a bit too closely, like the Onvo L60, while others tread their own path, hoping to woo buyers with a very different proposition.
We also heard reports about a possible six-seater version of the Model Y, which would be available in China and Europe but not the United States.
The fact that the revised Model Y may enter production in China in early 2025 isn’t necessarily relevant for the U.S. market since the locally sold Model Y is made in the States. However, there have been multiple camouflaged Model Y prototype sightings in the U.S., the most recent being in San Jose, California, which may indicate that Stateside production is also imminent.

Honda-Nissan Merger May Prevent A Hostile Takeover,https://insideevs.com/news/744929/2024-12-19-cm/,"Plus, Canoo is once again in trouble as it furloughs more workers and Subaru is betting big on a new hybrid plant.",2024-12-19 10:15:19,"The world was a bit shocked when news of a potential merger between Honda and Nissan was dropped. But the bigger question that crossed many minds was, ""Why?"" We know Nissan has been in some financial trouble lately, but for Honda to consider throwing it such a lifeline is perplexing. However, new reports indicate that Honda could be a bulwark between Nissan and a potential hostile takeover.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Honda and Nissan's merger talks potentially entering the negotiation phase as early as next week, plus Canoo furloughs even more workers, and Subaru's secret weapon: hybrids. Let's jump in.
The rumors have been circulating all week: industry big-wig Honda and troubled Nissan could be in talks for one of the most unexpected mergers in recent years. While critics remained skeptical of initial reports, Bloomberg confirmed that higher-ups at both companies have been in talks over a deal, and perhaps an even bigger shocker, it could spill over to become a triumvirate that includes Mitsubishi as well.
These types of deals typically move at the speed of molasses. So it should come as a surprise that a new report from Nikkei Asia, the publication that originally reported initial talks of a merger, says that formal negotiations could begin as early as next week on Dec. 23.
Make no mistake—this marriage isn't really one of convenience. Honda has been working to pivot its focus to electrification for some time. Following a dissolved partnership with General Motors, Honda joined forces with Nissan (and then Mitsubishi) to form a technical partnership to accelerate the development of EV-related tech.
So what's the rush in speeding up negotiations? For starters, Nissan has a time clock running. Some have pegged the company's chance for survival requiring a complete financial turnaround in 12 to 14 months.
Other reports suggest that the trifecta alliance was at risk of falling apart after Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn approached Nissan to acquire a stake in the company. Reuters says that Jun Seki, former deputy COO of Nissan who now leads Foxconn's EV unit, is headed to France to speak with Renault to purchase at least some of the automaker's stake in Nissan. Renault currently holds a 15% stake in Nissan.
According to reports, Foxconn ""directly expressed"" its willingness to purchase Nissan equity directly. Honda reportedly threatened to dissolve the partnership if Foxconn were to purchase Nissan, and ultimately Nissan declined to sell to Foxconn. The Taiwanese company then approached Renault.
Here's where things get interesting. Bloomberg says that Honda could be positioning itself as ""a white knight in the event of a hostile takeover attempt,"" which may be exactly what's starting as Foxconn has reportedly approached Renault about purchasing the shares given that Nissan has already declined to sell.
Either way, company officials have yet to comment about talks of the merger publicly other than a joint statement addressing that the brands were “considering various possibilities for future collaboration.""
It's starting to sound like a broken record at this point, but EV startup Canoo is in trouble. Yes, again. Or maybe still. Either way, the startup has once again furloughed employees and is officially pressing pause on its Oklahoma manufacturing plant in order to scrape together funds to stay afloat.
Its decision to furlough 82 of its remaining employees comes just over a month after it decided to furlough about 30 people in November, bringing an estimated 90-day halt to more than 130 workers. The brand went from 800 employees at its peak in 2021 to a currently unspecified number. Its most recent round of furloughs represents both salaried and hourly employees and is a grasp to remain alive as it remains in “advanced discussions with various capital sources,"" according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
TechCrunch points out a few recent events that led up to today's furloughs:
The announcement comes just a few days after board member James Chen resigned, and roughly one month after the company saw its chief financial officer and head lawyer depart. Canoo is also facing multiple lawsuits from suppliers over alleged late payments.

The new furloughs cap what has been a rough year for the startup. The company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs and furloughs, and closed the Los Angeles office that used to serve as its headquarters. Canoo’s chief technology officer left in August, and all of the company’s founders are now gone. In the meantime, it has been kept afloat by loans from the venture firm run by its CEO, Tony Aquila.
“We regret having to furlough our employees, especially during the holidays, but we have no choice at this point,"" wrote Canoo in a statement published by TechCrunch. ""We are hopeful that we will be able to bring them back to work soon.”
As for the idled plant, it's not quite clear exactly what Canoo is manufacturing in Oklahoma right now. The most obvious answer is debt, as the brand isn't exactly pumping out vehicles left and right. Sure, it had some trial contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, the U.S. Postal Service, and the State of Oklahoma, but Canoo's future was far from its original plans of being a consumer-facing EV manufacturer with some pretty darn cool cars.
The future for Canoo looks bleak. Lawsuits over unpaid bills, furloughed employees, and little commercial interest in its vehicles being communicated to the public make it seem like the brand could go belly-up in the coming months without a sack of investor cash being dropped on its doorstep.
Subaru is well known for its rugged all-wheel-drive cars—whether it be sporty sedans like the WRX or capable family SUVs like the Ascent, the automaker has a reputation for being the go-to brand in many parts of the world are plagued with less-then-stellar weather. However, one thing that Subaru isn't exactly known for is electrification.
The brand has admittedly had a late start to the EV game. Its only EV on sale today, the Solterra, was brought to market with the help of Toyota. As will its next four EV models if its joint-development partnership continues as planned. Subaru has found itself in a bit of a conundrum—it doesn't yet have the battery tech to compete with the rest of the industry on its own, and with strict emission regulations cracking down across the globe, its hybrid game could use some work, too. Thankfully, the automaker has a Hail Mary up its sleeve for the latter, according to Automotive News.
See, Subaru wants to electrify all its models in the first half of the 2030s. This means either going full battery-electric (as it's doing with the help of Toyota on some models) or varying degrees of hybridization, both standard and plug-in.
Enter the Kitamoto factory. This plant has been around since 1995 and has served Subaru well for non-passenger car needs (think industrial equipment, snowmobiles, and the like). The automaker phased out this area of its business in 2019 and has since chosen the facility to be the home of its new hybrid transaxle—the last-ditch effort to keep its venerable Boxer engine alive in a world where there are plenty of more efficient choices to choose from.
Kitamoto is Subaru's answer to a stop-gap between combustion and full electrification. The brand plans to apply the lessons learned at Kitamoto to its next-gen Oizumi plant that will build future EV and hybrids after 2027.
This particular plant has started the production of Subaru's new electrified transaxle that will power a new generation of strong hybrids beginning with the next-gen Crosstrek and Forester crossovers. In Japan, this will begin as early as Spring 2025. The U.S. will receive the transaxle the following year—built in Kitamoto and shipped to its plant in Lafayette, Indiana where the next-gen Forester will be built.
The U.S. market accounts for 71% of Subaru's global sales. And hybrids? Well, Americans are lapping them up as of late. In fact, hybrids made up 10.8% of the entire light-duty vehicle market last quarter, significantly ahead of the 7% share for BEVs in Q3. To remain relevant, Subaru needs to compete in the hybrids segment, and its underpowered mild hybrids have historically not been the right answer.
So while Subaru might not be at the forefront of pure electrification, it is pouring its heart into pumping up its hybrid offerings to keep competing in global and U.S. markets. Kitamoto will prove to be Subaru's proving ground—that it can scale and compete with even the biggest player. More importantly, it means keeping a legend, its horizontally opposed Boxer motor, alive.
Subaru's push forward with hybrids over pure electrification is an interesting one. The brand is a small player compared to other Japanese giants, which means that dumping billions of dollars into a homegrown electrification program isn't as easy as, say, Ford, GM, or any other the big European brands out there. Joining forces for development (like it's done with Toyota already) is a logical step forward.
Other big automakers are also pulling back from their once-big electrification plans and others have always insisted that a ""multipathway"" approach was the right way to go.
Do you think that Subaru's approach will work in the long run? Where might it run into some hurdles along the way? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

Tesla's Head Designer Hints Robotaxi Could Get Additional Form Factors,https://insideevs.com/news/744880/tesla-robotaxi-additional-form-factors/,Could this be the Robovan concept or something else?,2024-12-19 10:00:23,"Tesla's Robotaxi ambitions are sending its share soaring right now. Investors are riled up over Tesla's promises to deliver a commercial autonomy platform, and that all starts with its first dedicated vehicle: the Cybercab.
During a recent overview of the Cybercab at the Petersen Automotive Museum, Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen made a cryptic remark: “We have other vehicles in our lineup and future vehicles coming that will basically take multiple passengers.” Could this be referring to the teased Robovan concept, or does Tesla have something else up its sleeve for its future fleet of autonomous cars?
Let's remember that Travis Axelrod, Tesla's Head of Investor Relations, told Deutsche Bank that 2025 would be ""a year of product launches.""  We know this refers to Tesla's unofficially-named ""Model Q"" and a long wheelbase Model Y with three rows for the Chinese market, but Axelrod also noted that the second half of 2025 would feature the release of ""other new vehicles""—yes, that's vehicles with an ""s.""
Between Axelrod and von Holzhausen's comments, it raises the question of whether or not Tesla has some additional Robotaxis on the horizon that the world has yet to see.
Tesla has said that designing the Cybercab with two seats was deliberate. Data suggests that most ride-hailing trips involve just one or two passengers, meaning that Tesla could cut down on costs and maximize storage by limiting the Cybercab to just two seats. However, that leaves a huge gap in the market for larger groups of people looking to hail a ride from an autonomous car.
Tesla has long planned to fill that gap using its fleet of existing cars on the road as robotaxis. Even before the robotaxi was a twinkle in Elon Musk's eye, the CEO had talked about launching the Tesla Network, an autonomous ride-sharing app that utilizes customer-owned Teslas equipped with Full Self-Driving to provide Uber-like services when not in use. That was all the way back in 2020 and a lot has changed since then—like the idea of bringing a dedicated robotaxi platform with no steering wheels or pedals into the mix.
One of the biggest hurdles for this approach comes from within. Tesla will first have to figure out if its cars equipped with aging Hardware 3 and current Hardware 4 FSD computers will be able to actually operate fully autonomously. The Cybercab will ship with Hardware 5 (or, as Musk has called it, AI5). It's unclear if older cars will be able to operate at a hardware level necessary for Level 5 fully automated driving, which means either Tesla pushes existing models with new FSD hardware, or consider new dedicated vehicles. Could this be what Franz has suggested during his talk at Petersen?
It's questionable if the next dedicated platform will be the Robovan, as that would require certain costly accessibility concessions to the Tesla network very early on rather than be developed as it grows. The Robovan, which is slated for carrying over 20 people, must meet the Americans With Disabilities Act's ""readily accessible and usable"" standard for demand-responsive transportation systems—meaning that the Robovan must be designed from the ground up to be immediately usable by people with disabilities (think built-in ramps, doors, and multimodal controls). The two-seater Cybercab (and the rest of Tesla's fleet) would only need to provide ""equivalent service,"" which would be an alternative method for folks with disabilities to utilize the service.
This is obviously a more complicated approach to launching a service, which is why Tesla could be focused on launching smaller capacity vehicles—like the Cybercab and enabling the function on existing models—prior to the Robovan. Even General Motors recently threw in the towel with Cruise's robotaxi service, given concerns over the capital requirements to launch and maintain it.
Von Holzhausen's comments hint at Tesla's bigger picture. Its CEO has said time and time again that Tesla's is an AI company that just happens to build cars, so maximizing its offerings to meet that narrative would be Tesla's main priority. Tesla has yet to confirm what other robotaxi designs—if any—are in development, but it's clear that the company sees the need for additional models across its fleet to meet some needs; otherwise, why would Axelrod drop the hint that Tesla would announce several vehicles in the new year?
For now, the Cybercab and Robovan are the only two dedicated robotaxi platforms that Tesla has officially previewed to the world. Whether it complements those vehicles with existing models or completely new vehicles is still to be seen, but it at least creates a bit of justification for Tesla's hyped-up stock price.

BMW Built An All-Electric M2 Prototype,https://www.motor1.com/news/744902/bmw-m2-ev-prototype/,A small team of engineers has been working on this car since 2018.,2024-12-25 01:24:59,"BMW's M division is going electric. Last week the company teased an all-electric version of its iconic M3, set to hit showrooms in 2027. Now, the company is showing off another all-electric M car: A prototype based on the first-generation M2 coupe.
The car, internally called The Beast, was conceived by a small group of engineers in 2018 on a ""mission to explore what's possible,"" according to Michael Sailer, one of the team's dynamics engineers.
The car looks fairly stock on the outside, save for a couple of tow hooks, a ducktail trunk spoiler, and a set of gold-painted brake calipers—likely carbon-ceramics. The cabin has been stripped to accommodate a roll cage, a racing seat, and a suite of testing equipment.
BMW did not go into detail on the M2 prototype's powertrain, but it's clear the factory turbocharged straight-six has been replaced by some kind of electric power. Seeing as how every electric M car will have four motors, this M2 may be rocking a quad-motor setup itself. But that's just speculation.
Engineers describe the battery-powered M2 prototype as hard to control. M boss Frank Van Meel compares it to the F10-generation M5, which sent power to the rear wheels only, making it a relative handful considering its twin-turbo V-8 power. It forced the team to turn to AWD for the next-generation car.
""I can still remember January 2015, Cobo Hall, Detroit Motor Show, where I said in an interview, the next M5 generation will need four-wheel drive,"" he said. ""And everyone was going 'this is the end of the universe,' because if you put four-wheel drive on an M car it will only go straight forward, there will be no dynamics left.""
Van Meel said he had to ""live with this shit-storm"" for three years until the first all-wheel drive M5 came out, then everyone drove it and loved it. He likens the transition to electric power to the transition from rear-wheel drive to all-wheel drive.
""Trust me, that what we're working on now for the future will be at least as great as what we did [with the first AWD M5],"" he said. ""Now we will make that beast controllable, so that the next step in high performance is on the horizon.""

"Rivian R1S And R1T EVs Finally Get Native YouTube, Google Cast And SiriusXM",https://insideevs.com/news/744996/rivian-r1s-r1t-youtube-google-cast-sirius-xm/,"Netflix is still unavailable, but owners can use other apps like Disney+ and Max to cast videos to their vehicle's screen.",2024-12-19 06:12:16,"Rivian makes some very compelling adventure-oriented electric cars, but if you were stuck charging on a slow DC stall, you had very limited multimedia options on the built-in center touchscreen.
Some owners found clever workarounds such as using a USB memory stick to watch pre-downloaded videos, but that’s no longer needed, as the California-based startup is finally rolling out features that have been promised for over a year.
A native YouTube app, a native SiriusXM app, as well as Google Cast functionality, are rolling out right now as part of the software version 2024.47, which is available for both the first- and second-gen R1S and R1T.
More Rivian Stories
The update was announced back in May when Rivian said it would come “soon.” Well, it’s finally here, which means owners can watch YouTube videos on the car’s center screen without having to use their smartphone. The same goes for the SiriusXM app, which uses WiFi or cellular data to stream audio to the vehicle’s speakers.
When it comes to Google Cast, you can think of it as having a built-in Chromecast in the car. If you’re unfamiliar with the tech, it basically means you can use a smartphone as a remote to cast content, including video, to the car’s screen. The content is pulled from the internet by the car, but you need a smartphone to control things like subtitles or choose episodes from a TV series.
Videos can only be played while the car is in Park. Furthermore, while video streaming apps that offer Google Cast functionality include Netflix, Amazon, Prime, Disney+ and Max, Rivian R1S and R1T owners cannot currently cast content from the Netflix app.
Things get a little more complicated when looking at how Rivian is bundling these new features. The YouTube app and Google Cast functionality are part of the company’s Connect+ technology package which costs $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. Connect+ also includes an in-vehicle hotspot, satellite images for the navigation system, Amazon Alexa commands, Apple Music, Audible, Spotify, Tidal, TuneIn, Gear Guard Live Cam and priority software updates.
SiriusXM satellite radio, on the other hand, is separate from the Connect+ bundle and needs a subscription bought directly from SiriusXM, which costs between $9.99 and $24.98 per month.
Rivian said all customers will have “a temporary preview of the Google Cast and YouTube features that can be streamed through Connect+,” and that a free trial subscription to SiriusXM will be offered.
Besides these new features, the latest software version includes improvements for the Highway Assist system on Gen 2 vehicles, new graphics for some sections of the infotainment system and a bunch of smaller fixes.",Iulian Dnistran
European EV Sales Were A Mixed Bag In November,https://insideevs.com/news/744949/ev-sales-europe-november-2024/,"Hybrids increased their market share once again, while gas- and diesel-powered cars continued their decline.",2024-12-19 02:40:48,"As the year is coming to an end, the European electric vehicle market couldn’t be murkier. It’s a mishmash of numbers and depending on where you look or who you ask, you might get two completely different answers to the question, “How are EVs doing in Europe?”
In November, some countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland and Czechia had double- and even triple-digit increases in EV registrations, while others, such as Croatia, France, Germany and Romania had double-digit decreases in EV registrations last month compared to the same period last year.
These are all members of the European Union, but there’s also the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, that can go into the mix. The United Kingdom is also a big market that needs to be considered.
More Stuff Like This
So, how does the electric vehicle market look in Europe? In November, EV registrations in the European Union went down 9.5% compared to the same month last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). However, when adding the numbers for the EFTA and the UK, registrations actually went up 0.9%.
In the first 11 months of the year–an arguably more important metric than the monthly numbers–EV registrations in the EU went down 5.4% compared to last year. In the EU, EFTA and UK, registrations went down 1.4%. To date, a total of 1,787,600 EVs were registered in Europe, down from last year’s 1,812,987. Some countries like Germany, France and Romania reduced or removed financial incentives for buying all-electric vehicles this year, and it shows in their registration numbers.
The only power source that saw consistent gains throughout the year is hybrid electric. Last month, hybrid vehicle registrations increased by 16.4% compared to last year. Year-to-date, 3,704,732 hybrids were registered in the EU, EFTA and UK, an 18.7% increase year-on-year.
Monthly car registrations in Europe, November 2024
January-November 2024 vehicle registration numbers in Europe
Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) went down 8.6% in November, with 83,400 registrations. Year-to-date, PHEVs recorded a decrease of 4.6% with a total of 860,739 units registered. Gas- and diesel-powered cars were also down. Gasoline vehicle registrations declined 12.4% in November and 6.6% after 11 months. Meanwhile, diesel registrations went down 15.4% last month 11.6% year-to-date.
Overall, the European car market, including the EU, EFTA and UK, went down 2% in November. Year-to-date, the market went up a very modest 0.6%, an increase attributed almost entirely to the uptick in hybrid vehicle registrations.
All this being said, probably the most important takeaway is that the market share for both gasoline and diesel cars is shrinking. Eleven months into 2024, gas vehicles have a 33.4% market share, down from 36% last year, while diesel cars have 10.6%, down from 12% last year. All-electric vehicles have a 15.1% market share, down from 15.4% last year. Plug-in hybrids went down from 7.6% last year to 7.2%, while hybrids soared from 26.5% market share in the first 11 months of last year to 31.2% this year.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s A First Look At Honda’s New Electric SUV,https://insideevs.com/news/744801/honda-0-series-suv-teaser/,The boxy electric crossover will go into production in 2026 alongside a wedge-shaped sedan.,2024-12-18 19:00:00,"Honda has big plans for its electric vehicle future. After collaborating with General Motors to produce the Prologue crossover–which is doing rather well, sales-wise–the Japanese automaker will do everything on its own for the next chapter.
You might have read something about the Honda 0 Series lineup, which was first previewed last year by the Saloon and Space-Hub EV concept. The Saloon was a wedge-shaped EV with strong DeLorean DMC-12 vibes and at the time, Honda was adamant that it would form the base for a series production model.
Well, now Honda has released a new teaser showing two EVs. Both are prototypes, but the automaker said they “represent the next models in the Honda 0 Series.” That’s exciting stuff because the Saloon had a pretty radical design, and it’s cool to see car manufacturers sticking to their promises and bringing some well-needed attitude to today’s roads.
More Honda Stuff
While we already know what the sedan looks like, the crossover on the right has never made an appearance until now. At first glance, it’s quite boxy, which should translate into a spacious interior. There’s a U-shaped LED light strip at the rear, as well as a pair of LED stoplights. The rear bumper also seems to protrude quite a lot.
Both prototypes will be revealed at next year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 7. Moreover, Honda will show its new proprietary vehicle operating system, as well as the automated driving tech it’s working on. The Japanese carmaker is also planning to introduce a new energy service that’s scheduled to go online when the new Honda 0 Series models go into production.
The production version of the Saloon concept is expected to go into production in 2026 at Honda’s new EV hub. It will be cheaper than the Tesla Model S or Model X, but still solidly in the premium segment, as our own Kevin Williams found out during a press trip to Honda’s R&D center in Japan. Besides the sedan, Honda is planning to launch two more electric crossovers, a three-row SUV and two more cheaper SUVs later on. A compact sedan will be the final piece of the puzzle.",Iulian Dnistran
Study Shows That Buyers Really Want Three-Row EV Crossovers,https://insideevs.com/news/744906/ev-three-row-crossover-study/,AutoPacific found that about half of all three-row crossover and SUV buyers would consider buying an EV.,2024-12-18 15:00:48,"It’s unfortunate that it feels like the EV revolution is stuttering. Yet, this lull feels more manufacturer-related. Everything’s a compact semi-luxury crossover rather than what the people really want: cheap EVs, and, according to AutoPacific’s latest study, three-row crossovers. The analyst group just released its 2024 Future Vehicle Planner, showing that a surprising number of three-row crossover shoppers would consider an electric version.
The survey asked more than 14,000 vehicle shoppers and found that “nearly half” of all three-row SUV and crossover buyers would consider going full EV. About 8% of those buyers said they intend on buying a full EV three-row crossover, something the study says is actually impressive considering the lack of three-row options on sale. Currently, there are only seven models on the market: The Volvo EX90, VinFast VF9, Tesla Model X, Rivian R1S, Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Mercedes-Benz EQB SUV and Kia EV9. Leave out those that are expensive, unproven or have tiny third rows and you're left with... just the Kia. There are more coming; the Cadillac Escalade IQ, Lucid Gravity and Hyundai Ioniq 9 are on their way next year.
This strong desire for EV three rows shows that there’s real room for growth in the segment, especially for cheaper models. AutoPacific found that 59% of three-row crossover and SUV buyers intend to spend less than $50,000. The only three-row EVs that get close to that price are the Mercedes-Benz EQB and Kia EV9. The EQB’s tiny third row might not be what families are looking for, but if judged by the fairly healthy sales of the Kia EV9, AutoPacific might just be onto something here.
The firm predicts that if trends continue, the three-row EV segment will grow from 100,000 units sold in 2024 to almost 400,000 units by 2029. “All-electric three-row SUVs and crossovers are set to become one of the most important growth segments in the EV space,” says Ed Kim, AutoPacific’s president and chief analyst.  Perhaps it wasn't so wise for Ford to kill off its three-row EV crossover.
The study also says that the ideal buyer of a three-row EV SUV is a single female who lives in a single-family house and drives less than 30 miles a day. This person is aware of the need for home EV charging but doesn’t think it’s too hard to get installed (or they have it done already). They like the convenience of a three-row vehicle, love the tech gadgets inherent to a modern EV and like the idea of an environmentally-friendly car. But, they don’t want to make any concessions to get any of that stuff. It’s not an easy target for any manufacturer to hit, that’s for sure.

EPA Approves California's Gas Car Ban,https://insideevs.com/news/744899/california-gas-car-ban-approved/,"Eleven other states follow California's emissions rules, which means a large part of the U.S. could be EV or PHEV only next decade.",2024-12-25 01:25:01,"The Biden Administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has green-lighted California's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, effectively approving the state's proposes gas car ban. With 11 other states already committed to adopting the regulations and the first set of requirements taking effect in 2026, this will have a seismic impact on the U.S. auto market.
If it survives.
California has long been given the authority to impose different, tighter emissions standards on top of federal regulations. This dates to the Clean Air Act days, as California's geography makes it particularly susceptible to smog. Low-lying coastal areas fenced in by mountains can cause heavy pollutants to settle, which blanketed much of LA with thick smog that was dangerous to breathe consistently. But the EPA has to approve many of its environmental regulations, and incoming President Trump is likely to roll back federal support for this initiative.
During his first term, he withdrew California's ability to set its own new vehicle rules. Biden reinstated it. Trump has promised to roll back any EV mandates this time around, and that's what this policy effectively is. Advanced Clean Cars II will require 100% of light-duty passenger vehicle sales to be Zero-Emissions Vehicles—EVs or Hydrogen vehicles—or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). To ramp up to that, it requires 35% of all new vehicle sales to be ZEVs or PHEVs in 2026, with the quota getting stricter from there.
Eleven other states are committed to following this plan, albeit some of them with different timelines. Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington are all on board. Washington D.C. is also committed. This is important, as the broad number of states and their relatively scattered geography make it difficult for automakers to handle compliance. They can't ignore these states—California alone is the nation's biggest auto market—but they also can't just ship all of their EVs west and continue as normal in the rest of the country.
California is a car-heavy state, with regulations that affect the whole auto market.
The hard part is that the market is not yet moving fast enough to satisfy California's requirements, and there's not much time before the 2026 targets hit. About 25% of vehicles sold in California this year will be EVs, with PHEVs taking up around 4% of sales. If you include standard hybrids California is already above the 35% threshold, but the regulations don't count those. While California may be able to hit that 35% target in 2026, it remains to be seen whether the other states will get there.
Or if it'll matter at all. The approval is unlikely to survive a Trump Administration EPA. While California can and likely will fight for its right to set strict emissions standards, that's a court battle that could easily end up at the Supreme Court. A quick decision is unlikely.

That's a big, big problem. You can have your own opinion on the EV mandates. I certainly do. I'm not sure that the timeline is realistic for the states outside of California, and the auto industry is starting to crack under the financial pressure of having to sell so many EVs at a loss. But climate change demands action, and some companies are clearly slow-rolling things. Wherever you fall though, there's one obvious truth: Multi-billion-dollar industries with global supply chains, crazy high investment costs, skilled labor pools and countless challenges in dozens of markets cannot afford this level of uncertainty.
Mandate EVs or don't. But if we spend another four years jockeying back and forth with wild swings in the regulatory climate, the U.S. auto market will face a collapse like it's never seen. The industry needs clarity, and so do consumers.

"Tesla Model Y Juniper Spotted Driving In San Jose, California",https://insideevs.com/news/744569/tesla-model-y-juniper-update-spotted-video/,"This sighting is one of many, and the car is still lightly camouflaged.",2024-12-18 13:00:02,"We all know by now that Teslas get better over time due to almost constant software updates. However, there comes a time when an overhaul is due and for the Model Y, that time has to be soon. With the Tesla Model 3 getting its significant ""Highland"" upgrade, the question now is, when will the Model Y ""Juniper"" upgrade enter production?
More Model Y Juniper Info
The Highland version of the Model 3 came equipped with a revised exterior, a revised front fascia featuring new headlight clusters, slimmer taillights, redesigned mirrors, new wheel designs and new exterior colors, as well as a much-improved suspension. We expect the Juniper version of the Model Y to pretty closely match the updates found on the new Model 3, which also means that the interior should get the new steering wheel from the Model 3, which has more buttons than before because it no longer has stalks on the steering column.
With the Juniper Model Y launch looming, public sightings have become more common. This latest sighting comes to us via Colin W. on X, who spotted the Juniper near San Jose, California. It's a brief clip, but it gives a pretty clear view of the Model Y's driver's side, which only has some camo on the front and rear.
The biggest change we saw with the Highland Model 3 was its improved ride. It got a completely revised suspension system, transforming it into a much more comfortable car. We expect this to carry over to the revised Model Y but is that a big enough improvement for you to consider waiting for the updated version of the Model Y? Since we don't know when it will arrive, we're on the fence here, especially since there's a chance that the Model Y will lose its $7,500 tax credit soon.
Here's what we suggest. If you don’t need the Model Y’s roomier trunk and easier access, the cheaper revised Model 3 is probably a better option. If you need the extra room, either buy a Model Y now and get the tax credit or wait for the revised version, which may not get the credit. It's a bit of a gamble, though.

"Ram Delays Full EV Pickup, Bets On Ramcharger EREV First",https://insideevs.com/news/744905/ram-1500-ramcharger-rev-delay/,Ram will open orders for the Ramcharger pickup in the first half of 2025.,2024-12-18 12:41:33,"Ram parent company Stellantis on Wednesday said it will delay the brand's first fully electric pickup truck, the 1500 REV, to 2026 from its previously announced launch date of early 2025.
But there's good news for fans of the brand's upcoming extended-range EV pickup, the Ramcharger. That innovative model, essentially an EV with a gas generator that boosts range, isn't going anywhere. Stellantis says orders will open up for customers in the first half of 2025.
Ram 1500 REV
Slowing growth in the EV market has pushed scores of automakers to pull back their EV investments and delay new products. Stellantis said the decision was partially motivated by ""slowing industry demand for half-ton BEV pickups.""
And in that way, the move makes sense. Ford—and, let's be honest, everybody else—thought the electric F-150 Lightning would be a way bigger hit than it has been. General Motors has launched three EV pickups in the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and GMC Hummer EV. So Ram's truck will have a lot of rivals in a market that just isn't developing as the industry expected it to.
Part of the problem there is that electric trucks need huge batteries to deliver any kind of range, and that makes them way more expensive than their gas counterparts. Plus, towing anything deals a huge blow to range. The Ramcharger seeks to solve some of those issues. It has a 92-kilowatt-hour battery, plus an engine that feeds it extra juice and doesn't power the wheels. The idea is that on longer trips or under heavy loads, the Ramcharger can do more than a standard EV can.
And other companies are following Ram's lead here. Stellantis is planning extended-range Jeeps, while Hyundai has some EREVs up its sleeve too.

His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

"The Nissan-Honda Crisis, Explained",https://insideevs.com/news/744875/honda-nissan-charging-cm/,We knew Honda and Nissan were entering into a technical partnership. Now a merger may be in the cards to save a struggling Nissan.,2024-12-18 10:45:25,"The news sent shockwaves across the auto industry, Wall Street and even the consumer space: Struggling Japanese automaker Nissan may merge with considerably less struggling Japanese automaker Honda. If you own, have owned or are a fan of either brand, this may come as a total surprise to you, and that's understandable. But I'm about to fill you in on why this might be happening and what it means for the entire car business as a whole.
That's the lead item on this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Make sure you subscribe to our newsletter in the link below and check out the Plugged-In Podcast from InsideEVs, with new episodes dropping on audio platforms and YouTube on Fridays.
Also on tap today: some good news on the EV charging front, even with President Donald Trump coming in with a vendetta against electric funding. Let's dig in.
Honda Nissan Mitsubishi Partnership
I've actually been inundated with text messages about this news from my normal friends and family members—you know, people who don't fastidiously read automotive trade publications, Bloomberg and the Financial Times multiple times a day. ""Wait, Nissan and Honda?"" they ask. ""What's wrong with Nissan? Or Honda?""
That's because most people don't understand the rough shape that Nissan, specifically, is in these days. It's just kind of one of those normal, everyday car brands that people buy when they don't want to think that much about buying a car, or its specs, or how it looks—they need something new and they need a good deal. But that's the problem. That's what that brand has become in the U.S., its biggest and most important global market.
What people don't realize is that Nissan's sales and profits here and worldwide have been tanking for years now. Dealer profits in the U.S. are down 70% year-over-year. Operating profit plunged by 99% in its first financial quarter. Sales have been sliding even worse in China, where homegrown car brands have been displacing the Western and other Asian ones at a rapid pace for years now.
The cars may offer decent deals, but they aren't competitive in terms of technology. Nissan sells no hybrid cars in the U.S. at a time when they're having a huge moment. (The opposite is true for Toyota, for example, which is having a great year thanks to hybrids.) And despite being an early mover in the EV space, Nissan only sells the outdated Leaf and the so-so Ariya, while it's delayed a slew of other models; it doesn't have the momentum that, say, General Motors or Hyundai have in the electric realm.
You can blame this on a lot of things, but one of the biggest culprits is the fallout from two crises: the fall of its former megaboss Carlos Ghosn and the talent drain that happened afterward, followed by the yearslong renegotiation of Nissan's often-awkward alliance with Renault. All that chaos didn't leave Nissan very prepared for the future, and its outdated technology and lineup of cars is catching up to it now.
“The announced merger talks between Nissan and Honda are not surprising, given the recent turbulence impacting legacy automakers globally,"" said Michael Brisson, auto economist at Moody’s Analytics, in an email to InsideEVs. ""Nissan's financial struggles are in no small part a consequence of the surging competition from Chinese automakers. Their 2023 retail sales in China were roughly half of their 2019 figures, a year when China accounted for one in three of Nissan's global sales.""
""These Nissan-Honda merger discussions, coupled with the recent challenges at Stellantis and production cutbacks in Europe, all point to a single, stark reality: a new force has emerged in the automotive sector, and legacy automakers need to be acutely aware of the competitive threat,"" Brisson said.
So, yes. Things are worse at Nissan than your average person probably knows. Now, where does Honda enter into this?
Like the rest of Japan Inc., Honda is behind on fully electric cars (which is a longer story, but here's a good summary of why.) But Honda's cars still sell well. It makes hybrids people like. It's profitable. And Honda really seems to have gotten a wake-up call from the rise of China's automakers, so while it's late to the game, it's orchestrating a big EV push that we'll see the fruits of in the coming years.
To get ahead of the EV powerhouse that is China, these automakers need money, expertise and scale. These are huge investments. They require tons of capital to develop batteries and software, and own the supply chains to develop both. This isn't a game of who makes the best internal-combustion engines anymore. It's a totally different game. And Japan Inc. can either catch up or die, probably at the hands of China's BYD and others.
In response, we've seen Japan's auto industry coalesce around two factions: one led by Toyota that includes Mazda, Subaru and Daihatsu, and another with Honda and Nissan and probably Mitsubishi. Honda and Nissan announced a technical partnership earlier this year to co-develop EVs and software. Now, it could turn into a full-blown merger instead.
Nikkei Asia first reported the news yesterday and it's been featured in countless other outlets, so I do think it has legs. The theory is the two would operate under a holding company that could also eventually include Mitsubishi.
I also think Honda was sparked into action—perhaps even by the Japanese government—over reports that a Chinese automaker or other firm could acquire some or all of Nissan. In theory, that could give one of those companies a way into the U.S. or a better path to Europe through Nissan's dealer networks. Obviously, Japan doesn't want that.
Now the question is, will it actually happen? Here's CNBC with some analysis I like:
The merger report comes at a time when many auto giants are struggling to cope with increased global competition from bigger electric vehicle (EV), makers such as Tesla and China’s BYD.
A mega-merger, however, is expected to face several obstacles. Analysts have expressed concerns about the likelihood of political scrutiny in Japan, given the potential for job cuts if a deal pushes through, while the unwinding of Nissan’s alliance with French vehicle manufacturer Renault is regarded as pivotal to the process.
“This tie-up is not entirely unexpected because obviously they announced their partnership earlier this year,” Lucinda Guthrie, executive editor at Mergermarket, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe” on Wednesday.
“Some of the reports I’ve seen claim that this came about as a result of Foxconn making an approach to Nissan. Now, with this particular transaction, I question whether it is going to be a hardcore merger or whether it is going to be more of a partnership,” she added.
Make no mistake: Honda is the savior here. Or would be, if this goes through. One analyst told CNBC that the deal ""would likely have a negative impact for Honda, but a positive one for Nissan and Mitsubishi.""
But whatever's going to happen will likely take years. The renegotiation of Nissan's situationship with Renault certainly did, and remember that automaker is part-owned by the French government. And here's the thing: if it does work, these companies have more capital to play with, but also a bigger organization, very different internal cultures and challenges around which brand should be doing what.
If this is a survival play for either company—but especially Nissan—success is far from guaranteed.
Electrify America EV Chargers
But it's not all doom and gloom in the EV space. Everyone who watches it closely has been fearful of Trump's threats to axe the EV tax credits, which would almost certainly dampen sales and derail the electric transition the Biden administration was pushing so hard for. Yet one thing that could hurt EV growth even more is if funding for public fast chargers were to dry up as well.
Automotive News reports today that thankfully, that isn't very likely. Why? Because much of that money has already been doled out to states, which then distribute it to various companies that then build the chargers:
“It would take almost an act of God for Trump or Congress to overturn” the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, said Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, which recently acquired McDonald’s EV Adoption firm.
That’s because much of the $5 billion that underpins the initiative has already been doled out to the states. The remainder was preapproved. Policymakers designed the five-year program, which started in 2021, to help states create a network of public charging stations in 50-mile intervals along interstates.
Eleven states have opened more than 30 charging sites with more than 130 ports, backed by the federal funds, according to Paren.
States receive the funding and manage their own EV infrastructure programs that comply with federal requirements, like they do with roads and bridges.
They have received nearly half — about $2.4 billion — of the EV charging program’s funds, according to Atlas Public Policy. The full $5 billion was already approved as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
“Congress really doesn’t need to do anything for the program to continue,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy. “A lot of funding is going out the door. A lot of construction is underway, and I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.”
That's promising. But we'll find out more in January.
GM Energy ChargePoint EV Charging Station
Here's a great example. General Motors and ChargePoint announced today that they are ""are accelerating the deployment of DC fast charging across the U.S. through an incentive program,"" and that will yield 500 ultra-fast charging ports open by the end of 2025.
From a news release:
Many of the new locations will be equipped with ChargePoint’s Omni Port system, which allows vehicles with CCS or NACS charging ports to use any charger, without the need to carry an adapter or dedicate a parking space to a particular connector type. Many of the new locations will feature ultra-fast charging through ChargePoint’s Express Plus platform, capable of charging speeds up to 500kW.
Get excited to see a lot more of those soon.
Will this potential merger allow both Japanese automakers to thrive in the future, or is it too little, too late? And would these two even be good partners with one another? Let us know what you think in the comments.

"Not So Fast On Ebike Licensing Requirements, Say Some NYC Officials",https://www.rideapart.com/news/744254/ebike-licensing-fight-nyc-council/,Delivery workers could potentially be hit hard if licensing and registration are required. Don't they go through enough?,2024-12-25 01:25:03,"Earlier this week, news arose from New York City that some legislators were pushing a bill that would require e-bike riders to license and register their e-bikes. One quick note: For clarification, I'm talking about electric bicycles; I'm stating this up front because I've seen some other news outlets use ""e-bikes"" to also refer to electric motorcycles.
Anyway, I can't speak for the rest of my colleagues here. But at one time, I delivered food on a motorbike. Not an e-bike, to be clear, or a bicycle; but I did food deliveries on a motorbike. It's the kind of experience that doesn't leave you. If you've ever been a delivery rider, chances are excellent you also have plenty of stories about your time in the food-schlepping saddle.
Naturally, with my past experience, the first thing I wondered about is how such NYC legislation would affect the countless e-bike delivery riders that crisscross the city on a daily basis. And from the sounds of the City Council hearing that took place yesterday, according to Gothamist, I'm far from the only one.
NYC Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said that while the bill's logic with regard to increasing safety was there, enforcement of such a measure would weigh most heavily on delivery riders.
Rodriguez also pointed out that, by his office's count, there have so far been 105 pedestrian fatalities in NYC as a result of collisions with cars, trucks, and other large vehicles. By contrast, he said, only six people (that's a single digit, six) have died after colliding with e-bikes, mopeds, and e-scooters. And it's almost mid-December.
E-bikes have been around for a little while, but are the relatively new kid on the block in the grand scheme of practical urban transportation. So, some confusion and disagreement about how best to regulate them in the public interest is to be expected.
But there are multiple reasons why licensing and registering them doesn't make much (if any) sense. Do you also license and/or register your regular bicycle? No, you do not. Before e-bikes, plenty of delivery riders were using those to commute, too. E-bikes may have democratized delivery riding a bit more, because they allow even riders who aren't in peak physical condition to go out and do the thing.
This is pure anecdata, but I've seen plenty of unsafe bicycle riding during my years of riding bicycles, e-bikes, and more powerful motorbikes that do (and should) require licensing and registration. And I'm sure you have, too.
The thing that both pedal-bicycle and e-bike riders have in common is that they probably don't want to crash any more than you do. Why? Because in both cases, they're very likely going to be the ones to get seriously injured or even killed.
The lives of delivery riders are stressful enough. At either end, you're at the mercy of two sets of people with two sets of expectations: Whatever restaurant or service you're delivering the food for, and the customers you're delivering the food to. In between, you have what amounts to a platform-style video game full of obstacles you have to successfully traverse in order to get the food to the customer in a timely matter, undamaged, and hopefully at a reasonable temperature.
If you live in the US, you also know that we're a tipping culture, with tipped minimum wages that vary in different areas. In NYC, as of January 1, 2024, the tipped food service worker minimum wage is now $10.65 per hour with a $5.35 tip credit. Tipped service employees must receive $13.35 per hour by law, with a $2.65 tip credit.
How does that impact third-party food delivery service workers, though? NYC regulates third-party food delivery apps, so your Seamless and your DoorDash and your Uber Eats delivery workers all must get at least $19.56 per hour, before tips. For some perspective, as of May 2024, a person living in NYC would need to make a little over $40 an hour to afford fair market rent on a one-bedroom apartment.
TL;DR: Milking blood from a stone doesn't work.

Lucid Wants More Partners. It's Currently In Talks With 'A Couple',https://insideevs.com/news/744828/lucid-more-oem-partners-wanted/,Lucid's CEO said the EV manufacturer is in talks with “a couple” of automakers. One of them could be Hyundai's Genesis.,2024-12-18 07:15:21,"Although Lucid Motors is a startup with much less car-making experience than traditional OEMs, it has quickly become an electric vehicle technology leader. It’s willing to share its EV tech with others and it’s already helping Aston Martin create its own bespoke EV platform. However, it also wants to find more automakers to partner with.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the company was currently in talks with “a couple” of automakers, but he didn’t name names—one of them is probably Genesis. He said, “It would be lovely if we could supply technology to a traditional car company to help them on their way to sustainability, and perhaps we can leverage economies of scale with their parts bin and other aspects of the business.”
In other words, Lucid would be interested in supplying its EV tech and expect to gain know-how from its potential partners. This doesn’t apply to its deal with Aston Martin, which is one-sided for now, but Lucid expects to earn more than just money from its future partnerships. Aston Martin will launch its first EV, which will have Lucid tech and know-how, in 2026, and it says it has several EVs in the pipeline.
Lucid isn’t the only EV startup looking for established OEM partners. Rivian set up a multi-billion dollar joint venture deal with Volkswagen to develop electric vehicles. VW has pledged to invest close to $6 billion, and the partnership’s first vehicles are expected to debut in 2027. Apparently, a Volkswagen EV prototype is already running on a Rivian platform with Rivian tech.
Volkswagen also owns the Scout EV brand, so it’s not entirely unreasonable to suggest that the upcoming Scout Terra and Traveler may have some components in common. That will make the fact that Scout and Rivian are not the same company even less apparent.
Lucid’s in-house-developed electric motors and 900-volt platform allow it to make some of the most efficient electric vehicles in the world. The startup lacks knowledge about scaling up production into the hundreds of thousands, which is where the experience provided by an established automaker would be very useful.
More Lucid Stories
Now in the process of ramping up production of its second model, the Gravity full size SUV, Lucid will then move on to preparing the start of production for its third model. This will be a smaller and more affordable midsize electric SUV, whose starting price will be around $48,000, so it should sell in higher volumes than any of its current models—the cheapest Lucid right now is the Air Pure, which starts at $71,400, but you can pay over $250,000 for a top-spec Air Sapphire.
Peter Rawlinson previously said that Lucid is aiming to sell 1 million vehicles annually, and it’s banking on not one but two midsize electric crossovers to get there. This year, it produced around 10,000 vehicles, so it's got a long way to go to achieve the stated goal.",Andrei Nedelea
The 2025 Rivian R1S Is The Safest Large SUV Tested By The IIHS This Year,https://insideevs.com/news/744838/2025-rivian-r1s-top-safety-pick-plus-iihs-rating/,The refreshed EV is the only large SUV to get the coveted safety rating this year.,2024-12-18 06:52:00,"The updated Rivian R1S is now the safest large SUV on American roads, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). During the latest crash testing session, the 2025 R1S got a Top Safety Pick+ rating, the highest possible for a production vehicle that goes through the IIHS testing procedure.
The result is an improvement from the previous iteration of the Rivian R1S, which got a Top Safety Pick rating. The 2025 R1S got Good ratings on all the subcategories except for the Headlights which were rated as Acceptable by the IIHS.
By contrast, the 2022 to 2024 R1S had a Marginal rating for the updated Moderate overlap front crash test, an Acceptable rating for the standard pedestrian front crash prevention and a Poor rating for the seat belt reminders. The headlights were rated as Good.
More EV Safety Stuff
In the updated Moderate overlap front crash test, the 2025 Rivian R1S received Good ratings across the board, except for the driver leg/foot protection, where it was rated as Adequate. In this test, the vehicle travels at 40 miles per hour into a stationary barrier with 40% of the vehicle’s front overlapping. There are dummies in the front driver’s seat and the left rear seat, and the non-profit organization measures the impact forces recorded by the dummies during the crash. The IIHS said Rivian made modifications to the front body structure and rear seats to improve occupant safety in frontal crashes.
In the headlights department, where the updated R1S was rated worse than its predecessor, the IIHS said that visibility was good with both the low and high beams but that the low beams created some glare.
To receive a Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS, a vehicle must get a Good rating in the small overlap front test, an Acceptable or Good rating in the updated moderate overlap front test, a Good rating in the updated side test and an Acceptable or Good rating for both the headlights and the pedestrian front crash prevention test.
In total, there are 48 vehicles with a Top Safety Pick+ award for this year, including the 2024 Rivian R1T pickup, Tesla Model Y, Genesis Electrified GV70, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Subaru Solterra, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Genesis Electrified G80.",Iulian Dnistran
"Zeekr 7X Electric SUV Lands In Europe Starting At €52,990",https://insideevs.com/news/744747/zeekr-7x-europe-pricing/,"This Geely-owned, Chinese brand has big plans for Europe.",2024-12-17 17:00:00,"Zeekr was founded in China in, 2021 aimed at both local rival Nio and EV juggernaut Tesla. It was conceived as a global brand, and it’s already present outside China, including in Europe. Now, it's opened European order books for its third, and largest, model, the Zeekr 7X.
The 7X is built on the same Geely SEA 800-volt platform as many other of the group’s models, but it’s most similar in size and footprint to the Smart #5. That’s not a coincidence because it’s built on the same PMA2+ variation of the platform as the Smart. For American context, it's about the size of a Honda Prologue. There’s also a sedan equivalent to the 7X, the 007, but it’s unavailable outside China yet.
Deliveries of the 7X are expected to commence around the middle of 2025. There are four available paint options and optional 20-inch wheels that replace the standard 19s. All cars get a standard Nappa leather interior and a large 16-inch infotainment screen. The latter can be complemented by a 36.2-inch augmented reality head-up display.
The Zeekr 7X can be ordered in Europe with either a 75-kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack, which gives the vehicle a claimed WLTP range of 298 miles (480 kilometers), or a 100-kWh NMC pack that extends the range to 382 miles (615 km). Note that WLTP figures tend to be more optimistic than U.S. EPA numbers. The 7X comes as standard with a single permanent magnet synchronous motor delivering 416 horsepower to the rear wheels, allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 6 seconds.
The optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup bumps power to 637 hp, dropping the benchmark sprint time to 3.8 seconds. All variants have the same top speed of 130 mph (210 km/h), and the same 19 cubic feet (539 liters) of trunk space.
Pricing in Europe for the standard model starts at €52,990 ($55,630 at today's exchange rates) and goes up to €55,990 ($58,800) if you spec the larger battery. The Performance AWD version is the most expensive, starting at €62,990 ($66,150), and if you tick all of the options boxes it'll cost around €70,000 ($73,500). It’s considerably cheaper than its Chinese compatriot, the Nio EL7, which is only marginally larger, and has a starting price in Germany of around €74,000 ($77,700).
The other two Zeekr models available in Europe are the €59,940 ($62,950) 001 fastback and the €42,490 ($44,600) X. The latter is Zeekr’s version of the Volvo EX30, sharing its underpinnings, powertrain and battery. Zeekr recently took control of Lynk & Co—another Geely brand—since there was some overlap between the two.
We recently drove a Zeekr 7X in China and we'll have a review of it here shortly. Spoiler alert: We really liked it.

It Begins: Honda And Nissan Reportedly Starting Merger Talks,https://www.motor1.com/news/744769/honda-nissan-merger-talks-rumor/,The two will allegedly operate under a new holding company.,2024-12-25 01:25:05,"Nissan and Honda are reportedly about to begin talks of merging. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, which cites no specific sources, the two will operate under a new holding company, with the specific details to be decided later. The new group will also allegedly look to include Mitsubishi in the future.
Nissan and Honda began working together in March 2024, expanding their partnership in August to include Mitsubishi as the three agreed to develop electric vehicles and software jointly. Nissan owns a 24 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
Neither Nissan nor Honda would confirm the report's allegations to Reuters, telling the publication that the two are ""exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths.""
And Nissan certainly needs the help.
This year has not been kind to the Japanese automaker, with the company cutting production of its best-selling vehicle while asking dealers to sell cars at a loss. Late last month, two unnamed executives told the Financial Times that the company only had 12 to 14 months to survive. Nissan recently tapped former Jeep CEO Christian Meunier to serve as chairman of Nissan America.
The automotive industry is facing unprecedented challenges. There's more competition, more change, and less certainty than ever before. Chinese automakers are edging out Western brands in their home market, with some beginning to see real sales gains in Europe and elsewhere. Electrification is another considerable point of disruption, where the industry is chasing Chinese progress, forcing traditional automakers to get creative to stay competitive.

The Dodge Charger Daytona Can't Do A Burnout,https://insideevs.com/news/744640/dodge-charger-daytona-cant-burnout/,"Well, this is a little embarrassing.",2024-12-17 16:00:00,"The Dodge Charger Daytona is out and the first reviews are finally hitting the streets. Critics seem to love the car, mostly, especially since it's one of the first performance EVs specifically aimed at roping in gearheads away from gas-powered, tire-slaying, row-your-own combustion cars. That's not an easy feat, but as many of those who have already made the switch can tell you—the instant torque delivered by an EV can be far from tame.
But there's one particular quirk about the Charger Daytona that we can't quite overcome. Despite Dodge marketing the Charger as an electrified muscle car, it lacks the ability to perform of the most basic hooning features that any red-blooded, high-performance American coupe should be able to do: a burnout.
News of the missing feature first came to us while skimming through MotorTrend's first drive review of the Charger Daytona. During their time with the car, MotorTrend noticed that (for some unfathomable reason) it was impossible to get the car to do a burnout. No amount of fiddling with the controls and gas pedal could yield a brakestand.
Here's what caught our eye from MotorTrend:
In fact, the Charger Daytona won’t do a burnout. No matter what we tried, the electric Charger stubbornly rejected our efforts to announce its arrival to the world via smoke signals. It’s probably capable of doing one with a line lock feature, but inexplicably that’s the one toy Dodge failed to program in.
Surely that can't be right.
Dodge, the company that just said it was going to save the world from ""lame, soulless, weak-looking, self-driving, sleep-pods"" by giving the world a battery-powered muscle car, wouldn't have made it so that flagship EV was incapable of spinning its rear tires in an impressive cloud of vaporized rubber... right?
Maybe there's a good reason for it. Let's remember here that the Charger Daytona comes exclusively in all-wheel drive. That means dual 335-horsepower motors at the front and rear wheels, creating a combined output of 670 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of instant, electrified torque. That's plenty of power for some big number 11s on the pavement.
We dug into this quirk a bit more to find out exactly what was going on. As mentioned, the Charger Daytona is AWD, so in order to do a traditional burnout, it would need to cut power to the front wheels—which it should be able to do since an EV doesn't need to mechanically separate the front and rear drivetrains given that they are completely separate from one another.
Dodge calls this feature ""Line Lock""—a term that's been around since mid-century in the drag racing scene. Its name is quite literal and refers to locking pressure in the front brake lines of a car to keep pads in contact with the rotors and prevent the front wheels from turning. The driver can then mash the gas pedal and heat up the rear tires before sending the car down the drag strip.
The idea is similar for the Charger Daytona. Turning the feature on would disable power to the front motor to prevent the wheels from turning, lock the front brakes and let the rear motor unleash its full torque output.Hell, Dodge even brags about the ability to ""add in Line Lock for smoky burnouts"" on the website for the Charger Daytona.
But there's just one problem: the Charger Daytona doesn't have the Line Lock feature. In fact, a Stellantis spokesperson confirmed to InsideEVs that Line Lock is not currently available on the Charger Daytona and that the brand didn't have anything to share regarding any future plans for the feature.
Well, folks, I hate to break it to you, but that's the world we're living in. The Dodge Charger Daytona—the world's first mass-produced modern electric muscle car—can't do a burnout. At least not yet, and whether or not it will get an update to add Dodge's Line Lock feature in the future is anybody's guess.
Sure, it can do other cool things. Drift mode gets rowdy and even performs the decoupling of the front electric drive motor. That makes it even more puzzling that Line Lock isn't available for this same function. I know this isn't the end of the world, but it seems like such a missed opportunity to include a basic muscle car feature on what is being marketed as the first modern electric muscle car. Maybe that'll change in the future, but for now, I'm going to go sit in the corner and wonder what we did to deserve this.

"This $15,000 Nissan Kei Car Is Japan's Best-Selling EV",https://insideevs.com/news/744749/nissan-sakura-review/,It's nice to see a cheap car winning.,2024-12-17 15:00:06,"There's a reason Americans seem increasingly fascinated with Japanese Kei vehicles: It's amazing to see small cars winning. The past two decades have seen Americans completely scorn anything small, cheap and simple, moving towards ever-bigger, ever-more ""premium"" options. That's why our three best-selling EVs are all made by Tesla, a premium brand that claims to be an AI company first. One of them starts at $80,000. In Japan, things are different. The best-selling EV is a $15,000 city car from Nissan.
The Nissan Sakura is a ""Kei"" vehicle, a Japanese designation for vehicles that meet strict size, power and engine displacement rules. That means its power is capped—like all Kei vehicles—at 63 hp, and length is capped at 11 feet, 2 inches. So the Sakura is about 11 feet long, 4.8 feet wide and 5.4 feet tall.
It weighs just under 2,400 lbs, with a 20.0-kWh battery that allows it to go 111 miles on a charge. Note that's a WLTP figure, which tends to be a lot more generous than the EPA cycle used in the U.S. It can charge from 10-80% in about 20 minutes, though, so you can replenish range quickly. There's even vehicle-to-load functionality for powering external electronics.
The Sakura is also super nimble and super cheap. Its turning circle is just 15 feet, and prices start around $15,000 at current exchange rates, with well-optioned examples close to $20,000. You can get it in 15 different color schemes, with two-tone options that add some spunk. It looks cheerful and fun, and Japanese buyers don't seem to look down on small cars the way Americans do.
That's made the Sakura a winning proposition. Our reviewer liked it when he drove it back in 2023, and a new video from AutoTrader U.K. seems to agree. Host Rory Reid—formerly of Top Gear fame—calls it ""delightful."" No wonder Nissan sold 37,140 of them in Japan last year, per Wards Auto, accounting for nearly half of all EV sales in the country. The company had to stop taking orders at one point because demand was so strong.
Reid argues that the Sakura could win some hearts and minds in the U.K. or Europe, but that conversation is purely theoretical. Nissan only sells the Sakura in Japan, and has no plans to expand it for now. It's no surprise that it won't come to the U.S. Tiny, 63-hp Kei cars are not great for America's highway-heavy infrastructure, and cars with under 100 miles of EPA range have typically faired poorly here. Plus, even the city cars better suited to American highways—including the Honda Fit, Mitsubishi Mirage and Ford Fiesta—have all been killed off here.
We don't deserve the Sakura. But Europe does. Reid is right that there's a real opportunity for Nissan to win over some buyers there. It's unlikely to be the sort of smashing success it is in Japan, but Europe has a notable appetite for city cars, and Nissan has a notable dearth of exciting products. It's finally got a winner in its hand, now it just needs to double down.

Jaguar’s Secret Weapon For Selling Its Controversial New EVs: Podcasts,https://insideevs.com/news/744715/jaguar-new-ev-podcast-ownership-experience/,"“People buy cars for their design and interior. Powertrain is about 13th on the list,” said Rawdon Glover, Jaguar’s managing director.",2024-12-17 14:00:25,"It’s safe to say that Jaguar’s reincarnation is quite controversial. From the initial advertising campaign that had precisely zero cars in it to the bulky, muscular pink concept car revealed recently–it’s a stark contrast to what Jaguar used to be.
But it’s all on purpose, as the British automaker’s managing director said in an exclusive interview with TopGear. Not necessarily because Jag was in a bit of a slump, but because customers wanted something different. ""The clients told us you've got to change the brand and the whole ownership experience,” said Rawdon Glover, Jaguar’s MD.
We’re talking about muscular, raw-looking all-electric cars that have very little–if everything–in common with the maker that used to be known for models like the I-Pace, XJ and classic E-Type. Jag even took a sort of sabbatical year off before producing a single car from its all-new lineup, so expectations are very high. The mentality behind selling cars also needs a fresh start, but how will that entail, exactly?
More Jaguar Stories
Podcasts, believe it or not, will play a big part in convincing people that a new electric Jaguar will be worth their attention and hard-earned money. ""Buyers want to be treated like an insider. They'll have podcasts of Gerry [McGovern, design head], our engineers, access to information that they wouldn't otherwise get. They're joining a community."" That sounds good in theory, but we’ll have to wait and see how it pans out.
The design will also play a major role in Jag’s reinvention. ""We think there's white space not just in price, but for a brand that's being more disruptive,” Glover said for TopGear. “People buy cars for their design and interior. Powertrain is about 13th on the list."" As a reminder, Jaguar’s upcoming grand tourer will cost around $150,000, slotting between the Lucid Air and Rolls-Royce Spectre. ""They're going to buy it because they think it's beautiful and the brand resonates,"" added Jaguar’s managing director.
Sticking with the design theme, Glover had some cheeky comments about competitors’ choices, saying that many EVs today look like bars of soap because of aerodynamics. “You end up with vehicles that don't have emotional resonance,” said Glover. “We've made the antidote. It's completely different. It's going to have incredible presence on the road.""",Iulian Dnistran
Is Tesla Model S Free Lifetime Supercharging Deal Worth It?,https://insideevs.com/news/744613/tesla-model-s-lifetime-supercharging/,"The Model S now comes with free Supercharging for life, but at the cost of a raised price tag. Let's figure out if it's worth the extra",2024-12-17 13:00:23,"Tesla is really pushing the Model S hard this holiday season. While the car has never been a volume seller like the Model 3 and Model Y, it's Tesla's OG luxury sedan—and an impressive one at that. But more and more competition for luxury EVs has entered the market over the last few years, and Tesla's take-rate is down by an estimated 30% or more. That means that selling customers on the Model S over rivals has been more of a chore for Tesla than before.
Recently, Tesla decided to pull the gloves off and use its biggest asset to its advantage: the Supercharging network. Tesla dug deep into its old playbooks and revived the unlimited lifetime Supercharging perk, which means that the buyer of a new Model S would get—you guessed it—free unlimited Supercharging for as long as they own the Model S. But before Tesla did that, it also raised the price of the Model S from $74,990 to $79,990 ($5,000) late last week. That makes us wonder: is the deal really as good as it sounds?
To figure it out, we did some basic napkin math. Before we dig into the numbers, we need to know just how efficient the Model S is (at least on paper). The EPA efficiency of the 2024 Tesla Model S All Wheel Drive is 3.6 miles per kilowatt-hour. The Model S Plaid with 21-inch wheels is less efficient at 2.8 miles/kWh.
The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 86% of EV owners have access to a home charger. Of those owners, the agency estimates that approximately 80% of all charging is performed at home. Looking at my own charging stats for the past year, 83% of my charging was done at home—so let's assume the DoE's figures are correct.
The Federal Highway Administration says that the average driver puts around 13,476 miles on their car each year (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm), which means that the average Model S would use around 3,743 kWh of electricity. Only 749 kWh of that energy would be from Supercharging, according to the DoE's figures.
Tesla doesn't list its average base rate for Supercharging, but a quick look around its map has rates ranging from $0.25 to $0.60 per kWh. Let's average that out to $0.43/kWh. For 749 kWh of electricity, the average owner would spend around $322 per year on Supercharging. This means that it would take 15.5 years of driving to fully realize the $5,000 cost hike with the lifetime of free Supercharging. Anything after that would be a net positive, as long as you don't take depreciation into account.
Now, let's talk about that in miles. For the drivers who adhere to the 80-20 charging split and travel the national average, the cost savings start to kick in when the car hits around 210,000 miles on the odometer. Can a Model S do that? Sure—and then some. But the real value here is for those 14%-ers who don't have access to charging at home. That $5,000 price hike starts to pay for itself in just 42,000 miles of Supercharger-only driving.
Now, sure, there are going to be some folks who decide that they'll use this perk to exclusively Supercharge their car. According to the DoE's projections, that could account for as much as 14% of owners right off the bat. If these owners would charge all 3,743 kWh from Superchargers, it would mean a savings of around $1,610 per year, which achieves cost-neutrality in just over three years. Over the same length of 15.5 years, someone who charges their 2024 Model S AWD would have a savings of around $19,950 after the $5,000 price hike.
So, is it worth it? Well, that's for you to decide. If you've been looking at a Model S and don't mind paying the extra price for the unlimited Supercharging trade-off, then, sure. But be warned: unlimited Supercharging is bound only to that vehicle under one person's account, so it won't transfer with the sale of the vehicle. It also doesn't include idle fees or congestion fees and Tesla says it can revoke free Supercharging ""in the event of excessive charging""—so maybe don't hinge making your entire car payment on driving for Uber or Lyft.",Rob Stumpf
Lamborghini Is Delaying Its First EV Like Everyone Else,https://www.motor1.com/news/744579/lamborghini-delays-first-ev-2029/,The production-ready Lanzador will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028.,2024-12-25 01:25:08,"Several automakers within the last year have altered their electrification plans. Slowing growth is forcing companies like Volvo, Bentley, Ford, and others to reconsider their strategies and rejigger their launch schedules, including Lamborghini. The Italian company now plans to delay the launch of its first EV by a year, according to the CEO.
Lamborghini boss Stephan Winkelmann told reporters this week that the EV will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028, according to Reuters. Winkelmann said he did not believe 2029 was too late to launch an EV, adding that the company does not think the segment will be ready for EVs by 2026.
The automaker is also waiting for potential changes to the European Union’s combustion engine ban set for 2035, when a review takes place in 2026. Lamborghini has also expressed interest in the potential for synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines in new vehicles.
""We think this is the right way to face the future,"" Winkelmann said. ""There are discussions around synthetic fuels and this is an opportunity for our kind of cars"".
The automaker’s first EVs won’t be a supercar. Instead, it’ll be a four-seat grand tourer previewed by the Lanzador concept in 2023. Winkelmann said earlier this year that electric supercars weren’t selling well, and might never truly entice consumers.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X Just Got A Lot Cheaper,https://insideevs.com/news/744726/2025-toyota-bz4x-pricing-specs/,"Toyota's sole U.S. electric vehicle is up to $6,000 less expensive for 2025.",2024-12-17 11:30:00,"I think that it's fair at this point to say the Toyota bZ4X has a bit of a reputation. The sole electric offering in the U.S. from Toyota, itself an electric-car skeptic, has less range and slower charging speeds than many comparable rivals. But if you want an EV from a trusted brand and you're after a good deal, the bZ4X has consistently proven to be a solid choice.
Mere days after announcing some aggressive new lease and 0% financing deals—the latter of which are nearly impossible to find in the current economic climate—Toyota revealed the 2025 bZ4X's pricing and features. While it didn't get the boost in charging speeds or range that many fans wanted, it's now quite a bit cheaper.
As before, the bZ4X comes in two trim levels: XLE or the loaded Limited. Both can be had in front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive forms with up to 252 or 228 miles of range, respectively. But now there's also a Nightshade trim in the middle that adds 20-inch black alloy wheels, available two-tone paint, a heated steering wheel and other all-black touches. This trim level ""adds more standard driver assistance technology on the Limited grade including Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist and Front Cross Traffic Alert,"" Toyota said in a news release. The Nightshade trim is also AWD-only.
2025 Toyota bZ4X Nightshade Edition
The real news here is pricing. The basic XLE FWD starts at $37,070, which is 14% cheaper than last year's model. The XLE AWD grade’s MSRP starts at $39,150 now too. That's about $6,000 less expensive than before. Moreover, the Limited grade starts at $41,800 in FWD form, cutting $5,380 off the old car's price tag.
All told, this puts the bZ4X on par with a nicely-equipped RAV4 Hybrid and slightly cheaper than a RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid, and on par with your average gas RAV4's pricing. The bZ4X has seen a series of price cuts since its debut in 2022, and now may be the best time to get one.
But that's only part of the story. We consistently see impressive lease and regional discounts and deals on the bZ4X, so if you are after one, do your homework—you could end up paying even less than the official new pricing.
2025 Toyota bZ4X
The bZ4X is limited by its so-so technology and mid-tier fast-charging speeds, which max out at 150 kW. The EV should charge from ""a low battery warning"" to 80% in about 30 minutes, but some users have reported taking about an hour to do so. It also won't automatically add charging stops to your route on longer trips, or allow you to precondition the battery for charging. On the plus side, it's a surprisingly fun-to-drive electric crossover that's dynamically much more interesting than your average RAV4, and it's pretty capable for gear-hauling.
Keep an eye on the deals in your area if you're interested in the bZ4X. You may just be able to wrangle a solid-driving EV for not a lot of money, especially when you factor in gas savings.

Trump Pitches A Complete U-Turn On Federal Support For EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/744636/trump-ev-policy-changes-2025/,"Plus, automakers slash EV prices to meet EU targets and Mercedes reflects on its shrinking market share in China.",2024-12-17 10:54:56,"As Biden's presidential term comes to an end, the torch is being placed back into Trump's hands for the next four years. The incoming administration's transition team is readying a sweeping set of policy changes that are more akin to a U-Turn than fostering progress, and a huge focus of the Trump team is on electric cars. Unlike the Biden administration, Trump isn't so hot on the idea of subsidizing the EV industry, and that means a number of policy changes could undo the headway made by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Trump's official plans for EVs during his incoming term, the surprising strategy automakers are taking to meet EU's 2025 emissions requirements, and a glimpse into what happens if Mercedes can't grow market share in China. Let's Jump in.
After weeks of speculation and what-ifs following the U.S. presidential election, the future of the country's EV strategy has finally been spelled out in black and white.
Reuters recently got an exclusive look at the recommendations drawn up by president-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Let's just say it's a masterclass in ripping up the roadmap, lighting it on fire and then burying it in the backyard. The plans include cutting off federal support for EVs and charging infrastructure, tariffs on critical battery materials and rolling back emission standards that have been pushing the envelope forward on EV adoption.
First up is the call to eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit. Rumors of this being on the chopping block have existed for months, but it seems all but written in stone now. While this will undoubtedly hurt some consumers by making models unaffordable at full price, it's also pulling the rug out from underneath of automakers that have already invested billions by breaking ground on domestic factories just to qualify for the tax credit.
Domestic-ification is still clearly important. The team says that it plans to recommend tariffs on battery materials from all countries—not just China—in an attempt to boost domestic production. Reuters says that the document recommends negotiating individual exemptions with certain trading partners.
It doesn't stop there, either. That critical funding being used to prop up the nation's EV charging infrastructure? Gone. Instead, the incoming administration is recommending that that money be redirected to national-defense priorities like securing battery minerals and components independent of China. The Trump team is sending a clear signal that defense priorities are a non-negotiable while the consumer side of EVs will just work itself out.
And, of course, there's the rollback of emission standards. The Trump team is reportedly looking to revoke the fuel economy standards set under the Biden administration, and will allow for 25% more tailpipe emissions. California is also set to lose its ability to set clean air regulations for the states that follow its guidance across the country, assuming the administration can win what will surely be a long court battle on that front.
This all spells bad news for the accelerated adoption of EVs across the country. Consumers are left to fend for themselves to drive up adoption while automakers, who have already lit piles of cash on fire to align with the outgoing administration's guidance, have seeming done it for naught. As for manufacturing, automakers have been preparing for a domestic focus on electrification, but the supply chain might not be ready for the shock about to be imposed on it.
Buckle up, folks, because the next chapter of the move to EVs is going to be bumpy.
Europe's automakers are in a tough spot right now. Europe's new carbon dioxide emission rules go into effect next month. That means shuffling the deck to ensure they sell more EVs and fewer ICE cars to reach a fleet-wide ratio that puts them in compliance with new rules—and it looks like it's resulting in a surprising benefit to would-be EV buyers.
The new emission requirements dictate specific fleet-wide CO2 targets that automakers need to achieve  by next year in order to avoid racking up heavy penalties. This means hitting a sales ratio of at least 20% EV-to-ICE. The problem is, automakers aren't anywhere near that just yet. In fact, EV sales made up just 13% of new passenger car sales in Europe in 2024 so far. So with shrinking subsidies and weak demand for battery power, car manufacturers know they need to take drastic measures.
Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault have all taken on the same strategy to become compliant: lower EV prices. I know that sounds like a no brainer, but it comes with an asterisk. Not only are EV prices going down, but combustion prices are going up. That means lowering the barrier of entry to electrification and narrowing the gap to achieve closer price parity for the consumer. The hope is that this is enough to push on-the-fence buyers into enough EVs to hit that sweet 20% target.
This plan has been seemingly in the works for months. For example, Volkswagen lowered the price of the all-electric ID.3 below $31,500 (30,000 EUR) in October with the caveat that all new purchases would be delivered after January 1st—after the new rules take affect. However, these types of discounts are projected to hit automaker's bottom line hard. It's estimated that these discounts alone could cost the industry a combined $5.1 billion.
As for price hikes, we're not talking thousands, here. Renault and Peugeot recently hiked the price of some gas powertrains a few hundred Euros while keeping hybrid prices steady, which is likely a similar approach that other OEMs will take. It would seem that automakers may not just be looking to incentivize EV sales, but also hedge their bets just in case that emission target can't be met.
After all, for every 1 gram of CO2 per kilometer over Europe's threshold, automakers will be fined roughly $100 (95 EUR) per vehicle sold.
In theory, using a consumer's wallet to influence their purchasing decisions is a proven tactic. Everybody loves a good deal, and those who have been considering an EV but wary over higher prices may decide that it's finally time to bite the bullet as price parity grows closer—even if that happens artificially. But for automakers this isn't about starting a price war. They can choose to either light money on fire by paying regulatory fines, or light money on fire to achieve a greater road presence with its EVs. Which would you choose?
Mercedes-Benz is losing its footing in the Chinese EV market. That probably sounds familiar, and it should considering that China's domestic auto market has exploded over the last decade. Many non-Chinese players are quickly finding out that they can't easily compete against even the newest players that have entered the market. Now Mercedes' works council chief says that a failure to regain this crucial market could be a ""fatal"" blow to the brand.
""We would not be satisfied with any less than two million cars a year—we need that to use our German sites to capacity,"" Mercedes works council chief Ergun Lumali told local news on Monday. ""It would be fatal if we as a company relied on significantly lower numbers in the long-term.""
Lumali's two million figure refers to the brand's total annual passenger vehicle output, which is down 14.3% from its 2019 sales figures of nearly 2.4 million units. Mercedes' global sales have been declining since that peak, the only exception being a slight uptick of 3,300 units year-over-year in 2023. Analysts believe that one of the main reasons the brand is seeing a decrease in sales is weakness in the Chinese EV market, its sales training behind other luxury marques like BMW.
CEO Ola Kaellenius planned for lower volumes. In 2020, Kaellenius made the decision to push Mercedes more upmarket. This was expected to cut costs up to 20% by 2025, which would help to pad profits while cutting down on overall sales volume. Unfortunately, that seems to have backfired, as luxury EVs haven't taken off like Kaellenius projected, especially since domestic manufacturers are offering more bang-for-buck when compared to luxury imports from Germany and elsewhere.
""We need growth, growth, growth,"" said Lumali, pointing blame at leadership's misguided plans. ""New strategies are needed.""
Here's the thing—it's not just luxury names that are suffering. Even blue-collar U.S. brands like General Motors have found that China is becoming so competitive that it had to take a $5 billion hit. Japanese brands are struggling too as they've been absolutely trounced by China's home-grown EV manufacturers over the past few quarters. The stronghold that global brands have on China is flatlining and that's a big, big problem for the brands that rely on the market for a vast majority of their sales volume.
Mercedes sold just under 1.5 million cars during the first three quarters of 2024. It expects to close out the year with less than its 2023 sales of 2,043,800 units—and as Lumali pointed out, if the brand wants to keep factory output at a sustainable level for workers and income, it needs to find a strategy that increases volume substantially in a very short time.
With the Trump transition team's plans being all but solidified, it seems that EV buying is transitioning into a seller's market for...well, for as long as the EV incentives like the EV tax credit can be utilized. While the team itself hasn't expressed when it plans to recommend these changes, Trump has made his desire to clear that his intention is to move forward with administrative policy changes very early on after inauguration.
This puts the purchase of a new EV on a time clock for many buyers. And for others—maybe those who don't need a new car but would like one—if they don't act sooner rather than later, they could miss out on a $7,500 discount.
So will you move forward with a new EV purchase in the near future given these policy changes? Let me know in the comments.

Honda Prelude Hybrid Will Come To The U.S. In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/744630/honda-prelude-confirmed-producton-coupe/,Honda says the hybrid coupe will bring the fun back to driving with S+ Shift. And Americans won't be missing out.,2024-12-17 10:00:42,"We don’t always talk about non-plug-in hybrids here at InsideEVs, but when it happens, it's usually for a good reason. The Honda Prelude Concept was one of those “good reasons”. Last year, Honda surprised everyone at the Toyko Auto Salon (and again at the LA Auto Show) with a thinly-veiled hybrid coupe concept wearing a familiar name.
This year, Honda surprises us again, just in time for Christmas. Honda’s sporty coupe will be making a return for sure, by late next year—including to the U.S. market. Hallelujah.
The Prelude will be more than just a Civic-based hybrid coupe, though. Honda says that this model will mark a new start of performance-oriented sport hybrid technology, through a feature called “S+ Shift”. We don’t know much about the explicit details, but Honda says it will “advance Linear Shift Control to deliver maximum levels of driver engagement, in keeping with the heritage of the Prelude line.”
From that description, I can’t help but think it could be a production version of Honda’s virtual shifting program I saw this past fall in Tokyo. Honda had it applied on a prototype Honda E, but it was open about its plans to port this gamified tech to other future models in its stable.
Like other Honda hybrids, the Prelude will use the same two-motor gas-electric hybrid system. In this design, a traditional automatic or manual transmission isn’t really possible. But, because the two-motor system has a lot of versatility in how it uses its large electric motors in lieu of a transmission, it should mean that a true PHEV isn’t necessarily out of the question. In many European markets, the CR-V Hybrid is available as a PHEV. Similarly, the Accord Hybrid is also PHEV in China. Could a Prelude PHEV be a simple jump away? Maybe.
Regardless, the Prelude comes at a historic time for Honda. Honda is celebrating the 25 year anniversary of its first hybrid car, the Insight. It also recognized that the Prelude was integral to Honda’s original 1970’s launch.
“The first three products in the Honda lineup in the 1970s were Civic, Accord and Prelude, and soon all three will be back together again in our passenger car lineup as hybrids,"" said Jessika Laudermilk, assistant vice president of Honda Auto Sales.
Honda is still calling the Prelude a concept, but it did send over a few new images of the coupe pained up in a very appropriately festive red. Expect the production model to look pretty close to what we see here when it goes on sale next year.

French Government Slashes EV Incentives Amidst Budget Constraints,https://www.rideapart.com/news/744270/france-slashes-ev-incentives-budget-constraints/,"Electric cars have their subsidies reduced, but EV two-wheelers and micro-mobility devices lose them altogether.",2024-12-25 01:25:09,"Recent years have seen a massive boom in electric mobility, particularly electric motorcycles and scooters. It was a two-way arrangement, really, as manufacturers were eager to jump on an emerging trend. Meanwhile, governments all over the world were quick to incentivize these EVs in a bid to encourage more sustainable mobility.
Unfortunately, the landscape has changed quite a bit. And now, we’re seeing a lot of e-bike, e-scooter, and e-motorcycle manufacturers go under. It also looks like things for the lightweight EV sector aren’t getting any better, at least not just yet.
You see, over in France, the government just rolled out Decree No. 2024-1084, and it’s one that’ll surely have EV enthusiasts disgruntled. The new decree covers quite a lot of electric mobility options ranging from cars to motorcycles and even bicycles, but in a nutshell, it either significantly reduces or completely eliminates the government subsidy for the purchase of electric vehicles.
EV adopters could previously enjoy subsidies of up to 7,000 euros for the purchase of an electric car.
When it comes to new electric passenger cars, the subsidy will now only be from 2,000 euros to 4,000 euros (about US $2,098 to $4,196), as against the previous 4,000 euros to 7,000 euros (about $4,196 to $7,343)—quite a hit for folks looking to save a few bucks by going electric.
But it gets worse.
The new decree completely removes the incentive, also known as an ecological bonus, for both electric two- and three-wheeled vehicles. Electric bicycles, like the super utilitarian e-cargo bikes and ultra-practical electric commuter bikes, are part of the equation, too. And apart from being a total wet blanket for active mobility enthusiasts, this could have a massive negative effect on the European bicycle industry.
Indeed, industry experts were quick to point out that what the government has done is essentially a death sentence to many up and coming e-bike manufacturers that have called France home. Back in 2017, when the subsidies were first introduced, the bicycle market saw a doubling of sales, as bikes—both electric and otherwise—became more accessible than ever before.
Electric cargo bikes have grown in popularity in France and other parts of Europe.
In an article by Bike Europe, the Alliance for Cycling expressed its disdain on the elimination of subsidies for electric two-wheelers in France. In a statement, it said: “The subsidy program is crucial for the cycling industry in France which is making significant steps forward to relocate the production. The bicycle industry is currently in difficulty, with a 24 percent decline in bicycle production volumes in France compared to 2022, and bicycle sales are down by 13 percent.”
And as for why the French government is slashing its EV incentives all of a sudden, well, according to Reuters, the move is part of a wider range of initiatives geared to control additional expenses due to budgeting constraints moving into 2025. It’s a bad situation that’s making an already unfavorable situation worse for pretty much the entire EV industry.
What’s scary here is that governments, organizations, and businesses alike all over the world are always looking for ways to cut costs. And perhaps, France cutting EV subsidies sets a massive precedent for other countries to follow suit. We’re expecting a similar move in the US—perhaps one that’s even worse, once Trump takes office on January 20, 2025.
So, to any EV enthusiasts reading this story, it certainly looks like things are gonna get a bit more difficult for you guys in the near future. If you're in France, or you otherwise have thoughts about this change in policy, share them in the comments below.

"Fisker, A Bankrupt Automaker, Sold More EVs Than Volkswagen In October",https://insideevs.com/news/744704/fisker-sold-more-evs-volkswagen-october-usa/,"It sounds like a glitch in The Matrix, but there’s a logical explanation.",2024-12-17 08:21:28,"October was a great month for several automakers. General Motors and Hyundai, for instance, saw big gains in registrations. Meanwhile, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Rivian’s R1S and Tesla’s Model Y were down double digits.
But while checking out the registration data for all EVs in the United States–you can read more about the bigger picture here–I noticed something peculiar. Toward the bottom of the list, two unlikely names were battling it out, and the winner of this bottom-of-the-barrel competition was surprising.
According to registration data from S&P Mobility Global, Fisker moved more electric vehicles than Volkswagen. As a reminder, Fisker went bankrupt earlier this year and its liquidation plan was approved by a judge in October. Meanwhile, Volkswagen is one of the largest carmakers in the world. So how did we get here?
More Stuff Like This
Let’s look at the numbers first. Fisker had 110 EVs registered in the U.S. in October, while Volkswagen had 92. That’s worse than Fiat’s 135 EV registrations but better than Jeep’s 63. It’s not exactly what we’d call outstanding, but there’s an explanation for all of this.
As I mentioned earlier, Fisker’s liquidation was approved by a judge in October. The bankrupt automaker still had roughly 3,000 unsold Ocean electric crossovers in inventory when the plan was approved, and all of them were scooped up by New York-based American Lease. Before the liquidation plan was approved, these cars were still for sale at a handful of dealers across the country, and some of the cars were priced really low. In other words, people could still buy the Ocean EV, often with very high discounts.

2024 Volkswagen ID.4
But what about Volkswagen? For such a large company, VW only sells two electric models in the United States–the American-made ID.4 crossover and the German-made ID.Buzz minivan. However, the ID.Buzz only became available in the U.S. in–you guessed it–October, when the configurator went online. That said, Volkswagen only supplied limited quantities to dealers at the beginning.
That leaves the ID.4, which has traditionally been a solid performer. Volkswagen stopped production of the electric crossover at the Chattanooga plant at the end of September, though. It did that because there’s a recall affecting nearly 100,000 ID.4s in the U.S. for faulty electronic door locks that could open while driving–and there’s no fix. Before stopping production, a stop-sale was issued for the ID.4.
So there you have it. A combination of steep discounts for an EV that’s no longer being manufactured due to the company behind it going bankrupt and a manufacturing pause for an otherwise well-known electric crossover.",Iulian Dnistran
You Can Get A New Fiat 500e With $0 Down And $0 Per Month–With A Catch,https://insideevs.com/news/744664/fiat-500e-0-lease/,"It’s not a scam, even if it sounds too good to be true.",2024-12-17 03:44:51,"The Fiat 500e is a decent electric city car, but it has one big downside: its price tag. For about $34,000, you only get 141 miles of range, two doors and four seats, which isn’t exactly enticing when the Chevrolet Equinox EV exists. It’s bigger, has more range and costs about the same when you factor in the $7,500 tax credit.
However, there’s a lease deal for the Fiat 500e out there that beats just about everything on the market, simply because it’s free–with an asterisk.
Thanks to tax credits, you can lease the Italian electric supermini with $0 down and $0 per month. If you live in Colorado. And have a credit score above 700. And you also need to consider the sales tax and insurance, but that’s also valid for any other lease out there, so no surprise here.
More Fiat 500e Stories
There’s also just one dealer in Colorado that has this offer, as far as we know, which is even more restrictive for those wanting to get behind the wheel of a brand-new EV for very little money. That said, the maths behind the deal is pretty simple.
When leasing, any new EV is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit. On top of that, the state of Colorado offers an additional $5,000 for new EVs, which brings the incentive total to $12,500. That’s what the dealer is getting, leaving the customer to pay the sales taxes, registration fee and comprehensive insurance.
The Colorado dealer that came up with the $0 lease only has the base Fiat 500e in stock, which comes with automatic air conditioning, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but not much more. The retail price of the car is $34,095 excluding the destination charge. The lease contract is for 27 months and 20,000 miles.
Another added benefit of this deal is customers get a free Level 2 charger or $600 in charging credits. If lessees want to end the lease early, there’s a $395 disposition fee, but that’s about it.
It’s a screaming deal. Yes, the car is not exactly record-breaking by any stretch of the imagination, but for this kind of money, it can be a great little commuter. It’s also worth mentioning that the $7,500 federal tax credit might be going away next year, so keep that in mind if you’re looking for a new EV.",Iulian Dnistran
Shaq Had A Lucid Air Turned Into A Coupe So He Could Fit Inside,https://insideevs.com/news/744608/shaq-lucid-air-coupe-custom/,"When you’re a 7’1’’ former NBA player, normal-sized car doors just don’t cut it.",2024-12-16 15:00:15,"Shaquille O’Neal has done many things in his career that started in professional basketball and continues today in the entertainment and music industries. He’s amassed an impressive collection of cars, some of which have been modified to accommodate his 7’11’’ frame, and the most recent addition is a unique makeover of a Lucid Air.
Shaq’s Air has been turned into a two-door coupe with considerably larger doors than before. The work was done by West Coast Customs (WCC), the shop made famous by the show Pimp My Ride, and it looks like a thorough job considering it involved extensive structural modifications. The former NBA player didn’t say much about his new car other than the fact that he had it personalized to match his Rolls-Royce Cullinan (also done by WCC).
We can’t quite tell if the shape of the roof has been changed—it looks like it probably wasn’t—because the Air actually looks good as a two-door. Some of the other changes made to the vehicle include large, multi-spoke wheels with self-centering caps featuring the Superman logo and the replacement of the “Lucid” script on the front with “Diesel,” referencing his stage name as a dubstep DJ.
This one-of-a-kind Air isn’t Shaq’s only custom EV. He owns at least two Tesla Cybertrucks with custom carbon fiber widebody kits and massive 26-inch Forgiato wheels. Their transformation isn’t as radical as the Lucid Air, since it didn’t involve changing any of the bodywork, but, at the same time, they look quite different from a standard Cybertruck—they will really get Shaq noticed, unlike the Air coupe, which is a lot more understated in comparison.
Elon Musk even commented on one of the Cybertrucks, saying it was “nice” when Shaq posted a photo of it on X. Will Lucid boss Peter Rawlinson take to X to comment on Shaq's two-door Air? Probably not.
Lucid has no plans to make an Air coupe. The personal luxury coupe market has been consistently shrinking over the last decade as more buyers are moving to high-riding SUVs instead. Lucid itself just launched its second model, the Gravity, which unsurprisingly is a three-row SUV because that’s what sells these days.

"Dodge Charger EV Review: 'Sorry, Dodge, Things Are Not Looking Good'",https://insideevs.com/news/744580/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-review/,Kyle Conner from Out of Spec has many issues with the new electric Dodge Charger Daytona.,2024-12-16 14:00:03,"Nobody really asked for an electric muscle car that makes fake V8 noises, but Dodge went ahead and made one anyway. The 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV is here now, and it’s not been getting the best reviews. It doesn’t seem clear who and what it’s designed for since it does some things that you wouldn’t expect well while not performing as well as you think it should in other areas, given its muscle car image.
Kyle Conner from the Out of Spec Reviews channel had a lot of things to say about the new electric Charger, and most of them weren’t flattering. He even apologizes to Dodge at the start of the video for what he’s about to say, but he makes plenty of good points that seem to confirm what other early reviewers have said about the car.
The way it looks is not a problem, especially for the two-door body. Dodge has done an excellent job of making an EV look like a muscle car, including giving it a blunt and upright front end. However, while at first glance it may look like a typical muscle car, it hides an aero element similar to what the Polestar 3 has, which is designed to channel air over the car and improve the drag coefficient.
It’s built on the 400-volt Stellantis STLA Large platform, which allows for both electric and combustion powertrains, and in EV form, it has a battery pack with just over 100 kilowatt-hours of gross capacity. The usable capacity is about 94 kWh, which gives the $59,995 R/T variant on 18-inch wheels an EPA range rating of 308 miles (496 km). The $73,130 Scat Pack with more power and larger wheels is rated at 240 miles.
The range numbers are average when compared to other similar vehicles with comparable batteries, but it is a bit on the heavy side at almost 5,700 pounds (2,585 kg) or more than that for the Scat Pack. That heft makes its presence felt when you want to pick up the pace around a twisty road when the car just feels a bit lethargic and inert—even suddenly flooring reveals a delay until full power is delivered, and it doesn’t help the car feel sporty to drive.
Kyle was not kind to the electric Charger, saying it left him “completely disappointed.” He says it has no redeeming qualities, even pointing to its low-speed driving experience, which, in spite of its heft, is deemed “dreadful.” In his view, this car doesn’t even get the EV basics right, and it has additional problems on top of that, but then again, it’s also a brand-new vehicle, and Dodge can still improve it and add features over time.
We'll draw our own conclusions once we get our hands on a Dodge Charger Daytona for our own in-depth review.

Watch How Fast This EV Swaps Its Battery,https://insideevs.com/news/743429/onvo-l60-swap-video-battery/,The Onvo L60 can swap its batteries for fresh ones far quicker than any DC fast charger.,2024-12-16 13:02:04,"The jury is still out if China (and the rest of the world) is migrating to battery swapping instead of recharging, but I can’t deny that it’s super cool. The complaints about range anxiety related to long waits and long charge times at DC fast chargers vanish because battery swapping is so much faster.
I drove a few new electric vehicles from Nio and its new brand Onvo while in China a few weeks ago. There, I was able to watch and initiate the swaps themselves. This ain’t no joke folks, these batteries swap very quickly — watch in real-time as the car maneuvers itself into the swap station, and removes and replaces its battery — all in less than five minutes.
The car I’m driving in the video is the Onvo L60. Onvo is Nio’s latest brand, a moderately priced EV brand meant for Chinese families. The L60 is tit-for-tat the same size and a direct competitor to the Tesla Model Y. However, unlike the Model Y, the Onvo L60’s batteries can be swapped out instead of charging using Nio’s swap stations.
In this video, I’m at a Generation Four swap station. The first one went online this past summer, but notably, these new generation stations are designed to accommodate a wider range of batteries. The Onvo L60 has a slimmer battery made by BYD and only comes in 60 or 84 kWh, compared to the 75, 100, or 150 kWh found in the more upscale Nio vehicles. Also, Nio says there have been some improvements to the stations themselves. Nio says the swap can now happen in as little as 144 seconds.
It’s a very smooth process. After the car backs itself in, it places itself into neutral and does a quick system check. Then, it cuts the car’s main power (the infotainment screen and blower motor will continue to function), raising the vehicle. The battery is removed, and the car is placed back on its wheels. The automated battery cabinet finds a fresh battery, raises the car once more, and installs it. The car does one more self-check as it’s lowered back onto its wheels. When the car’s speedometer and gear selector reappear, it’s time to drive away.
Onvo L60
If we count from the time it took me to maneuver the car into its space and start the swap process, it took three minutes and 44 seconds for the whole swap to take place, including the time the car spent maneuvering itself into the swap station itself. Before I could grasp what was going on, the L60’s battery swap was complete. Even the fastest DC fast charging couldn’t beat this. This might be faster than the last time I got gas. It’s no 144 seconds, but man, it’s pretty damn quick.
Of course, not every swap is perfect. It took me two tries to actually get the car into the swap cabinet, mostly because an impatient driver cut me off while the car was attempting to back itself into the swap station, forcing me to restart the entire process. Still, it’s very impressive.
So, what do you think? Do you want your next EV to have a swappable battery?

Would You Camp Out In This Weird Electric Camper Trike Thing?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/744117/grounded-t1-electric-camper-trike/,"An interesting concept, but one that might be a little too ahead of its time.",2024-12-25 01:25:13,"I want you to imagine a scenario in the distant future. A future where the great outdoors is no longer a reality, but just an illusion—one that’s constructed within the confines of the underground civilization mankind has built to escape the nuclear apocalypse. Naturally, outdoor recreational things like camping, hiking, and overlanding have become a thing of the past.
But it’s human nature to long for the good old days, and so folks inhabiting this underground settlement have created simulated outdoor environments complete with trees, dirt, and mountains in the distance. Sure, off-roaders and 4x4s are now a thing of the past, but that doesn’t mean that campers need to go extinct. This is where this crazy e-trike camper from a company called Grounded enters the picture.
It’s called the T1, and it’s essentially an electric trike that’s pulling a trailer that doubles as a camper. It’s powered by the Civilized Cycles Semi-Trike platform, and is touted as a first-of-its-kind smart trailer and trike system. So yeah, definitely perfect for camping trips that are confined to a pretty close radius, and without much off-road riding.
Where’s the fun in that?
It boasts a well-appointed cabin with all the essentials.
You get a dining table for two, a sink and counter, and even an optional outdoor shower.
Inside, the Grounded T1 boasts all the amenities you’d hope to find in a mobile home. The concept render features what appears to be a modular dining and living space with enough room to seat two to three adults. At night, the table looks like it could be folded up, and the seats look like they could be turned into a cozy bed for two. There’s a sink, a counter, and even an optional dry-flush toilet and outdoor shower. Heck, you could pretty much live in this thing.
And while this thing just might work in the context of a distant dystopian future, at present, I’m not quite sure who this is actually for.
I mean, on paper, this thing certainly seems capable. It claims a range in excess of 150 miles. It even gets solar panels bolted to the roof, as well as compatibility with Starlink. Heck, you can even control all its features through a proprietary app. [How very 2024!jj]
The main drawback here seems to be that it's confined to pavement and bike paths.
But to be compatible with today’s definition of adventure, the T1 needs just a little bit more capability, at least in my opinion. For starters, it’ll need higher ground clearance in order to be able to tackle any trails or rut-laden gravel roads. It might also need some extra suspension to soak up the bumps, too. On Grounded’s official website, it shows renders of the T1 riding solely on paved bike paths. And while more and more of these are popping up all over the world, there’s no denying that lots of adventurers still want to have the option to go well beyond the confines of pavement.
Oh, and for a starting MSRP of $13,000 USD, it’ll be hard to convince adventurers looking to get the most bang for their buck to splurge on this electric camper trike. Heck, you could get yourself a 2004 Toyota Tacoma for that cash, and still have some dough left over to dress it up with some overland goodies.
But hey, that’s just me. And who knows, maybe there will be a place for an electric camper like the Grounded T1? Maybe even long before the nuclear apocalypse.

How Mercedes’ Craziest Experiment Gave Us Its Most Important EV Yet,https://insideevs.com/news/744433/mercedes-cla-eqxx-technology/,A Mercedes-Benz engineer tells us how the learnings from the record-breaking EQXX led to the upcoming CLA sedan.,2024-12-16 11:00:06,"Almost three years ago now, Mercedes-Benz showed off something that seemed capable of doing the impossible. Dubbed the Vision EQXX, it had the same size battery as a Mercedes EQS, just 30% lighter and taking up half as much space. Its electric motor was much smaller than most with its power output. It was aerodynamic enough to make a fighter jet look like a school bus.
Put all those innovations together, and Mercedes had a car that could drive 747 miles on a single charge—yes, really—or 627 miles in the heat of a Saudi Arabian desert. And it delivered groundbreaking electric efficiency of up to 8.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, almost twice as good as today’s best EVs.
Mercedes Vision EQXX
At other automakers, this project would have stayed a mere science experiment. Not so at Mercedes-Benz, where one of its top engineers recently told me the car’s technology will directly translate to its most important EV yet: the new CLA-Class.
Timo Stegmaier, Mercedes head of e-drive compact/midsize and system validation, also worked on Mercedes-Benz's groundbreaking EQXX project and has been responsible for bringing many of the learnings from there into the almost production-ready CLA.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
""The world-record EQXX, it was very important for us with the car to influence series production,"" Stegmaier said of the long-tailed prototype machine. ""It was really nice not only doing a showcase with the EQXX, it was pretty cool also here in the CLA.""
The new CLA-Class will be a crucial model for Mercedes-Benz. Its first go at EVs, the EQ-branded sedans and SUVs, didn’t really make a splash in the marketplace as expected. Future Mercedes electric models are now said to look much more like their familiar gas-powered counterparts. And like other automakers, Mercedes is also pushing back its all-electric goals as sales prove uneven.
But it can’t give up on EVs entirely. Mercedes faces intense electric competition in, and now from, China. It has strict emissions and fuel economy standards to meet globally. And the company long known for innovation doesn’t want to cede that leadership to anyone. So the CLA-Class will be the first of several new more compact, ultra-efficient electric sedans, wagons and even large crossovers. And they’ll have hybrid versions featuring batteries paired with a new high-efficiency four-cylinder engine.
Any way you look at it, efficiency is the name of the game here. The EQXX set new records for that on multiple occasions. Much of the technology from EQXX will live on in the CLA in some form or another, but Stegmaier said there have been some improvements, too.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
""The CLA has a similar motor"" to the EQXX, he said, improvements over the powertrain seen in the EQE and EQS covering not only hardware design but softer stuff, like the types of lubricants used within. Stegmaier declined to elaborate on that but said that the fundamental concept of the battery and its electronics, that of ""the one box,"" continues on from the EQXX as well.
With this design, Mercedes engineers placed not only the battery cells and thermal management but much of the charging and controller infrastructure together into a single component. This will surely simplify manufacturing but also optimize space within the Mercedes Modular Architecture, or MMA, the platform that the CLA will roll upon.
Mercedes CLA MMA Platform
It also creates room for a frunk, which previous models like the EQE and EQS have lacked. ""It is a very compact motor out in the front,"" Stegmaier said. ""So the compact design makes it possible to have a really quite cool frunk."" Stegmaier wouldn't give me a specific volume, but by the sound of things, a few groceries or a backpack would be reasonable.
But there'll be other improvements, too, including an energy density from the 85 kWh nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) pack that, Stegmaier says, is 20% higher than the company's previous cells.
The drivetrain configuration is substantially different from the EQ cars, too. While the front motor arrangement is similar, a permanently excited motor with a disconnect, the rear of the CLA relies on a two-speed transmission.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
Stegmaier called this system: ""The heart of efficiency."" Two speeds enable the rear motor to operate efficiently at a greater range of speeds.
Knowing that EV transmissions are a controversial topic—especially whether the additional complexity is worthwhile—I asked whether there was any internal debate about going with this approach for the CLA. ""It's not an easy decision because, as you said, it's also complex and costly,"" he said. ""But we were very clear. We also want to bring that efficiency into the CLA, and there, the two-speed gearbox is absolutely necessary.""
The result is a car that, Stegmaier says, will cover a whopping 5.2 miles per kWh and deliver 93% efficiency. That should trump even the Lucid Air Pure as the most efficient EV around. This performance, he said, actually hampered his team's earlier testing in the Alps.
""There were many times my team was coming up to me and saying, 'We had a problem. We couldn't do any charging tests because we couldn't get the car empty,'"" he said.
Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Prototype
PR-friendly testing problems aside, part of that efficiency in steep terrain is thanks to significantly higher regen rates than previous Mercedes-Benz EVs. The CLA is able to generate up to 200 kW under braking, or almost three times what a Tesla Model 3 can do. Stegmaier declined to say how many Gs the car can sustain under deceleration but did say that the most aggressive of the three regen modes (D, D-, and D+) will be a proper one-pedal experience, with the car coming to a complete stop.
That captured momentum will, of course, help recharge the battery via the car's 800-volt system. When it comes to charging the old-fashioned way, a 320 kW DC charger will enable grabbing 186 miles of charge in just 10 minutes, part of what helped the team cover over 2,300 miles in 24 hours in yet another record-breaking run.
That charging will happen via a Tesla-style NACS plug, while a separate J1772 plug is there for slower duties. And, Stegmaier assured me that the power will flow both ways: ""We will offer bidirectional charging, so you can use the CLA also as storage,"" he said.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
That's a lot of good news for EV owners, but the changes extend beyond the hardware of the new platform. The CLA will display significant software revisions as well, starting with the MB.OS system running in the dashboard.
The software controlling those motors is also improved, something Stegmaier said would be a boon in low-grip conditions, such as the slippery, snowy test ride I got. Even in deep snow, the CLA's dual-motor all-wheel-drive system didn't skip a beat.
Again, much of this is thanks to the learnings from the electric EQXX, but many were surprised to learn that the platform it spawned, MMA, will also be used for a 48-volt hybrid.
Mercedes MMA Platform Hybrid Engine
Mercedes has confirmed they will release an internal combustion version of the CLA, and while that news dropped only recently, Stegmaier said a hybrid was always part of the plan: ""It was from the beginning,"" he said, ""because we want to offer both worlds, both customer needs. So if you go to the shop, you will buy a CLA. The second question will be, which powertrain do you want to choose?""
That, then, raises the question of how these two CLAs will be differentiated in the market. Both will simply be called CLA, with Mercedes-Benz relying on its numerical nomenclature to identify the powertrains, much like with the current G-Class. There, the internal combustion models are G550 or AMG G63, while the electric model is the G580.
Mercedes CLA-Class Specs
I asked Stegmaier if there would be any significant visual differentiators. ""There are little, very little, differences between the hybrid and the electric car,"" he said, suggesting the grille treatment will be the biggest differentiator.
That means you'll be able to see more than a little of the design heritage of the ultra-efficient EQXX EV even in the gas-powered CLA. But where that car featured a dramatic but somewhat impractical shape, with a long tail designed to help aerodynamics, the CLA's shape will be more pert, more practical.
And, if the CLA Concept is any indication, something far more attractive than Mercedes' current EV offerings.

Tesla Model 3 RWD Displays Impressive Efficiency In European Testing,https://insideevs.com/news/744461/tesla-model3-green-ncap-rating/,The green spinoff of Euro NCAP says it “is a reason for Tesla engineers to be proud of their achievement.”,2024-12-16 10:00:57,"Tesla makes some of the most efficient electric cars on the market, and the most frugal is the Model 3. The pre-facelift Model 3 performed exceedingly well when Green NCAP tested it in 2022. The revised Highland model further improves upon its predecessor and earns the maximum five-star rating.
Green NCAP is run by the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP), and it rates vehicles not for safety but for harmful pollutants emitted and energy efficiency. It puts vehicles through three sets of tests: clean air, efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.
The Tesla Model 3 RWD was given a maximum Clean Air Index of 10.0 and 9.8 for its Greenhouse Gas Index. The Efficiency Index comprises four laboratory tests and four real-world road tests; the Model 3 scored the maximum in all of them, stretching its electrons further than most EVs.
They confirmed the base Model 3 (which, for the European market, where these tests are conducted, is made in China) with the LFP battery has a usable capacity of 60 kilowatt-hours. That’s more than most other estimates, which usually suggest that it has a 60 kW gross capacity with around 57.5 kWh usable.
The highway efficiency test, which is done at the typical European speed limit of 80.7 mph (130 km/h), yielded an impressive 2.98 miles/kWh (20.8 kWh/100 km), allowing it to cover up to 201 miles (324 km) of “dynamic high speed highway driving,” which Green NCAP says is “a new record value.” In mixed driving conditions, it achieved 4.37 miles/kWh (14.2 kWh/100 km), giving it a theoretical maximum range of 295 miles (475 km).
Its lowest consumption figure was achieved in the short urban trip test, where the vehicle averaged 5 miles/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km), allowing it to cover 340 miles (547 km) on a full charge. The car was also praised for its thermal management in the cold weather test, which was able to bring the temperature inside the cabin (specifically around the front headrests) to 64.4°F (18°C) in just 3 minutes after starting from cold with an outside temperature of 19.4°F (-7°C).
The Model 3 RWD got a final score of 98%, which is exactly the same as the recently tested 2024 Hyundai Kona EV, more than the BYD Atto 3 (which also has impressive safety credentials) with 96%, and less than the 2024 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, whose rating was 99%. The latter is the greenest car tested this year by Green NCAP, followed by the electric Kona in second place and the Model 3 in third.

Did General Motors Limit Its Future By Walking Away From Cruise?,https://insideevs.com/news/744467/gm-cruise-cm-sales-december/,"Plus, the auto industry closes out 2024 with a nasty ""hangover"" after riding high during the pandemic.",2024-12-16 10:00:13,"There's a kind of big-picture way of looking at General Motors' decision to acquire, and less than a decade later, ultimately suspend, its Cruise robotaxi division: what are car companies supposed to be in the future?
Are automakers just going to make individual, privately owned cars in the coming years, decades and even centuries? Or are they going to be, and do, much more than that? Perhaps on a long enough timeline, the future of mobility really will be fully automated pods, or even flying vehicles; I tend to think that if either of those things actually happen, I'll have already been dead for a long time. But if so, who will make those vehicles, and who will usher us into that era? For now, GM has more immediate, short-term problems to deal with, but there are mixed opinions on its recent decision to walk away from the robotaxi business.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of transportation and tech news. Also on tap today: while we're concerned with the future, the auto industry's present isn't in very good shape either. Let's dig in.
GM Cruise Self-Driving Chevy Bolt Stuck In San Francisco (Source: Tesla Owners Silicon Valley/Twitter)
I'll admit we picked an interesting week to name GM CEO Mary Barra as the InsideEVs Person of the Year. I stand by that decision because pivoting an old-school automaker to where it ends the year selling so many electric vehicles is a remarkable achievement—especially as so many others struggle. (More on that in a bit.) Our award process had been in the works for months and wasn't contingent on one week's news cycle.
But Barra's decision to cease robotaxi operations at Cruise and transfer the teams and technology development to passenger cars is a divisive one.
On the one hand, GM sunk more than $10 billion into Cruise since acquiring the company in 2016 and had little to show for it. The robotaxi service largely hit pause on its operations last year amid multiple crashes and high-profile safety mishaps, and I'd argue its reputation never really recovered from that. (I'd also argue that, having been in many Cruise rides myself, the tech was simply not as good as Waymo's autonomous vehicles; more mistakes, less certainty and less overall confidence.) And GM just took a $5 billion hit to restructure its bleak China operations; it had to save money somehow. I'm not shocked this happened at all.
But the other argument is that between losses in China and throwing in the towel on robotaxis, GM is cutting off potential pathways to the future. Here's CNBC on that:
Part of the plan was for GM’s innovation division to identify trillions—yes, trillions—of dollars in new market opportunities such as electric commercial vehicles, auto insurance, military defense, autonomous vehicles and even, eventually, the potential for “flying cars,” also known as urban air mobility.
While GM has declined to disclose how much revenue such businesses have produced, Barra, with the ending of its Cruise robotaxi operations on Tuesday, made it clear that the automaker’s growth priorities have shifted amid a broader, industrywide retrench to preserve capital. Companies including GM are now focused on more “core” operations and adjacent business opportunities, including software, EVs and “personal autonomous vehicles.”
The driverless ride-hailing service was supposed to be the shining star of GM’s growth opportunities, with executives just a few years ago referring to it as an $8 trillion market opportunity that the automaker would lead. That included former executives touting $50 billion in revenue by the end of this decade, and Cruise being valued at more than $30 billion.
Instead, after spending more than $10 billion on Cruise since acquiring it in 2016, GM is ending the robotaxi business and folding Cruise’s operations and an undetermined number of its nearly 2,300 employees into the automaker.
Also, a decade ago, the focus of Wall Street investors and analysts was more around long-term prospects and the ""be more like Tesla"" ethos; these days, it's all about those short term gains. So this part is interesting:
To GM’s credit, Wall Street, which previously pushed for such growth businesses, applauded the decision to end Cruise’s robotaxi ambitions. Shares of the company were initially higher, before ending the week level with when the announcement was made.
GM, like other companies, has quickly shifted from trying to impress Wall Street with growth initiatives, including generating $280 billion in new businesses by 2030, to refocusing efforts on its core business to generate profits amid economic and recessionary concerns.
That's also especially interesting when you consider that Tesla—whose own EV sales have been steadily losing market share, including to GM—has most of its sky-high valuation tied up in the idea that it can one day ""solve"" fully driverless cars.
So, investors want GM to be a car and truck company, and Tesla to unlock the driverless-car future. Do I have that right?
If I do, that really flies in the face of the ""we want to be seen as a tech company"" vibe that so many automakers have pushed over the past decade. If you're not some driver of future technology, you're just a legacy business with low profit margins, high capital and labor costs, destined to duke out inches of market share with the likes of Volkswagen and Nissan forever. And no car company wanted that. But a lot of this just isn't going all that well for many of them, including GM:
GM’s plans to diversify its business through fashionable industries such as ridesharing and other “mobility” ventures — a trendy term used previously by the industry for growth initiatives — or startups have largely fallen flat since the automaker started investing in such growth areas in 2016.
The automaker earlier this year folded its BrightDrop EV commercial vans into Chevrolet amid lackluster sales. It’s also failed to announce any meaningful plans for fuel cells for tie-ups with boats, trains and airplanes, and it’s shuttered several prior “mobility” businesses.
I am glad that story points out the promising potential of GM Energy, because cool things are happening over there. And on this so-called ""personal autonomy"" front, Super Cruise is truly excellent right now, and about the only automated driving assistance system (ADAS) I've used that I really and genuinely trust.
But this whole industry is reckoning with the future, and balancing that with paying the bills in the short-term. I can only wish I knew how to crack that equation.
Between its EV sales, overall profits and bets on the future that are working, GM actually had a better year in 2024 than most. The same, I think, will be said of Hyundai Motor Group and a couple of others. Make no mistake, however: this was a very rough year for the auto industry. Maybe the gloomiest since the lead-up to the Great Recession.
These are issues that frequent Critical Materials flyers will know very well, but the New York Times has a good summary of why this current moment feels so dismal after the car industry saw a surge in sales during the pandemic:
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Emphasis mine, because that's the heart of the problem.
The car business expands and contracts all of the time. Sales skyrocketed a decade ago amid the recovery from the financial crisis, then naturally started slowing by the close of the 2010s; people don't need new cars all of the time. Then people bought like crazy during the pandemic. But that, and the concurrent supply chain issues and pandemic-related inflation, drove prices to their sky-high levels I'd argue they're still at now. Yes, prices have gone down since their peaks, but we're still around $50,000 for average new car prices. Even more so for EVs.
The car industry is really seeing long-term demand declines in Europe, where buyer growth just isn't coming back, and China, where the brands we know are getting crushed by local newcomers. (And China's own car market has its limits as well.)
There just aren't many winners as we close out 2024. Stellantis and Volkswagen? Bad. Nissan? Even worse. Toyota? Doing really well on hybrids—for now—but not so much in China. Ford? Taking some hits after its early innovations in the EV space and shrinking across the world. Even luxury brands are struggling thanks to these same problems. And incoming President Donald Trump promising to nuke the EV tax credits also threatens billions of dollars in planned investments.
It does feel like the car business is poised for contraction more than anything else now—and as that story notes, an ""If you can't beat 'em, join up with them"" approach to China's EV makers.
California is the nation's leader in EVs and a huge driver of cleaner cars everywhere. That's because the state has the power to set its own emissions rules and more than a dozen other states follow those standards too. So its potential plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 has real power.
The fossil fuel industry, some members of the auto industry and conservative politicians have wanted to erase that power for decades, and now the U.S. Supreme Court will have something to say about it too. From The Guardian:
The US Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a bid by fuel producers to challenge California’s standards for vehicle emissions and electric cars under a federal air-pollution law in a major case testing the Democrat-governed state’s power to fight greenhouse gases.
The justices took up an appeal by a Valero Energy subsidiary and fuel industry groups over a lower court’s rejection of their challenge to a decision by Joe Biden’s administration to allow California to set its own regulations.The dispute centers on an exception granted to California in 2022 by the US Environmental Protection Agency to national vehicle emission standards set by the agency under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law.
The high court will not be reviewing the waiver itself, but instead will look at a preliminary issue: whether fuel producers have legal standing to challenge the EPA waiver.
This case won't go to trial until next spring but it's something we'll be watching closely. The petroleum companies' argument is that, essentially, California's waiver exceeds federal power and is also hurting their business:
They said they met the legal test for getting into court. As a “matter of common sense”, lawyers for the companies wrote, automakers would produce fewer electric vehicles and more gas-powered cars if the waiver were set aside, directly affecting how much fuel would be sold.
The current fight has its roots in a 2019 decision by the Trump administration to rescind the state’s authority. Three years later, with Biden in office, the EPA restored the state’s authority.
Valero’s Diamond Alternative Energy and related groups challenged the reinstatement of California’s waiver, arguing that the decision exceeded the EPA’s power under the Clean Air Act and inflicted harm on their bottom line by lowering demand for liquid fuels.
Won't someone please think of the oil companies?
Cruise Origin reveal
I don't think some of that argument above against GM is entirely fair. It's still doing well on EV sales, battery development, home energy stuff and is getting closer than many rivals to EV profitability. Plus, Super Cruise is massively underrated as ADAS tech. But the loss of the Cruise—or at least the idea of it—does sting somewhat if you're thinking really long-term.
So what are car companies supposed to be and how should they be viewed by customers and Wall Street alike? Let us know who you think will deliver the future, and how, in the comments.

"The $0-A-Month Fiat 500e Lease Deal Is Real, But There’s A Catch",https://www.motor1.com/news/744351/2024-fiat-500e-free-lease/,"All you have to pay are the taxes and fees, which total $62 a month over the 27-month lease.",2024-12-25 01:25:15,"Electric vehicles aren’t selling as well as automakers had hoped. Interest seems to be waning, and the growth rate is slowing, forcing dealers to offer some impressive incentives to move the product. The Larry H. Miller Chrysler Dodge Ram Fiat dealership in Aurora, Colorado, is one such outfit, offering the 2024 Fiat 500e for $0 down and $0 a month for 27 months.
While the advertisement says $0 a month, the lease isn’t completely free. The fine print spells out the true cost. Lessees will still need to pay taxes and fees totaling $1,693—$1,297.68 in estimated taxes and a $350 disposition fee. That comes out to just $62.69 a month, with state and federal incentives and rebates covering the actual upfront costs of the lease that go to the dealer. The feds have $7,500 to offer, while Colorado adds another $5,000 to the pot to bring costs down.
In a sea of new EVs, the 500e is odd. It has a 42-kilowatt-hour battery offering up to 149 miles of range on a single charge, with its front-mounted single motor providing propulsion. It’s also not cheap if you decide to purchase outright, with a starting price of $34,095 (including the $1,595 destination charge) before any incentives. The hatchback's small size and limited range make it perfect for urban driving, but also limits its audience.
Fiat has been struggling to sell the EV since its launch, most recently having to pause production at its Mirafiori, Italy, factory where it builds the 500e. The pause started at the end of last month, and the automaker appears to have extended the shutdown another two weeks until January 20, according to a new Reuters report.
The lease deal ends December 31, and it’s only available to Colorado residents. Lessees will have the option to purchase the EV for $17,388 once the lease expires.

U.S. EV Registrations Were Up In October Despite Tesla Being In The Red,https://insideevs.com/news/744553/ev-registrations-usa-october-2024/,"GM, Hyundai, Honda and Rivian had at least one model on the list of best-selling EVs. Tesla had three.",2024-12-16 08:23:26,"To be clear, Tesla is still the biggest player in the electric car market in the United States. That said, its grip seems to be slowly slipping.
In October, electric vehicle registrations in the United States went up 5% compared to the same month last year, thanks in no part to Tesla, which recorded a decline and nearly took down the whole industry with it if it weren’t for the likes of Hyundai, Chevrolet, Honda, Ford, Cadillac, Rivian and others.
In total, Americans bought 101,304 EVs in October, according to S&P Global Mobility. Out of those customers, fewer and fewer are going for Tesla models. In seven out of the first ten months of the year, the Elon Musk-led company saw its volume decline, and October is no different, with a 1.8% drop year-on-year.
More Good News From The EV Front
Without Tesla in the mix, EV registrations would have gone up 11% compared to last year, but–again–the overall volume would have been just 56,203. That’s because the Model Y and Model 3 are the country’s best-selling EVs by a long shot. In October alone, the Model Y recorded 21,787 registrations, down from the 25,220 units last year. Meanwhile, the Model 3 had 17,419 registrations, slightly up from last year’s 16,237. The controversial Cybertruck was also up there in the top 10 best-selling EVs in October, with 4,041 units registered.
However, Hyundai and General Motors saw the biggest gains, percentage-wise, as you can see in the table below.
The Chevy Equinox EV, Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq and Honda Prologue had huge jumps in the registration numbers because they were either not on sale in October of last year or deliveries were just starting to ramp up.
Meanwhile, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 managed to stay in the top three and recorded a 26% spike in registrations. A the other end of the top 10 list is the Rivian R1S, which noted 2,456 registrations, a 17% drop year-on-year.
When it comes to car brands, Tesla is the undisputed leader, followed by Chevrolet, Ford, Hyundai and Honda. Interestingly, Fisker, which went bankrupt earlier this year, had 110 registrations, more than Volkswagen, which had just 92. As a reminder, the German automaker’s volume seller, the ID.4 crossover, is under a stop-sale order due to a door handle recall.",Iulian Dnistran
The Tesla Cybertruck Might Have An Inventory Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/744506/tesla-cybertruck-foundation-series-inventory/,Limited-edition Foundation Series models are piling up in inventory across the country.,2024-12-16 04:05:16,"The limited-edition Tesla Cybertruck Foundation Series is piling in the automaker’s inventory. The Foundation Series was available until October in the United States for those who pre-ordered it and was the first version to be sold here after deliveries of the angular electric pickup began in November of last year.
It’s also the most expensive trim of the Cybertruck, costing either $99,990 for the dual-motor all-wheel drive or $119,990 for the tri-motor Cyberbeast. Technically, the Foundation Series isn’t any different from the run-of-the-mill Cybertruck, but the extra $20,000 on top of the base price brought customers extras like lifetime cellular connectivity, unrestricted access to the automaker’s so-called Full Self-Driving driving assistance system, a Powershare mobile connector, $2,500 in credits that could be used in Tesla’s online shop and a bunch of accessories.
Now though, there are dozens of these $100,000+ trucks sitting in Tesla’s inventory. Using the EV manufacturer’s website, we found brand-new Cybertruck Foundation Series models in several states including New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Colorado, Florida and Minnesota. There's also a report claiming Tesla is de-badging Foundation Series models to try and sell them as regular Cybertrucks in Canada.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Earlier this month, we reported that Tesla told some of its Cybertruck line workers to stay home, which led to speculation that the carmaker was having some demand issues with its flagship model.
Having said that, the top-tier units that ended up in inventory might collect dust for a while, seeing how the non-Foundation Series models cost $79,990 and $99,990 respectively. Sure, you won’t get FSD, lifetime premium connectivity and the Powershare mobile connector, but you get to keep $20,000 in the bank account, and that’s a lot of money whichever way you look at it. Plus, FSD can be used with a subscription that’s cancelable at any time–it costs $8,000 to buy it outright.
Then, there’s the issue of what was promised and what was delivered. When the Cybertruck debuted as a prototype back in 2019, Tesla touted a range of over 500 miles on a full charge, a towing capacity of over 14,000 pounds and a price between $39,900 and $69,900. None of these have translated into reality when deliveries officially started last November. The towing maximum capacity of the finished product is 11,000 lbs, the maximum range is 325 miles and the price is between $79,990 and $99,990. Granted, there’s supposedly a third, cheaper version on the way, with a single electric motor, but that hasn’t happened yet.",Iulian Dnistran
Mercedes-AMG Shows Its Electric Performance SUV For The First Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/744219/mercedes-amg-performance-suv-prototype-testing/,"The speedy SUV will have over 1,000 horsepower.",2024-12-25 01:25:16,"Mercedes-AMG is building two standalone performance vehicles: A high-powered SUV and a four-door coupe. The duo will use the brand's new AMG.EA architecture, and for better or worse, they'll both be electric. Today, we get our first official glimpse of the SUV in action, undergoing cold-weather testing in Sweden. And it looks… interesting.
Previewed earlier this year in a silhouette sketch, this is the first time anyone has seen the Mercedes-AMG SUV prototype on the road. Under all that camouflage the SUV has a four-door coupe-like design with a sharp front end and sleek bodywork. It will be similar in size to the current GLS, but best of all, it won't look anything like the current crop of Mercedes EQ products.
Details on the powertrain are still scarce, but we expect this SUV to be plenty powerful, and hopefully, equally as efficient. Mercedes has confirmed that the SUV will use axial flux motors and a new high-performance battery pack offering a 40-percent boost in energy density. That will yield an output of over 1,000 horsepower.
The current Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV is currently the most powerful AMG EV in the lineup. It has a 90.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 617 horsepower and 701 pound-feet of torque, which sends it to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds. This new SUV should be significantly brawnier.
Mercedes-AMG also released images of the four-door coupe undergoing testing in the snow, which we saw earlier this year. The electric sedan will replace the current AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, and use the same disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors as the SUV with an ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight.""
Expect to see both models in the metal sometime early in 2025.

What Lucid's Chief Engineer Thinks Of 'China's Apple Car',https://insideevs.com/news/744400/xiaomi-su7-lucid-chief-engineer/,Auto executives are obsessed with the Xiaomi SU7. Lucid's head engineer liked it too.,2024-12-15 12:00:00,"How the tables have turned. Historically, Chinese cars were nothing to write home about and Chinese car companies relied heavily on know-how shared with them by Western, Japanese and Korean partners. Now, China is the world’s biggest exporter of cars and the rest of the world is scrambling to understand how its homegrown car companies manage to make EVs that are so cheap, so good and so quick to market.
Because Chinese juggernauts like BYD and Geely are already storming into Europe and South America, and there’s good reason to believe the U.S. is next.
The Xiaomi SU7.
Automakers from Ford to Rivian have bought and benchmarked Chinese EVs to uncover their secrets—a common practice across the auto industry.
Lucid Motors has also been testing and tearing apart Chinese cars to better understand and learn from the competition, the startup’s chief engineer, Eric Bach, told InsideEVs in a recent interview. They have a lot of strengths, so it would be silly to ignore that, he said—especially as the firm ramps up new offerings like the Gravity SUV and upcoming affordable models.
“They've got core strengths in the digital realm,"" Bach said. ""They've got enormous speed capabilities and incredible work ethic that gives them a lot of product. And they've got government subsidies, obviously, that have created a huge competitive drive in China. And they're about to try to figure out how they go global.""
“So if you're not aware of that, that would be living in oblivion and not right,"" he said.
The company has a Nio and a Zeekr, and has ordered a Xiaomi SU7, David Lickfold, who leads Lucid’s vehicle dynamics team, told us this month. Bach said each Chinese brand has its strengths and weaknesses.
Generally speaking, though, Chinese automakers are crushing it in two key respects. One that may be surprising to some is craftsmanship.
The Xiaomi SU7.
“If you look at the maturity and the refinement of the exterior body or the interiors, you can find some of the competitors there showing a very high standard of execution,” Bach said. “And I think it is really important to acknowledge that the Chinese competition is not bad in terms of quality.”
The Nio EC6.
One model that exemplifies that is the SU7, he said. Consumer-technology company Xiaomi’s first-ever vehicle has proven extremely popular in China and has come to symbolize, in a sense, what China is capable of. The four-door Porsche Taycan lookalike—sometimes called “China’s Apple car”—recently got heaps of praise from Ford CEO Jim Farley.
China is also excelling in terms of digital features and infotainment software, Bach said, adding that Lucid is working to go that direction with the Gravity, its SUV that just started production. That vehicle has a sprawling curved display and a brand-new infotainment system that addresses some of the clunkiness of Lucid’s previous software.
The interior of a Ji Yue car.
“What [Chinese firms] have, maybe a little bit more, is more people that are programming at more hours per week, seemingly, and therefore the output is really, really high,” he said. “And we need to measure ourselves there and strive to be as quick and as imaginative.”
Ji Yue, a joint effort from the Chinese auto group Geely and tech firm Baidu that makes vehicles it calls ""robocars,"" impressed him with its digital experience, and in particular its navigation, voice command and advanced driver-assistance systems. (That firm has since run into trouble of its own, proving yet again that while Chinese automakers are impressive, they're not invincible—or above the same problems that can affect many EV newcomers.)
Where Chinese firms tend to come up short is in driving dynamics and performance, Bach said.
“I think the whole package comes together only at Lucid, and we were going to work really hard to keep it that way,” Bach said.
He has to. Because while the Chinese automakers are kept at bay in the U.S. by tariffs and regulations for now, that may not be the case forever—and Lucid could face its most intense, direct competition at a time when it's still trying to ramp up mass-production of its most important EVs.

California’s 2035 Gas Car Ban May Be Finalized Next Week: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/744407/ev-california-gas-car-sales-ban-2035/,The Biden administration may land a huge win for EVs next week as it's reportedly finalizing California's 2035 gas car sales ban.,2024-12-15 10:00:34,"California is the first state planning to phase out the sales of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, but that decision isn't federally approved yet. Now President Biden is racing to safeguard his climate legacy before leaving office next month, pushing forward multiple climate-focused agendas in the final days of his tenure. That includes greenlighting California's ambitious 2035 gas car ban as soon as next week, two people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post.
The transportation sector accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and passenger cars account for more than half of transportation emissions. Apart from planet-warming carbon dioxide, gas and diesel cars also emit hazardous byproducts like nitrous dioxide, carbon monoxide and soot that are directly linked to lung diseases, aggravated asthma and respiratory illnesses. The public health risks from gas car emissions have been widely researched and reported.
President-elect Donald Trump will likely attempt to revoke California's gas car ban, but he could run into legal obstacles. California used to have the most polluted air in the country historically, but things changed dramatically after the Clean Air Act of the 1970s that allowed the EPA to grant the state a waiver to set its own emissions standards to curb pollution. Now California is the biggest market in America for EVs and its efforts to move away from gas cars are recognized worldwide.
The Environmental Protection Agency already allows California to set stricter climate and emissions rules than the rest of the U.S. The zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have been adopted by 17 other states including Washington, Colorado and New York. Some of those states have also shown the intent to end gas cars sales next decade. (On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging California's authority to set its own emissions standards.)
The Biden administration is making a flurry of last-minute moves to lock in its climate plans before Trump takes over and threatens to reverse years of progress. Rivian just scored a massive $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to build its Georgia plant for next-gen models. The DOE approved a $1.5 billion loan for EVgo to roll out 7,500 new chargers across the country. And days after the presidential election, battery recycler Li-Cycle landed a $445 million loan to build a plant in Rochester, New York.

Could Plug & Charge Protocol Make EV Charging As Easy As One Two Three?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743799/plug-charge-protocol-ev-charging-easier-usa/,This could mean the end of pesky apps and tedious payment authentication systems.,2024-12-25 01:25:17,"EVs of both the four- and two-wheeled variety are gaining popularity all over the world. No matter where you go, it seems that more and more EVs are parked in malls, commercial centers, and office buildings. And indeed, the allure of sustainability, convenience, and practicality is what fools so many into spending way too much money on these appliances on wheels.Surely, when buying an EV, you’d think that charging should be much easier than filling up at the pumps. And while in theory it should be as easy as charging your smartphone, this couldn’t be any further from the truth.You see, there are layers upon layers of faff that can quickly turn your dream charging experience into a nightmare. You know, apps, subscriptions, payment links, and authorization steps? I ran into this craziness not too long ago when I drove for a buddy of mine in his EV. We decided to charge it up at a gas station while grabbing some lunch. How hard could it be? All I had to do was plug the damn thing in, right? Spoiler alert: I was wrong.
The charging station at our local Shell station made use of a third-party mobile app.
After plugging the thing into the charger, the screen told me that I had to download some obscure charging app I’d never heard of before. After that, I would then need to link said app to one of my P2P payment accounts, authorize it through email, and wait for an SMS verification code. By the time I found the App on the Apple App Store, our lunch was waiting for us. Not wanting my food to go cold, I decided that we had enough charge left to make it home, and decided not to deal with the hassle of using public charging infrastructure.
And I know that a lot of you share the same sentiments, too. Thankfully, however, the powers that be are taking notice, and things just might become a lot easier moving forward.
This is where the “Plug and Charge” protocol enters the picture. It’s a partnership between SAE Industry Technology Consortia, several manufacturers, and EV charging operators, and is backed by the Biden administration’s Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. A story by The Verge goes into great detail on how it all works, but in essence, the project’s goal is to make EV charging as easy as it should’ve been from the very start.
EV charging apps that require you to subscribe and link your payment information are a common pain point for EV owners.
With Plug and Charge, you can simply plug your EV into any public charger, and your vehicle will automatically communicate with the charger and bypass all the stuff you previously had to deal with. No more apps, no more logins, no more QR codes. Just charge, pay with your card, and ride away.
But of course, all this is much easier said than done. In order for Plug and Charge to be widely adopted, the collaboration of pretty much all automakers and electric motorcycle manufacturers is a must-have. And that’s because each and every Plug and Charge-equipped vehicle will need to have that line of code to communicate with chargers. So yeah, it isn’t magic, but rather, more tech to get around the hurdles brought to the table by, well, tech.
The article by The Verge reports that the project has cost around $1.5 million in development so far. But of course, should this thing be widely adopted, we can see the cost of this project growing substantially. Future funding will reportedly come from the companies that want to get involved. And at the end of the day, there’s a good chance that we as consumers will ultimately pay for the stuff. Manufacturers will market Plug and Charge as a feature of their vehicles, and this will likely reflect on the sticker price.
But hey, if they’re gonna milk us of our money, might as well do it in a way that’s as hassle-free as it can get, right?

The New DS N°8 Is France’s Most Luxurious EV,https://insideevs.com/news/744378/ds-no8-flagship-french-ev/,"There’s even a whiff of Cadillac about its design, which makes this something like a European Lyriq.",2024-12-14 14:00:39,"Posh Stellantis brand DS wants to be noticed with its new N°8, which sounds more like a new fragrance, not an electric coupe crossover. DS is a luxury spinoff of the Citroen brand, and the N°8 is its flagship product, which makes it France’s fanciest new car.
DS calls the N°8 its flagship even though it’s about 4.7 inches (12 centimeters) shorter in overall length compared to the DS9 sedan. Its maker says it’s an SUV, but it’s almost too low to even call it a crossover, with a total height of just over 62 inches (1.58 meters), which is almost the same as a Polestar 4.
However, even though it’s slightly smaller than the DS9, the N°8, which arrives in Europe around the middle of 2025, will be more expensive. Its starting price is just under €60,000 and a fully-loaded Etoile top trim with all the options will reach €85,000. Its direct rival, the Polestar 4, starts at €63,200, while a Volkswagen ID.7 costs around €54,000.
The base N°8 has a 74-kilowatt-hour battery good for 355 miles (572 kilometers) WLTP. The larger 97.2-kWh battery is rated for 466 miles (750 km) in the single-motor, front-wheel-drive configuration or 426 miles (686 km) in the dual-motor. Both batteries can charge at up to 200 kW, which is enough for a 20 to 80% charge in 27 minutes.
With a drag coefficient of just 0.24, the N°8 achieves a WLTP efficiency of 4.81 miles/kWh (12.9 kWh/100 km), which DS says is class-leading. One charge of the big battery should be able to power the car at 74.5 mph (120 km/h) for 310 miles (500 km) of constant highway driving.
Built on the STLA Medium 400-volt platform, the N°8 could have been equipped with mild and plug-in hybrid powertrains like the mechanically related Peugeot 3008 and 5008. However, only pure electric variants are offered. The base car features a single 227-horsepower electric motor that is dialed up to 242 hp with the long-range battery.
The most potent variant has a 345 hp dual-motor powertrain that temporarily goes up to 370 hp when the boost function is activated. This allows the N°8 to accelerate to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 5.4 seconds and up to 118 mph (190 km/h) flat out.
Technically, the DS N°8 has very similar numbers to the related Peugeot models, but it’s through its design that it stands out. Its light clusters are sharp, and they define the edges of its fascias, which is something Cadillac has also been doing with its design language for quite a while. Its greenhouse is low, and the fastback rear end is very aggressive, giving it quite a sporty look even by coupe crossover standards.
Inside, DS went for a bold steering wheel design that makes the driving experience feel very futuristic. It gets a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display complemented by a very wide 16-inch infotainment screen, and everything around them looks very extravagant—it’s quite an artsy-looking interior, and with available Alcantara or Nappa leather upholsteries and gold trim, it doesn’t look like anything else.
Since it’s French, you can expect some quirks, one of which being the interior door pulls that you find by reaching behind the speaker grilles. The faux grille in the front is also illuminated on the top variant, which makes an already bold design even more noticeable. Space in the trunk is abundant too, with an impressive maximum load volume of 21.9 cubic feet (620 liters) and easy access thanks to a powered hatch.
Other models it shares its platform with include the Opel Grandland and the Citroen C5 Aircross, both of which are also available with combustion powertrains. Stellantis is also working on a new Lancia Gamma built on the same underpinnings, which, like the DS N°8, will only come with electric power when it arrives in 2026.

The Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Way More Expensive Than The Gas Version,https://www.motor1.com/news/744052/escalade-iq-price/,"The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ starts at $129,900 including destination. That's over $40,000 than the cheapest gas-powered Escalade.",2024-12-25 01:25:18,"Cadillac has released pricing for the Escalade IQ, the all-electric version of its extremely popular luxury people-mover. The 2025 Escalade IQ will start at $129,900 with the $2,290 destination fee included, which is over $40,000 more than the cheapest gas-powered model.
Despite the similar names, the electric IQ and the gas-powered Escalade are fairly different SUVs. While the standard Escalade shares its squared-off bones and V-8 engine with its GM counterparts from Chevy and GMC, the IQ uses the platform found on trucks like the Hummer EV and Silverado EV. It's a foot longer than the gas Escalade and comes with its own body design that's far more sculpted and swept back, to improve aerodynamics.
The Escalade IQ will launch in four trims: Luxury 1, Sport 1, Luxury 2, and Sport 2. No matter which you choose, you'll get a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain powered by an Ultium battery pack with over 200.0 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity. Cadillac says this setup is good for 750 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque, with an estimated range of 460 miles. Pricing with destination for each trim can be seen below.
Aside from styling details like exterior trim and door handles, Luxury 1 and Sport 1 are essentially the same, equipment-wise. Both get standard features like a panoramic glass roof, 24-inch wheels, LED lighting, and rain-sensing wipers. Inside you'll find acres of synthetic leather, heated and ventilated seats, five-zone climate control, and a massive 55.0-inch display for the gauge cluster and infotainment screen.
Step up to Luxury 2 or Sport 2, and you get a 36-speaker sound system by AKG, massaging front seats, and different LED lighting. Importantly, going for either of the two higher trims adds a trailering package as standard, which comes with things like better blind-spot detection, a trailer brake controller, and a suite of apps and camera views to make the trailering experience easier. Opting for Sport or Luxury 2 also allows you to add the Executive Second Row Seating Package, which installs 14-way adjustable seats to the second row, as well as a center console with flip-out tables.
The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is expected to arrive at dealerships by the end of the year.

The Lucid Gravity Is Here. Now Comes The Hard Part.,https://insideevs.com/news/744393/lucid-gravity-production-eric-bach/,We talked to Lucid chief engineer Eric Bach about the start of Gravity production and what comes next.,2024-12-14 12:00:00,"Sleek, futuristic Lucid Gravity SUVs started trickling off the production line at the startup automaker's Arizona factory last week after years of development and some delays. Lucid Motors hopes its second-ever model will ignite sales like never before and pave the way for long-term financial health. But it has a hill to climb before any of that can happen.
Soon, Lucid will have to start churning out more vehicles more quickly than it’s ever had to before. That ramp-up process has proven fraught for new automakers, like Tesla. And that’s only half the battle. There’s not even a guarantee that buyers will line up in droves, given Lucid’s prior challenges with brand awareness.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
The launch of the Gravity is a make-or-break moment for Lucid, which has yet to turn a profit and has relied on billions in infusions from its majority shareholder, the Saudi Public Investment Fund. It’s the SUV that will drive revenue until Lucid’s true mainstream EV hits the road later this decade. The arrival of “Project Midsize,” a roughly $50,000 crossover, will mark Lucid’s Tesla Model Y moment—when it can hopefully hit the scale needed to reliably earn more than it spends.
Until then, the Gravity needs to be a hit. And that starts with ramping up production from a few units to thousands and then tens of thousands—no small feat.
“The key is to bring all the elements and areas together at the same time, at the right quality,” Eric Bach, Lucid’s chief engineer, told InsideEVs in a recent interview. “And that is what a ramp is about.”
Here are those elements, according to Bach. First off, you need a product that’s mature and durable and won’t result in endless warranty repairs once it starts going out to customers. You also need a supply base that’s dialed in and can ramp up production alongside the main assembly plant.
Lucid Gravity and Lucid Chief Engineer Eric Bach
The third leg of the stool is a competent factory and logistics system. Bach says ramping up production is stressful for any car company, but he believes Lucid is ready for it.
“The second ramp is always better than and easier than the first ramp because we've built more capabilities. I'm not afraid of the ramp at all,” he said. “Surely, there will be some hiccups and pain, but that's normal.”
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Lucid ran up against all manner of supply-chain and manufacturing issues when it started producing the Air sedan, its first and so far only model, at scale in 2022. But it’s far from alone there.
Famously, Tesla nearly went bankrupt during early Model 3 production in 2017 and 2018, a period Tesla CEO Elon Musk called ""production hell."" Even well-oiled automakers that have been doing this for a century have hit snags in manufacturing new electric models. General Motors spent months solving battery-production bottlenecks as it launched its new EVs like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq last year.
Lucid is focused on ramping up the Gravity with high quality, Bach said, echoing Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson’s comments on a recent earnings call. Although production has begun, Lucid hasn’t said when customer deliveries will start.
“I anticipate that we're going to be manufacturing-constrained next year in the buildup of Gravity,” he said in early November. “We need to get the quality right and take a judicious and very prudent approach to meeting customer expectations with the quality as we ramp up.”
As production gets underway, Bach’s team is hammering away on future over-the-air updates for the Gravity. And it’s working on homologating the SUV for global markets. It’s also been conducting testing with Tesla Superchargers, seeing as the Gravity will ship from the factory with Tesla’s previously exclusive charging port design. (It’s one of the first such models since the entire auto industry announced it would migrate to Tesla’s plug.)
Lucid hasn’t officially announced access to Tesla’s charging network for its owners, but Bach says that will happen in advance of the first Gravity deliveries.
The other big challenge facing Lucid here, and Rawlinson referred to it on that same earnings call, concerns demand and brand awareness. The startup sold just 6,001 Air sedans in 2023, and it’s projecting production of 9,000 vehicles this year. That’s a far cry from where it had expected to be by this point.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
In 2021, Lucid predicted that it would make 90,000 vehicles in 2024, including 41,000 Airs and 49,000 Gravity SUVs. That was based on the Gravity starting production in 2023, which it didn’t. So that delay accounts for about half the shortfall. On top of that, lots of people simply don’t know what a Lucid is or that they should even consider buying one.
“I’ve stated before that we’re not manufacturing-constrained,” Rawlinson said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “We’ve been market-constrained.”
Rawlinson said that Lucid’s brand awareness has been improving and that the Gravity should benefit from that momentum. Plus, the brand is planning an advertising blitz and more brick-and-mortar locations as part of the Gravity’s launch.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Bach is convinced that the Gravity itself will do wonders for the Lucid brand.
Sedans like the Air don't sell in large numbers anymore, which has held Lucid back. It’s a shame, in a way, because the Air is one of the best—if not the best—electric vehicles you can buy in America today. The Gravity, a seven-seat SUV, should unlock six times the addressable market of the Air and get Lucid on a lot more radars, Bach said. Then word-of-mouth can take over.
“I'm very positive that a better product is always the key starting point” for building a brand, he said.
On paper, the Gravity is indeed a mind-blowing vehicle. The Grand Touring model, the first to launch, will offer a whopping 450 miles of EPA-rated range, over 800 horsepower and over 900 pound-feet of torque. It’s pretty extraordinary in person as well, as I learned during a test drive in Malibu, California this month.
The thing looks like nothing else on the road, drives better than any hulking SUV should, offers a dazzling digital interface and has as much room inside as your average New York City apartment.
A teaser of Lucid's upcoming midsize crossover.
It has the potential to be a slam dunk. But it’s yet to be seen whether people will embrace that oddball, minivan-like shape. And then there’s the price; the Gravity Grand Touring starts at $94,900, more than tried-and-true gas-powered rivals like the BMW X7 or Volvo XC90. A $79,900 Touring model should arrive sometime next year.
There’s a lot riding on the Gravity. But Lucid is also steaming toward its next project, a smaller, more affordable family of vehicles expected to start production in 2026. About half of Bach’s team is working on that, he said.
“It never stops in my role,” Bach said.

"Tesla Cybertruck After 50,000 Miles: Owner Details Issues, Charging Costs",https://insideevs.com/news/744191/tesla-cybertruck-50000-miles-issues-costs/,"This is the highest-mileage Cybertruck in the world, supposedly.",2024-12-14 10:00:17,"The Tesla Cybertruck. It’s controversial because of its looks, higher-than-originally-advertised price, several recalls and unfortunate mishaps experienced by some owners. However, not all Cybertruck owners have had issues with their angular electric pickups.
Take, for instance, the truck detailed in the Teslatino video embedded below. With a little over 50,000 miles added on the clock since March, it’s supposedly the highest-mileage Cybertruck in the world, so it’s the perfect candidate for seeing what could go wrong with the controversial EV.
This particular Cybertruck had its fair share of travel, including a pretty epic trip to the Arctic Ocean earlier this year, so what could have gone wrong surely already went wrong. Well, sort of.
More Cybertruck Stories
Let’s start with the range estimate. This is an All-Wheel Drive Cybertruck which had an original range estimate of 318 miles on a full charge. Now, after 50,000 miles, the estimate never goes above 309 miles with a full battery, but bear in mind that the pickup has a roof rack and a roof tent, as well as off-road-oriented tires, all of which would affect the driving range in any EV. In other words, the range loss has been minimal given the circumstances.
In the energy efficiency department, the numbers look like this: an average efficiency of 513 Wh/mile or 1.95 miles/kWh. That’s not great but not terrible for a big truck with a roof rack and roof tent. Before these accessories were installed, the efficiency was a bit better at 471 Wh/mile or 2.12 miles/kWh.
So, how much did it cost to charge the Cybertruck for all this time? It depends. In total, the electric truck used 25,628 kWh of energy. Charging at home, where the owner’s electricity price is $0.11/kWh, comes to $2,819. If Tesla Superchargers are the only option, the total charging costs rise to $7,688, considering a price of $0.30/kWh. The owner said he predominantly used Superchargers from the very start, so the charging costs are pretty high, but the potential for lower costs exists in the form of home charging. By comparison, a gas-powered Ford F-150 would have needed roughly $7,000 in fuel, so take it as you may.
The only real issue with the truck was the motorized tonneau cover, which was misaligned a couple of times and some service visits were required. The recall for the accelerator pedal was also performed–the pedal cover was riveted at the bottom to prevent it from sliding out and blocking the accelerator in its wide-open position.
Here’s where things get a little more interesting, though. The rear motor of this all-wheel drive Cybertruck was swapped for a new unit–not because it was broken but because Tesla wanted to evaluate the potential damage inside it. That’s because this is allegedly the highest-mileage Cybertruck out there, so the automaker wanted to get some real-world information about the hardware.
Steer-by-wire also got a big thumbs-up from the owner. As a reminder, there’s no steering column on the Cybertruck–instead, the steering wheel sends digital signals to the steering motor.
That’s pretty much it. Granted, that rear motor swap is rather suspicious and a regular, non-influencer-type owner likely wouldn’t get the same treatment, but there was nothing wrong with the original unit to begin with. But what’s your take on this? Let us know in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran
The VW ID. Buzz Beats Its EPA Range Rating In The Real World,https://insideevs.com/news/744372/vw-id-buzz-real-world-range/,A new range test from Edmunds proves the ID. Buzz isn't as range-limited as we thought.,2024-12-13 15:00:22,"I wasn't too impressed by the Volkswagen ID. Buzz. I loved the design, but I couldn't quite figure out who it was for. Every minivan owner I know does a lot of road trips, and with a 231-mile EPA rating in mixed city/highway driving, the all-wheel-drive version didn't look up to the task. The rear-wheel-drive version was barely better, with 234 miles of range. But based on new testing from Edmunds, VW may be understating things.
Edmunds runs an efficiency loop that tries to re-create the EPA driving cycle. Part of why many cars ""underperform"" their stated ranges when tested solely on the highway is because the EPA range figure isn't a highway number. It's based on a mix of 55% city driving, 45% highway driving. But unlike gasoline cars, EVs are far more efficient in the city than they are in the highway.
EVs don't waste fuel idling, don't mind working from a stop and don't lose nearly as much energy braking, as they have regenerative braking systems that recapture their kinetic energy. But since electric motors are so efficient and have so few other efficiency losses, air resistance has a greater affect on range. Since resistance increases exponentially with speed, highway driving at 70 mph is a worst-case scenario for an EV, which would rather putter around town at 25 mph.
Automakers don't like it when customers feel short-changed by real-world range that doesn't live up to the advertised number. Many, therefore, try to make sure their numbers remain realistic on the highway, or when it's cold. The Germans are famous for this, which is why the Porsche Taycan always over-performs on our highway range tests. Now, we have our first bit of evidence that the ID. Buzz could be similar.
The all-wheel-drive version did 263 miles on Edmunds' test loop, beating its 231-mile range estimate by 32 miles. That's a good sign, though frankly I'm not sure it changes my contention that the ID. Buzz will be a poor fit for road trips. First, I expect that number to be considerably lower for a highway-only trip. Highway time is particularly punishing to big, blocky EVs like the Buzz, and so I'm doubtful that the Buzz can considerably beat its 231-mile range on the highway. It's also worth noting that this test was done unladen in Southern California, and therefore represents a best-case scenario.
Finally, you're not going to run your EV to 0%, and you're not likely to charge much beyond 80%. Which means your real world range between 26-minute stops—after an initial long stint, assuming you start with a full battery—will be between 161 and 185 miles, depending on if you go off the EPA or the Edmunds figure. That assumes warm weather and no significant payload. For $70,000 or more, I think the average minivan buyer is going to expect more.
That's ok. This isn't a product designed to replace the minivan. It's a cool halo product that'll sell on its design. For those willing to accept its range and price, there's at least good news. At least in mixed driving, the ID. Buzz can beat its range figure. To find out how it does on the highway, you'll have to wait for our 70-mph range test.

Chevrolet Bolt EV And EUV: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/744245/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-used-buying-guide/,"Nearly every used Chevrolet Bolt EV should meet the $25,000 threshold to be eligible for the used EV tax credit.",2024-12-13 13:00:01,"The Chevrolet Bolt EV’s superpower was value. Few would call the Bolt EV brilliant, sexy or premium-feeling. It was a solid EV, delivering a respectable 259 miles of EPA range starting for less than $30,000. Sales figures were perking up. But then GM pulled the plug on the model to make room for next-gen Ultium-powered EVs.
While you can no longer buy a new Chevrolet Bolt EV, there are plenty of used examples on the market with leases expiring and fleet sales. The Bolt EV was inexpensive to begin with. Used EV prices are tumbling. Scoring a used Bolt EV can get you a serviceable EV for a shockingly great deal.
Are you thinking of buying a used Chevrolet Bolt EV? Here are the key factors you need to consider.
Used Bolt EVs are affordable by EV or any other standard. Pre-refresh 2017-21 model Bolt EVs cost between $10,000 and $15,000. Post-refresh 2022-23 model year Bolt EVs cost between $15,000 and $20,000. Nearly every used Chevrolet Bolt EV should meet the $25,000 threshold to be eligible for the used EV tax credit.
Chevy Bolt Range Tests
The Bolt EV lineup remained relatively static. However, Chevy did make some significant changes during the model run. The Bolt EV upgraded from a 60 kWh to a larger 66 kWh battery pack for the 2020 model year, adding 21 miles in EPA range (from 238 to 259 miles). Chevy refreshed the Bolt EV for 2022, making aesthetic changes inside and out and adding a faster 48 amp Level 2 charging capability.
Chevy also added the Bolt EUV during the 2022 refresh. It shared the same electric powertrain and platform as the Bolt EV. The main difference was the Bolt EUV being 6.3 inches longer, permitting an extra 3.1 cubic feet of cabin space. Though, paradoxically, the larger Bolt EUV had less cargo space, 16.0 cubic feet vs. 16.6 cubic feet. The Bolt EUV also had GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving on its Premier trim.
More Bolt Recall Info
No one wants an EV that will catch on fire. And the Chevrolet Bolt EV suffered perhaps the most infamous fire-related recalls in the industry. GM recalled more than 140,000 Bolt EVs due to the risk of batteries spontaneously igniting. Ominous warnings instructed owners to park the vehicles outside and more than 50 feet from other vehicles.
The main concern for used Bolt EV buyers is how the recall was addressed. Many Bolt EVs, particularly those built between 2017 and 2019, had their battery packs replaced with new (and larger 66 kW) battery packs. Other Bolt EVs have received monitoring software instead of a complete battery replacement. GM also bought back many Bolt EVs from owners, now hitting the market again.
Prospective buyers should consult the vehicle’s maintenance record and CARFAX report to determine whether and how the Bolt EV’s battery recall was addressed.
One concern with Bolt EVs is their fast charging capability (or lack of it by modern standards). The Bolt EV packs older GM battery tech. It tops out at 55 kW and tapers down as the battery fills. At that rate, it can take the Bolt EV around 75 minutes to perform a full 10-80% charge — too long to make road trips or living without a home charger convenient.
The Bolt EV also lacks a heat pump found on more modern EVs. A heat pump reduces the energy required to heat the cabin to mitigate range loss in cold weather. Not having the heat pump leaves the Bolt EV susceptible to more than 30 percent range loss in cold weather.
Owners have not reported many consistent mechanical issues with Bolt EVs beyond the battery pack. However, buyers should ensure that all software updates and recalls have been addressed to avoid technical glitches.
Bolts With Bonus Range
All EVs suffer some battery degradation. Chevrolet warns of a potential 10-40% capacity drop for Bolt EVs during the 100,000-mile warranty period. Though anecdotally, Bolt EV owners have reported far less than that. YouTubers have noted degradation of around 5% at 100,000 miles and a little over 8% at 150,000 miles. And many of the oldest Bolt EVs on the road have effectively restarted the degradation clock with brand-new batteries.
Used Bolt EV buyers can do their due diligence by assassin the vehicle battery’s health before buying. Many dealers will already have performed tests through a service like Recurrent.
Typically, yes. Chevrolet provided a three-year or 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty on the Bolt EV. Bolt EVs came with an additional eight-year or 100,000-mile battery and powertrain warranty. Bolt EVs that have had their battery replaced as part of the recall received a new eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty.",Ty Duffy
Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,2024-12-25 01:25:21,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

How Nissan Blew It,https://insideevs.com/news/744333/nissan-hybrid-tesla-mercedes-cm/,"Nissan's U.S. strategy may be permanently behind the curve. Plus, the Trump Administration may end autonomous car crash reports like Tesla wants.",2024-12-13 11:30:00,"A decade ago, there were basically two names in the electric vehicle game: Tesla and Nissan.
Sure, several other car companies were dabbling in hybrids too, some of which would backtrack in later years. But it looked like a Silicon Valley upstart and a Japanese pioneer would be leading the way to a future that depended less on gasoline and more on electricity. Now, as Nissan enters 2025, its future feels less certain than ever. How did it go from leader in the EV and hybrid space to being so behind technologically that it's no longer offering the cars American buyers even want?
That kicks off this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and auto industry news. Make sure to also tune in to today's episode of the Plugged-In Podcast from InsideEVs as well. Also on deck today: Tesla wants the new White House to get rid of a crucial autonomous car safety metric, and Mercedes-Benz gives its vans an electric reset. Let's dig in.
Nissan E-Power Cutaway
The future is electric. Or at least, electrified. Sales of purely internal combustion vehicles have been in freefall globally since 2017, EV sales are the fastest-growing new car segment, and even if American buyers aren't ready to give up gasoline completely they are flocking to hybrids in droves. And here in the U.S., an automaker that was once a leader in both has nothing to offer those buyers.
Automotive News' Hans Griemel in Japan, one of the best reporters doing it, has a deep dive into Nissan's biggest crisis since its last one. Sales are way down, cash flow is ""dwindling,"" the stock price is tanking, the bond rating is almost junk and nothing looks to relieve pressure next year. According to that story, the appointment of a U.S. executive as the global Chief Financial Officer was not received well internally, due to the company's troubles in its most important market.
And then there's the electrified powertrain issue. Why not deploy the system used in cars like the E-Power Note, which sells well in other markets? Well:
All of it is far later than Nissan had indicated when it declared that hybrid technology would spread to America in high-end vehicles and that e-Power would form the backbone of electrification for a reborn Infiniti premium brand. The company even developed a more powerful system for overseas, including a version that bolts a high-tech turbocharged engine onto the series hybrid.
To hear headquarters tell it, North American executives dropped the ball.
“The U.S. team was not completely convinced that the electrification system was good for their business,” said one former executive involved with the decision-making. “They said U.S. consumers are not ready. It was a conservative approach.”
American product planners begged to differ. The setup didn’t provide enough charge for high-speed, long-distance highways, they said. Moreover, U.S. drivers were vexed by the decoupled feeling between the all-electric acceleration and the on-again, off-again engine generator.
Meanwhile, house-proud engineers in Japan resisted using a better-fit strong hybrid solution, such as the E-Tech setup developed by partner Renault that it could have borrowed.
So the answer instead was to do nothing, and now the Nissan Murano's big technical achievement is that it's getting rid of the V6 for a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Much like just about every other car company was doing a decade ago. It's not great.
Now, the question becomes this: could a thriving Chinese automaker acquire Nissan and use that as a sideways entry point into the U.S.? Possibly.
Nissan’s U.S. assembly plants and expansive dealer network make it a valuable prize for any Chinese automaker wanting instant access to the world’s most coveted market. The company’s manufacturing know-how is another handy asset.
“A Chinese OEM could be very interested in Nissan,” said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at the Itochu Research Institute’s Center for Industry Research. EV makers such as Nio, Xpeng or BYD could see Nissan as a good partner, as might Taiwan’s Foxconn, the iPhone maker trying to break into the auto business, Fukao said.
Griemel's story is worth a read in full. He reports that a plug-in hybrid Rogue is supposedly coming to the U.S. in late 2025 as well as an extended-range variant. But even those future offerings are years behind schedule.
It's important to note that the lack of electrification isn't the sole reason Nissan is in trouble here. But it's leading to a bigger problem of an uncompelling lineup of cars with a lacking strategy for how to urgently fix it.
Tesla Autopilot Crash
Tesla is betting the farm on fully autonomous cars and robotaxis. But its autonomous efforts so far have had more issues than just about any other company out there. When you look at the incidents involving Autopilot and Full Self-Driving over the years, it makes General Motors' Cruise (RIP) look like the very model of safety.
Now that CEO Elon Musk has a considerable amount of sway with the incoming Trump administration, the government may ""cripple the ability to [...] investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles with automated-driving systems."" Here's a scoop from Reuters:
Musk, the world's richest person, spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. Removing the crash-disclosure provision would particularly benefit Tesla, which has reported most of the crashes – more than 1,500 – to federal safety regulators under the program. Tesla has been targeted in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigations, including three stemming from the data.
The recommendation to kill the crash-reporting rule came from a transition team tasked with producing a 100-day strategy for automotive policy. The group called the measure a mandate for ""excessive"" data collection, the document seen by Reuters shows.
[...] In recent years, Tesla executives discussed with Musk the need to push for scrapping the crash-reporting requirement, according to one of the sources.
But because Biden officials expressed enthusiasm for the program, Tesla executives ultimately concluded that they would need a change in administration to get rid of the requirements, according to the source.
Tesla finds the rules unfair because it believes it reports better data than other automakers, which makes it look like Tesla is responsible for an outsized number of crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems, one of the sources said.
As I've said before, this is what Musk really wants. While the U.S. is long overdue for a federal framework to govern autonomous cars, one that involves less crash reporting overall seems less than ideal.
Mercedes EV Van Promo
On a more pleasant note: who doesn't love a good Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van? Those are some of the best out there. Now, as part of this EV 2.0 push (my term, not theirs) Mercedes is taking its van platform electric, the company announced today:
Starting in 2026, Mercedes-Benz Vans will introduce its newly developed, modular and scalable Van Electric Architecture (VAN.EA). With VAN.EA, Mercedes-Benz is shaping a completely new era of vans.
VAN.EA enables a clear distinction between privately positioned vans in the luxury segment and commercial vans in the premium segment. The future model portfolio of privately positioned vans will range from high-end family vehicles and exclusive VIP shuttles to spacious limousines tailored to the most discerning customers. By extending the top-tier of its product portfolio, Mercedes-Benz Vans is defining its unique own segment.
Cool. Looking forward to seeing it.
Nissan Epoch and Evo concepts
I try not to leave these with ""yes or no"" questions because the discussion is more lively when things are nuanced. But is acquiring Nissan's U.S. apparatus, branding and dealer network a good way in for BYD, Xpeng, Nio or the others?
I was at a Nissan-Kia dealer the other day getting some warranty work done on my EV6. The Nissan side, I'm sorry to say, has a kind of funereal vibe these days. That brand needs any help it can get. What if China saves the day?

America's Public Fast Chargers Have Doubled Since 2020,https://insideevs.com/news/744336/us-public-fast-chargers-doubled-since-2020/,"Yet, electric vehicle sales have grown much faster, leaving a lot to be desired on the charger front.",2024-12-13 10:00:51,"Back in 2021, the U.S. government earmarked $7.5 billion to build out a nationwide network of 500,000 electric vehicle fast-charging stations by 2030. The initiative is part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, falling under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. After a sluggish start, the program is now picking up momentum. There is now an increasing number of operational NEVI-backed stations and America’s charging network itself has doubled since the pandemic.
In addition to the Inflation Reduction Act, the NEVI program is one of the landmark legislations spearheaded by the Biden administration to steer the U.S. away from planet-warming gas cars towards EVs. It aims to develop a comprehensive network of chargers along the country's interstate highways at an average distance of 50 miles between every station. But the rollout of these chargers has been slow, tangled in a cobweb of permitting processes that vary wildly from states to districts and individual counties. There’s no national framework for charger permitting yet, which makes approvals painfully long.
EV skeptics have used the slow rollout for political gains by spreading misinformation and false claims that the Biden administration had blown the entire NEVI budget to construct just a handful of stations. In reality, the $7.5 billion is meant to fund the program’s buildout through 2030. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg even had to explain the basics of how the program works to Donald Trump Jr, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and their millions of followers on social media platform X.
Keeping the political hullabaloo aside, the rollout of chargers and the growth of EV sales has been largely disproportionate.
America’s charging network has doubled since 2020, growing from 96,190 publicly available Level 2 and DC fast-charging ports to over 200,000 today. Charging companies like Tesla, Electrify America, ChargePoint, and EVgo have helped build out this network. That’s a significant achievement, but it pales in comparison to EV sales growth. Sales of fully electric models more than quadrupled between 2020 and 2023, as per Edmunds.
With the NEVI-backed stations on the brink of mass deployment, they can help plug this massive gulf to a certain extent, assuming the incoming Trump administration doesn’t reverse the course.
The first NEVI-funded charging port went live last year. According to the Joint Office’s latest update, there are now 240 active ports across 14 states. There’s also a newly established NEVI dashboard to help netizens track the program’s progress. The dashboard reveals that every U.S. state has an approved plan to roll out chargers. So far, 36 states have awarded contracts to charging companies and 11 states have at least one operational NEVI-funded station. An additional 25,000 federally funded ports are in the works.
In another key update, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also recently issued a revision to the NEVI program. It now allows the Tesla connector, also known as the North American Charging Standard or the J3400 port, to be added to new or existing stations using NEVI funds. All major U.S. automakers have agreed to adopt the Tesla standard to open up access to thousands of Superchargers to their EV customers. States now may also use NEVI funds for Level 2, medium and heavy-duty and off-corridor EV chargers, as per the revision.
The future of EV charging could swing either way. The anti-subsidy sentiment is running high in the incoming Trump administration. Yet, Tesla is the third biggest beneficiary of NEVI funds, as per the newly released dashboard. Either way, road-tripping in an EV seems on track to be awesome and hassle-free—just how fast that will happen is an open question. Even if NEVI is rolled back, the charging network will likely keep growing, but probably at a slower pace.

"EV Motorcycle Maker Stark Future Just Changed The Game, Again",https://www.rideapart.com/news/743925/stark-future-2025-varg-ex-enduro-street-legal/,Who's ready to rock some single track well into the night?,2024-12-25 01:25:23,"I've been dying to get my hands on a Stark Varg, the all-electric dirt bike that has taken the world by storm, as everyone who's ridden one has come away with the same expletive-filled approvals. They usually involve saying, ""WTF, how is this so good?"" all while having the same manic smile plastered across their faces. 80 electric horsepower in a 250cc package tends to do that to you. Or so I'm told.
But the one motorcycle I've been waiting for Stark Future to build is a street-legal enduro bike. A motorcycle that I could take on some backcountry single track, go hunting or scouting, or use to engage in some off-road shenanigans. Something with a headlight for when the sun inevitably sinks below the horizon. Welp, my prayers have been answered. Say hello to the Stark Varg EX.
What's cool about the Varg EX is that, essentially, it's just a Varg with a number plate and lights. Nothing else has really been changed on the base dirt bike that everyone can't shut up about. It still claims 80 horsepower from its 7.2 kWh honeycomb magnesium battery. The one thing Stark did change, however, was to tune it to deliver 20 percent more range than the motocrosser, which translates to a max 6 hours of riding in certain modes.
Charging, however, only takes two hours via a 240v outlet. [So it's claimed, anyway.jj]
According to Stark, the Varg EX will be legal in multiple locales, stating, ""Riders can legally take it on thestreets in countries across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States. With A1 license compatibility and even car-license accessibility in Southern Europe, the VARG EX is set to broaden the appeal of Enduro riding.""
That's in large part due to the addition of a 4,000-lumen headlight, indicators and brake lights, as well as Stark's new ""Arkenstone"" display. This bit is Android-powered, and gives you navigation, turn-by-turn GPS trail recording, access to the bike's modes, engine braking, and regenerative brake settings, as well as ""community sharing options to upload and follow rider trails."" Neat.
Stark will also let customers personalize their Varg EXs with a host of add-ons, including titanium footpegs, bolts, and shafts to reduce weight, five tire options covering both tube and tubeless, Brembo brakes, and adjustable handlebars and foot pegs. Likewise, you can either get the base Varg EX with 60 horsepower or the Alpha with the full 80 horsepower. You know which one I'd get.
According to Stark's CEO and Founder Anton Wass, ""The VARG EX embodies everything we stand for at Stark Future. It’s designed to challenge and inspire the motorcycle industry to embrace sustainability by proving that electric technology can outperform gas in every aspect. With the VARG EX, we’re creating a bike that opens up new possibilities for riders, whether it’s conquering trails, commuting through the city, or simply riding anywhere, anytime.""
As for price, the Standard Varg EX will set you back $12,900. The Alpha version costs another $1,000 on top of that, for a total price of $13,900. Pre-orders are now open, and I'm having a real hard time not grabbing one myself. As I've spoken about in the past, the best place for electric motorcycles is the dirt, and this looks possibly perfect for what I do and love.
I really need to get on one ASAP.

Crazy Renault 5 Turbo 3E Is Headed To Production,https://insideevs.com/news/744326/renault-5-turbo-3e-production-specs-ev/,"The French are once again turning the craziness dial to 11. Meet the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a rear-wheel drive super hatch.",2024-12-13 08:19:53,"French automakers have a knack for making weird stuff that sometimes turns out to be extremely interesting. The Citroen SM rings a bell, and so does the original Renault 5. The latter went through several iterations, but probably the most recognizable of them all is the properly bonkers Renault 5 Turbo, a mid-engined rally-bred fire-breathing hatchback that was good for 120 miles per hour.
Well, the R5 Turbo is back, albeit for the electric age. This is the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a battery-powered super hatchback based on the recently revealed series-production city EV. But here’s the kicker, the Turbo 3E is also going into production, which gets our stamp of approval for serious craziness on Renault’s part.
It takes a lot of courage to bring something like this on the market, especially in Europe where things haven’t been going quite as well on the EV front as some manufacturers had hoped. But here comes Renault with a car that looks like it was envisioned by a 10-year-old after watching too much old-school rally footage.
More French Stuff
But enough of that. What’s under the skin of this thing? Quite a lot as it turns out, and its powertrain configuration is rather interesting. The Renault 5 Turbo 3E has two electric motors housed in the rear wheels. Combined, they put out over 500 horsepower, enough for a zero to 62 miles per hour sprint in just 3.5 seconds.
There’s no word on what battery will power this electric pocket rocket, or how much time will be needed to replenish said battery. But does it really matter? Look at it! It’s significantly wider than the standard Renault 5, with tires so skinny you’d be forgiven for thinking they could hold next to no air. There’s also a delightful nod to the original R5 Turbo and Turbo 2 of the 1980s in the form of side-mounted air vent lookalikes. In the originals, they fed fresh air to the combustion engine, and in the modern reinterpretation, one of those vents hides the charging port.
There are no photos of the interior, but we expect a familiar look as the tamer Renault 5, with dual screens and a touch of exuberance. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will have “performance worthy of a supercar or even a hypercar.” There’s no launch date yet, but we expect it to become a reality sometime in 2026. Bring it!",Iulian Dnistran
2025 Toyota BZ4X Gets A Huge Discount And 0% APR,https://insideevs.com/news/744283/2025-toyota-bz4x-discount-lease-pricing/,The new model year isn’t even on dealer lots yet and Toyota is already offering massive discounts for its sole EV in the U.S.,2024-12-13 03:06:56,"Toyota hasn’t said a thing about the upcoming 2025 bZ4X electric crossover. The car isn’t even on dealer lots yet–although it should get there by the end of this year–but the Japanese automaker is already offering a huge discount and very attractive leasing and financing options for the yet-to-be-released EV.
Let’s get that discount out of the way first. Through January 6, the 2025 Toyota bZ4X is available with a $10,000 lease cash discount in many regions, such as Denver, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and San Francisco. In other areas like the Gulf States and Cincinnati, the lease cash discount drops to $7,500, according to auto intelligence website CarsDirect, which is obviously less but still sizeable.
There’s more, though. When leasing, Toyota is offering rates equivalent to 0% (a money factor of 0.00001), which sure sounds like the automaker is keen on getting these EVs off dealer lots even before they get there from the factory.
More bZ4X Stuff
If financing is more your thing, there’s a good deal to be had, too. The 2025 bZ4X has 0% APR for a 72-month term and, on top of that, Toyota Financial is throwing in a $2,500 rebate that goes by the name TFS Finance Subvention cash. This is only available when financing, but it can be stacked with the 0% APR deal.
With all this being said, Toyota has some even more attractive offers for the outgoing 2024 bZ4X. In most regions, dealers are offering a $16,500 lease incentive and a money factor equivalent to 0%. In some cases, you could get a brand-new Toyota EV for just $219 per month for 36 months with a $2,999 down payment.
That’s a very hard offer to beat. However, wannabe shoppers might want to take into account the fact that the bZ4X isn’t exactly a record-breaking EV by any stretch of the imagination. With a maximum EPA-rated range of 252 miles and a maximum DC fast charging rate of 150 kilowatts, it's perfectly average in terms of electric performance. The current 2024 bZ4X starts at $44,465. It can be had with either a 201-horsepower front-wheel drive setup or a 214-hp dual-motor all-wheel drive configuration.",Iulian Dnistran
Bolt-On Solar Array Might Add Up To 20 Miles Of Range Per Day To Any EV,https://insideevs.com/news/744228/dartsolar-ev-solar-panels-range/,Who said you couldn’t build your own Aptera-like solar EV?,2024-12-12 15:00:05,"The name “Aptera” might ring a bell if you’ve been following the electric vehicle space for the past couple of years. The California-based startup has been working on a commercial solar EV or SEV for some time now. Its three-wheeled car is covered with solar panels that could, in theory, replenish the battery to offer up to 30 miles of driving range per day, for free.
That car, however, still seems like a distant dream, despite its makers claiming it will be ready for prime time “soon.” That said, it’s an interesting proposition, and now there’s another startup promising to harness the power of the sun to power an EV. Any EV, in this case.
Los Angeles-based DartSolar put together an expanding solar roof rack that could be fitted to any battery-powered car on the road, boosting its range while the owner is out shopping or chilling on the beach.
More Stuff Like This
The setup includes six low-profile photovoltaic panels, each with a rated power of 160 watts. This means the total power rating is 960 watts, but it’s up to the owner to choose how much juice they need. In its fully closed position, just two panels are exposed to the sun, which means a maximum of 320 W can be produced. This layout can reportedly be used all the time, including while driving.
If more power is needed, the other four panels are on sliders and the array can be expanded–two in the front and two in the back. The panels are fitted to a lightweight aluminum frame and the whole thing, including the roof bars, weighs 87 pounds.
So how does this invention send power to the car’s battery? Well, it’s simple: the solar array is connected to an external power pack–in one of the promo videos, it looks suspiciously like an EcoFlow Delta. Then, using a Level 1 or Level 2 EV charger, the owner can transfer power from the mobile battery to the car’s battery.
DartSolar says its setup works with any battery backup brand, which is not exactly surprising, seeing how DIY-ers around the world have been using similar setups for off-grid power use in remote locations for years.
The startup claims its system can add anywhere from 10 to 20 miles of range per day to any EV, seeing how it estimates a total energy output of around 5 kWh per day. The kit includes 3D printable parts and stainless steel telescopic tubes, and the expected lifetime of the whole thing is over 10 years.
The full price, including the backup battery, is $3,450. However, the startup has an early-bird promotion where potential customers can reserve the setup for a refundable fee of $99 and then pay another $2,950 when the product is ready to ship next year. DartSolar also says that some customers might be eligible for a 30% rebate in the form of tax credits.",Iulian Dnistran
"Why We Got Our Tesla Cybertruck Testers From Turo, Not Tesla",https://insideevs.com/news/744232/tesla-cybertruck-press-cars/,Tesla doesn't operate like other automakers. That makes testing one a bit more complicated.,2024-12-12 14:00:15,"There's a weird relationship at the heart of car reviews. Dealers largely won't let us drive cars for more than an hour, and that's not enough for a review. We'd love to buy every car we drive, but anyone suggesting that's possible doesn't really understand the economics of the modern digital media business. That means we have to turn to manufacturer-provided loaners, a compromise we aim to consistently note via our ""Full Disclosure"" section of the review. Yet that strategy doesn't work for Tesla.
The company does everything differently. While other automakers have press teams to handle inquiries from the media and, in most cases, provide loaners, Tesla merely provides a generic press@Tesla.com email address. It's effectively a wishing well. You throw questions and requests in, and nothing comes out.
The Breakthrough Awards
Tesla used to do this, back in the 2010s. Certain members of the current InsideEVs team got access to cars like the Model S and Model 3 when they were brand-new, writing for other outlets. But since CEO Elon Musk dissolved the Tesla press team, that's a no-go for us.
Now, Tesla does seem to loan some cars to so-called influencers, certain large magazines and outlets in Europe; its press team allowed us a new Model 3 for review in Europe because the company still interfaces with journalists over there. But here in the U.S., it's radio silence for all communications with the media: requests for comment, press releases, updates on new products and, yes, cars to test.
Some Tesla fans may see this as a victory over companies that are too buddy-buddy with the press. I get it. If you're trying to be ethical in this business, this sort of thing is a minefield and it's often abused.
The conflicts regarding reviewing a product you get for free are substantial, and I devote large parts of my efforts here to making sure we remain fair and free of outside influence on our reviews. I hope that comes through. I'm proud of the fact that our reviews are harsh when necessary, glowing when appropriate and always honest representations of what the author actually thinks. We don't pull punches.
The last thing I want to do is come off as entitled by complaining that a certain company won't give us free cars to test, either. But as an InsideEVs reader, you should know this makes it difficult to learn anything about what Tesla is doing. If we want to try out the latest software, or version of Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, or see what the updates to the Model 3 Highland and upcoming Model Y Juniper are like, we're basically out of luck. That can make the largest EV manufacturer in the world a kind of black box more often than we'd like.
Tesla's approach, unfortunately, guarantees that no one can do the sort of in-depth reporting that we do on other automakers. If we have a technical question about an engineering decision, a factual question about company policies or a genuine curiosity about something new, we can go kick rocks. Tesla isn't picking up the phone.
That makes it nigh-impossible to combat misinformation about the company—which abounds—as the one source that could refute a claim will never engage. When the company does communicate with the public, it does so through Elon Musk's X account, which often bears no resemblance to the truth (and unlike in the 2010s, has very little to do with Tesla these days.)
Lately, what we've seen is that the few people who are allowed to talk to Tesla executives or review their products with company demo cars, are sometimes the most fawning, hand-selected ""critics"" Tesla knows.
InsideEVs doesn't make that list. That means that if we want to experience the cars, we have to get them ourselves. Fair play.
The company doesn't owe us test cars; frankly, none do. But Tesla forces us to treat its products differently from others, so I wanted to lay out my thinking on the issue. If you think there's a better way, don't shy away from telling me. My email is below.
The first option is to borrow a car from readers. That is the fairest option on paper, as it doesn't require us to take discounts or rentals from other companies. But there's another moral tie-up there. I like our readers. I love the many, many readers who have volunteered to give us time in their cars, at no cost and with no strings attached. You are all so kind, and so well-intentioned. That there is the problem.
Because what happens, then, if I hate your car? If you're a Cybertruck owner who gives us a car out of the kindness of your heart, it'll be pretty hard for me to say the Cybertruck is a car you mostly buy for attention, even if I think that's true. Though there's no direct financial relationship there, there's an emotional one.
Plus, the liability of driving a private owner's car on company business is a nightmare. Most importantly, we can't really bother a reader's personal car for a week, and if we only drive for an hour it's hard to tell you anything you can't learn in a test drive.
We tested Cybertrucks all over the country for our Breakthrough Awards this year.
So there's one option if we want to spend a few days with a specific model. We use Turo. For the unfamiliar, Turo allows you to rent cars from private owners (and small businesses that use the site), and its key selling point is the ability to rent a specific car. So instead of getting a ""Chrysler Pacifica or similar"" that turns out to be a Mitsubishi Mirage, we can rent a specific Cyberbeast or Model S Plaid. And we pay for this ourselves.
It's the best solution, one that allows me to criticize a car freely while still providing something to the owner to make it worth their time. The one issue is that owners set the price, and for a hot new product like the Cybertruck loans can be expensive. When I drove one back in February, it was about $1,000 per day, plus extras. Then we have to insure it, and multiply that out by the six Breakthrough Awards judges we had and... oh my. This is why—full disclosure—we also work with Turo to get a discount in certain cases, particularly for bigger projects like this. Because of that, we also mention that we get the cars on Turo. I hope that's an acceptable compromise.
We're free to criticize the cars as needed, to drive them hundreds of miles and get real-world experience in them. The owner gets paid, Turo gets some publicity and Tesla doesn't have to lift a finger. I think it's a win-win-win for us, the readers and Turo, but I'm open to other suggestions.
And if you have any personal complaints about me, feel free to send them to press@Tesla.com. I'm sure someone will read them eventually.

"Callum’s New EV Is A $100,000+ Lightweight Buggy And Sports Car Mix",https://insideevs.com/news/744084/callum-skye-lightweight-buggy-ev/,The upcoming battery-powered 2+2 has been designed to appeal to Americans living on the West Coast.,2024-12-12 13:00:45,"Ian Callum is most known for his 20-year stint as Jaguar’s chief of design, which lasted until 2019. Now he’s set up his own eponymous company, and its first ground-up new model is a very unusual-looking cross between a buggy and a sports car, which promises to be exceptionally light for an electric vehicle.
The Callum Skye weighs just over 2,500 pounds (1,150 kilograms) even with a 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack (good for a claimed range of 170 miles) and two electric motors. The dual-motor setup, which makes the Skye all-wheel drive, doesn’t have an especially high output—just 247 hp and 221 pound-feet—but its low weight, good traction and instant power delivery will make accelerating off the line very quick.
Autocar talked to Ian Callum (whose last project at Jaguar was the stillborn electric XJ) about his latest creation, and the designer noted that it “is not just a pretty street car. It’s going to have real off-road capability. We’ve been working on this for two years so far, and now we're ready to start developing prototypes. So now is the right time to let the world see it, and we’ll be in production within two years.”
The Skye will be a very limited-series vehicle, with only between 50 and 250 examples being built annually starting in 2026. Its price is estimated to be between $100,000 and $140,000, and it’s billed as good on both tarmac and dirt roads.
It looks the way it does because, according to Ian Callum, it is “a West Coast of America-inspired car. It’s an off-road car, it’s a sand car, it’s a mud car, and I think the West Coast will be where a lot of our customers are based.” It will be available in two versions called ""The Dynamic"" and ""The Capable.""
The Dynamic
The Capable
The first will have a lower ground clearance and tires that maximize its performance on the tarmac and doors. The Capable will be something like an electric Ariel Nomad, with no doors, a taller ride height and off-road tires, which should make it far better at taking you over unpaved roads.
Inside, the Skye has a 2+2 layout, meaning it has two seats for the front occupants and two smaller rear seats for occasional use. It has a central infotainment screen (with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility) placed atop the dashboard, but facing the driver are traditional analog dials that not only show speed but also battery and drive unit temperature, power usage and state of charge. The steering wheel features a strap instead of a third prong, similar to the new Mini Cooper SE.

Global EV Survey: 92% Of EV Drivers Won’t Return To  Gas Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/744035/ev-owners-survey-global/,Switching to an electric car apparently ruins combustion cars for the vast majority of owners.,2024-12-12 12:00:00,"Electric vehicles are quiet, fast and packed with tech, and these advantages leave a lasting impression on owners. Very few of them, if any, would switch back to a combustion car after going electric, at least according to a new study published by the Global EV Alliance, which we also featured in today's Critical Materials.
It compiled responses from 23,000 EV owners in 18 countries (including the U.S., Brazil, and key European markets) and found that 92% of respondents said they would stick to electric cars for their next car purchase. Of those who would not choose a pure EV again, just 1% would go back to gasoline or diesel, and 4% would pick a plug-in hybrid. A study published this summer said only one in five Americans would choose an EV over a combustion car or a hybrid.
Petter Haugneland, Assistant Secretary General of The Norwegian EV Association, is quoted in the study as saying, “These results confirm that EV drivers are highly satisfied with their choice and that reports of declining EV popularity are greatly exaggerated.” Haugneland is referring to the many reports published this year pointing to falling EV popularity, even though the number of EVs bought in most markets actually went up in 2024.
The survey also polled respondents about why they chose an EV. The top three responses cited EVs’ lower operating costs, more climate-friendly running and lack of operating noise. It also found that 72% of those questioned said they charged at home, only 13% said they used a public fast charging network, and only 7% said they used public parking AC chargers.
When they were asked if, in their view, EVs presented any downsides, the most popular response was that they didn’t, followed by “the coverage of fast chargers is poor,” “charging is time-consuming” and “chargers are often out of function.”
EV drivers in Brazil strongly agreed with the idea that taking a long trip in an EV required more planning than in an ICE car, while respondents from Germany, Switzerland and Sweden didn’t see much of a difference. Regarding range anxiety, EV drivers in India and Brazil felt most affected, while German and Swiss drivers said it wasn’t an issue. Interestingly, Norwegian EV drivers reported above-average range anxiety.
Queuing while waiting to fast-charge is a real problem in areas where the expansion of charging networks couldn’t keep up with rising EV popularity. However, only 3% of respondents said they experienced this often, while 40% and 28% said it was rarely or never a problem for them. A more common problem is chargers occasionally not working, which was reported by 27% of those polled, and 5% said it happened often.
Over 50% also strongly agreed that you should simply be able to tap your card to pay for charging and not have to download a specific app for each charging network. However, that’s a goal that will require a lot more standardization of charging protocols, which will probably have to be imposed by a central authority since the charging providers would currently much rather just have you download their app.
Norway is still the world leader in EV adoption by quite a margin, and it’s the first country where EVs will soon outnumber combustion cars on the road. In November, EVs held a 94% share of the new car market in the wealthy northern European nation (up from 81% last year), and the best-selling cars this year were the Tesla Model Y, followed in second spot by the Model 3.
Plug-ins are also surging in popularity in China, where 1 million hybrids and plug-ins were delivered just in August alone, of which 582,813 were pure BEVs and 444,270 were PHEVs. China is also home to some of the world’s most prolific EV manufacturers, which are now trying to expand their sales success outside the People’s Republic into Europe and the Americas, although newly imposed import tariffs have affected their plans to a degree.
U.S. EV sales are also on an upward trend, as shown by the Q3 sales record, which marked a 5% improvement over Q2. EVs made up 8.9% of all new car sales in the previous quarter, up from 7.8% in Q3 2023, according to data presented by Cox Automotive. Another report says non-plug-in hybrids saw a significant sales boost and helped offset EVs’ slightly lower share of the entire light-duty vehicle market, which went down from 7.4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3, although the number of EVs sold is still higher than in 2023.
EV owners seem to really love their vehicles, even when they are not perfect. While this has been true for Tesla for many years, it now applies to Rivian more. The brand was ranked last for reliability in a recent Consumer Reports survey, but it came first overall in owner satisfaction. Here’s what someone who switched to a Rivian after almost four years of owning a Tesla thinks of the former.
Tesla used to be the satisfaction leader among EV manufacturers, but now it’s been dethroned by Rivian, surpassing established automakers with decades of car-building experience. Non-plug-in hybrids and combustion cars without electrification still provided owners with the highest satisfaction, according to another survey by Consumer Reports. However, EVs are still better than PHEVs in this respect.

Electric BMW M3 Shows Its Camouflaged Face For The First Time,https://insideevs.com/news/744184/bmw-electric-m3-teaser/,"It promises to deliver exhilarating performance thanks to a quad-motor layout when it arrives in 2027, but its looks may be polarizing.",2024-12-12 11:00:01,"BMW’s sporty Motorsport division is preparing to launch its first fully electric vehicle, and it’s begun building the hype even though the first one doesn’t arrive until 2027. After confirming the quad-motor layout of its upcoming electric M cars and how it wowed executives during an internal drive event, BMW is now teasing the first M EV, which will be based on the upcoming i3 sedan.
The i3 name will likely be repurposed to designate BMW’s new fully electric Neue Klasse (it already calls its G20 3 Series EV for China the i3), and iM3 or i3M seem like the most plausible names for the hot version. According to BMW Blog, there will be several variants of the i3M with power outputs ranging from 670 horsepower to double that in the most potent and hardcore quad-motor variant.
This suggests that base versions will be rear-wheel-drive. However, they may still have the same advanced torque vectoring characteristics thanks to a dual-motor configuration, and you should get it to misbehave pretty easily and turn its rear rubber into smoke. Even in the quad-motor variants, you will likely have a drift mode that sets the car up for maximum side slip. In today’s all-wheel-drive M cars, you can disconnect the front axle if you only want to slide around.
Bearing the internal codename ZA0, the electric M3 equivalent will be the first of its kind, but it will likely be followed by a two-door coupe (M4 equivalent) and an SUV to serve as an electric X3M. BMW’s latest teaser shots tell us a lot about what the M3 EV will look like, featuring design elements from Neue Klasse concepts and Motorsport design staples like blistered wheel arches and a deep chin spoiler.
From the side, you notice the camouflaged prototype doesn’t have the traditional M3 proportions, though. Its front section looks less like it’s hiding a big longitudinally mounted engine and more like that of a front-wheel-drive car. The front overhang looks pretty large too, and the overall design doesn’t appear as elegant as any current BMW sedan.
Hopefully, once the camo gets peeled off, what will be revealed is a sedan that’s pleasing to look at, but so far, its side profile isn’t convincing. It does have a sporty and purposeful stance with its flared-out fenders, but it seems like it wants to break with decades of design tradition, and this may backfire.
We also noticed the camouflaged prototype had what appear to be motorized, flush-fitting door handles, and the car is likely wearing its production body but with some placeholder parts like the front and rear light clusters. Even the stick-on fender flares appear to be the production parts since they resemble the ones on the current M3. Like on today’s M3, the upcoming EV doesn’t appear to have bespoke doors to go with the widened arches, an area of the car that has drawn much criticism.
The electric M3 was penned by Domagoj Dukec, who was at the helm of BMW’s design department and probably signed off on more controversial designs than Chris Bangle. Now, he’s been promoted to become the design director at Rolls-Royce, but his legacy will be felt until the end of the decade when Neue Klasse models will be receiving their mid-lifecycle refresh, and we’re not sure it’s a positive one.
Maybe once the camo comes off, it will reveal a much prettier shape than we’re seeing right now. While for many, the mere fact that BMW M is going electric might be shocking enough (pun intended), we’ve known about that for years. We're excited about that, but what raises some questions for us is the design. Let us know your thoughts on the camouflaged electric M3 and whether the whole Neue Klasse design language is successful.

Tesla Quietly Lobbied For Strict Emission Regulations As Musk Eyes Dismantling Others,https://insideevs.com/news/744114/tesla-uk-emissions-mandate-lobbied/,"Plus, the Cybertruck could be coming to China and Ferrari says it will always build its cars—even EVs—in Italy.",2024-12-12 10:00:53,"Tesla's CEO is no stranger to government regulation. He's talked ad nauseam about the sweeping fines his companies have received, the hoops Tesla's autonomy programs need to go through for approval, and the inefficiencies that he intends to correct alongside the incoming administration. And all that aside, Tesla still pushes for stricter regulation when it could mean enforcement in its favor.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Tesla's mission to convince the UK to tighten emission regulations, Cybertruck China launch looking like a possibility, and Ferrari's plans to always keep its production in Italy. Let's jump in.
Tesla has been quietly lobbying the U.K.'s Labor Party in an effort to further vehicle emission mandates on passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The finding comes from The Fast Charge newsletter, which uncovered a private letter penned by Tesla to the British government via freedom of information laws.
An analysis of the letter shows Tesla's EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) unit urging the British government to not just maintain course with its current directive for zero-emissions vehicles but to consider increasing mandates for both passenger cars and Heavy Goods Vehicles (semi-trucks) ""as soon as possible.""
The letter, which was authored in July, comes to light just after the UK government announced that it would loosen regulations on its ZEV mandate (in stark contrast to Tesla's ask) despite staying the course for a 2030 phase-out of combustion-only passenger cars. The government's decision came after pushback from major automakers revealed projected costs of around $7.6 billion related to the mandate in 2024 alone and a warning that the continued rapid momentum could threaten the UK's status as a manufacturing hub.
In its letter, Tesla says that the UK is ""falling behind"" at its current pace.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been a large proponent of setting fire to what he calls ""nonsense regulations."" In fact, it's a core promise that he's instilled in the formation of the new program he's tasked with co-leading in the U.S. under the incoming Trump administration, the Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk pledged to push for sweeping deregulation of ""government overreach,"" of which he has scrutinized the U.S. government for imposing on his vast array of companies—often for environmental-related infractions.
For example, SpaceX was recently fined $148,378 for wastewater violations, The Boring Company received a small fine in Texas for erecting an air-polluting facility without authorization, and Tesla settled with the EPA for $275,000 in 2022 over violations of the Clean Air Act in California as well as a $1.5 million settlement earlier this year to 25 separate counties regarding the mishandling of hazardous waste across the state. Separately, Tesla is repeatedly in hot water with the German government over pollution stemming from Giga Berlin, including claims that the factory has contaminated drinking water with ""six times more hazardous pollutants into the water system than its permits allow.""
And, of course, we can't ignore the timing here, either. Tesla seems to be gearing up for a potential European launch of the Tesla Semi—something it debuted seven years ago in the U.S. and has yet to reach large-scale production for commercial customers in its home market. Trucks were spotted at Tesla's German Gigafactory back in August, just a few months after Musk said that ""it makes sense to produce the Semi truck ... at Giga Berlin.""
Tesla also has a long punch card of taking advantage of government-sponsored funds to grow its business. From the same types of Department of Energy loans that it recently slammed rival Rivian for, to selling off regulatory tax credits for billions of dollars in revenue, and even building a version of its Model 3 with just 94 miles of range to qualify for a Canadian tax credit—Tesla is no stranger to utilizing government programs to its benefit. And if given the opportunity to push policy in its favor, why stop now?
Perspective is everything here. On the one hand, Tesla's push for more emissions moves progress towards a cleaner future with more sustainable cars, a mission that Tesla has claimed to support from the start. But on the other, it's impossible to disregard the hypocrisy of proposing more rules abroad in the name of progress while also promising to tear them down at home—regulation for thee, if it benefits me.
Tesla's polarizing Cybertruck could soon be hitting the streets of China. A new certification from the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology suggests that Tesla could be interested in launching its EV pickup in the Far East despite previously denouncing the possibility.
The automaker began shipping over a small army of Cybertrucks to China in January. However, Tesla wasn't bringing the trucks there to sell—instead, it was just a tease to show off its shiny metal marvel in a market where it couldn't be sold and had no plans of homologation. Well, until recently, that is. A new report from CNEV suggests that Tesla could be in the early phases of launching the product in one of its biggest markets.
Here's what CNEV has to say:
Tesla made a filing with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) to measure the energy consumption of the Cybertruck, and today it received an Automobile Energy Consumption Label.

[...]

Tesla is making improvements to the Cybertruck to comply with domestic market access requirements for pedestrian collision protection, local media outlet Yiche said in a report today, without mentioning further details.

It's worth noting that obtaining the Automobile Energy Consumption Label is just one of a number of compliance efforts car companies need to do for a model in China. The Cybertruck's receipt of the label may not necessarily mean that it will be introduced to China anytime soon.
This news comes as a bit of a surprise given how adamant Tesla has been that it wouldn't bring the Cybertruck to the Chinese market. Just days ago, Tesla's media team in China squashed the rumor. According to CNEV, which cites a report from another local publication, Tesla reportedly said it had ""no plans"" to launch the truck in China.
For argument's sake, there are a few good reasons why this could be the case. For starters, China classifies pickups as light trucks and imposes significantly more restrictions than passenger cars and SUVs. For example, light trucks are not permitted to exceed 62 MPH at highway speeds, often have restrictions on local roads, and may require tweaks to the body for safety regulations. And perhaps the biggest blow of all is that China's road laws require light trucks to be scrapped after 15 years of use.
CEO Elon Musk has also touched on the subject in the past. Musk mentioned that it would be ""very difficult"" to bring the truck into compliance with the overseas market:
Whether or not the Cybertruck actually makes it to China is anybody's guess right now. However, the fact that Tesla went through the trouble of obtaining an Automobile Energy Consumption Label is a step towards the possibility of seeing these shiny steel trapezoids hitting some more foreign streets. Plus, let's be real, Tesla could use an uplift from other countries to make the Cybertruck a success and keep its EV crown away from BYD. It seemingly blew through its backlog of U.S. reservation holders in just months which led to a quick launch in Canada and Mexico.
Automakers across the globe are worried about what the next era of Trump could mean for industry tariffs. The incoming administration has threatened to levy heavy duty fees on imports of all kinds—that is, of course, unless goods are built domestically. It's only natural that the uncertainty of tariffs and federal support for EVs has the auto industry shaking in their boots.
Well, that is, of course, unless you're Ferrari—then you know that your customers aren't sweating about a few thousand bucks for tariffs. In fact, the prancing horse is so certain that any potential tariffs won't impact its sales that it will continue to make all of its vehicles in Italy, including its first EV that's due to hit the streets next year.
That confirmation comes straight from the mouth of Ferrari's CEO, Benedetto Vigna. The former tech bro turned automotive head knows what the brand's customers want, and that's a made-in-Maranello Ferrari.
""We make cars in Maranello,"" said at Reuter's NEXT conference. ""We will sell cars in U.S., but we will make cars in Maranello.""
Ferrari sold 3,262 cars in the U.S. last year, which is about a quarter of the total number of vehicles it produced in 2023. Impressively, nearly half of those sales were hybrids—and future Ferrari buyers are undoubtedly ready to throw piles of cash at the brand's first EV (which, by the way, will receive a last-minute final price but is expected to cost upwards of $525,000).
And while Trump hasn't explicitly said that Europe would be subject to his tariff plans, European automakers fear that it will be just a matter of time, especially since Canada and Mexico could be subject to additional tariffs of up to 25% despite being the U.S.'s largest trading partners.
Ferrari, however, knows its customers and is largely unfazed by any such existential threat.
""Our order book is pretty strong,"" said Vigna. ""He decides what to do here, we will cope with those new rules... there will be tariffs for us, for everyone. It's good because when you have the realities changing around you, it's a way to foster more and more innovation.""
A Ferrari isn't a logical purchase—it's an emotional one. You buy one for status, you buy one for speed, you buy one because it's a Ferrari. It's not like you're cross-shopping an SF90 and a Toyota Camry. So what are a few thousand, or tens of thousands (or more), dollars when you're already spending Ferrari money?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
We talk about the future of the EV industry a lot. It's actually kind of insane how intertwined the entire field is with politics. You know, tariff-this, or EV-tax-credit-that—it's kind of exhausting what kind of mental gymnastics go into the entire automobile manufacturing business and it makes me wonder if a blanket ""all or none"" policy would be in the consumer's best interest.
Should the U.S. implement an all-or-none policy for tariffs? On the EV tax credit? On Both?
Now, I know there's a lot more than what's on the surface here. But let me know your thoughts and reasoning in the comments. I'll be reading.

These Yamaha E-Bike Designs For Carrying Kids Look Sketchy As Hell,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743642/yamaha-ebike-carrying-kids-sketchy/,But they make perfect sense in the proper environment.,2024-12-25 01:25:27,"All over the world, electric bicycles have changed the way people move. They’re simple, practical, and just easy to use to get around. And while wide, sprawling highways in the US are undoubtedly one of the biggest hurdles to their stateside success, in other parts of the world, electric bicycles have become very much integrated into the mainstream mobility network.
That's perhaps why these new e-bikes from Yamaha may seem totally sketchy to you. Both the PAS Baby and PAS Kiss e-bikes seem to put your youngster in a rather precarious position, exposing them to all sorts of dangers on the road. For starters, the PAS Baby, which has the child seat in the rear, keeps your toddler out of sight as you pilot the two-wheeler through the urban jungle. Surely, should an inattentive driver busy with their smartphone come hurtling towards you and your youngster, you’re in for a terrible time.
But the story isn’t much different with the PAS Kiss, either. Here, the child is strapped onto the bike’s front end, sort of like a handlebar ornament for the world to see. Should the rider need to come to a sudden stop, or should the brakes be engaged, one would think that a massive stoppie would ensure that would result in the kid being pinned underneath the bike and mommy thrown over the bars.
While all these gloomy scenarios are indeed within the realm of possibility, it’s important to remember that Yamaha’s e-bikes are designed, first and foremost, to be used in cities that already have the infrastructure for bicycle commuting.
Indeed, riding an e-bike with your toddler strapped to the front or back seems a lot safer if there aren’t any cars and trucks hurtling past you at 60 miles per hour. It also helps a whole lot if the environment in which you’re riding is clean, well-paved, and you know, actually designed for bikes. And all these are realities in many countries around the world, particularly in Europe and Asia, where governments are working towards making active mobility mainstream.
Then of course, there’s the topic of design. Yamaha has made sure that the PAS Baby and PAS Kiss are as safe as they could possibly be. To do this, the Japanese manufacturer incorporated a new compact frame which offers a lower center of gravity for improved stability. The PAS Baby’s child seat has also been redesigned. It’s called the Hug Seat Plus, and as its name suggests, it’s designed to keep your youngster tightly secured as the bike is in motion. It uses a race car-like seat complete with a harness and a halo to protect your kid at all costs.
Meanwhile, the PAS Kiss’ front-mounted seat is called the Cocoon Room Plus, and it’s essentially a shell that prevents kids from being crushed in the event of a frontal collision. The bike also gets a fairly long wheelbase for extra stability, as well as to prevent the whole over-the-bar incident I mentioned earlier.
So yeah, in the right context, Yamaha’s e-bikes for ferrying around your kids make perfect sense. But what do you think? Would you ditch your car for an electric bike for school drops and grocery runs if you could? It all seems like a fun and sustainable way forward, and one that could give your youngsters a love for the great outdoors in the process. Share your thoughts in the comments below.

The Toyota Urban Cruiser Returns To Europe As A Compact EV Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/744182/toyota-urban-cruiser-ev-specs-battery-official/,Remember the Scion xD? This is its successor in Europe.,2024-12-12 07:54:06,"Quick history lesson. Ill-fated car brand Scion sold the xD in North America for about six years before being discontinued in the second half of the 2010s. It was a subcompact crossover that was little more than a rebadged Toyota Ist. The Ist was also sold in Europe as the Urban Cruiser. All were powered by small gas engines and slotted below the Rav4.
Well, the Toyota Urban Cruiser nameplate is back, at least in Europe, after an eight-year hiatus. This time around, it’s once again a badge-engineering job, but in the form of an all-electric compact crossover that gets its design inspiration from last year’s Urban SUV concept.
More Toyota EVs
Measuring 168.7 inches long, 70.8 inches wide and 64.5 inches tall, and with a wheelbase of 106.3 inches, the all-new Toyota Urban Cruiser is larger than both the Yaris Cross and C-HR hybrids, but smaller than the bZ4X electric crossover. It’s also the same car underneath as the recently revealed Suzuki e Vitara–same platform, same battery, same electric motors and even the same interior. They’re also built in the same factory in India.
Let’s talk about the powertrain, then. Like its Suzuki counterpart, the Toyota Urban Cruiser is available with either a 49- or 61-kilowatt-hour battery. Both versions are of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) variety. The small pack is only offered in conjunction with a front-mounted electric motor making 142 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque. The large pack can be had with either the 142 hp front motor or a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for a total system output of 181 hp and 221 lb-ft.
Toyota didn’t say anything about the driving range. It did, however, mention that all versions of the Urban Cruiser come as standard with a heat pump and a manually operated pre-heating option for the battery, which should improve efficiency and lower charging times in cold climates. That said, we don’t know how much it would take to recharge the Urban Cruiser’s battery.
The front-wheel drive version gets a Snow Mode to help reduce wheel slip when driving on snow-covered roads, while the all-wheel drive version comes with Downhill Assist control and a Trail Mode which should detect when a wheel is spinning and send torque to the opposite wheel that has more traction.
Standard equipment also includes a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert and lane keep assist. On the dashboard, there’s a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen.
We’ll know more about the new Urban Cruiser after Toyota officially unveils it at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show in January.",Iulian Dnistran
Dust Moto's EV Hightail Dirt Bike Finally Looks Production-Ready,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743534/dust-moto-hightail-electric-ev-dirt-bike-production-debut/,Color us excited.,2024-12-25 01:25:28,"I got an early taste of Dust Moto's prototype electric dirt bike this spring. It was a very short test in my backyard. Further, I had the weight of the company's founders' eyes watching me as I took their one and only prototype for a quick rip.Suffice it to say, I didn't shred as hard as I would've liked.
But from what I felt beneath me, how the bike handled, the power delivery, the dynamics, the brakes, and everything else—albeit at slower speeds than I would've liked—it felt like it had real potential to become what the company envisions: a return to backyard fun.
Now, only a few short months later, Dust Moto is ready to debut the production-ready model and, like the prototype, it looks pretty solid, both in spec and design. It also has a new name: Hightail. Count me in the hype camp as it looks ready to hit your local motocross track, single track, or backyard with a vengeance.
The production Hightail dirt bike is powered by a 4.4-kWh swappable battery pack, delivering a claimed 42 horsepower and 44 pound-feet of torque. I highlight the swappable nature of the battery pack as I, and I don't think I'm alone in this, think that's a brilliant move by Dust Moto.
One of the chief concerns of anyone with EVs is, say it with me, range. But by having an easily swappable battery pack, especially one hooked up to a dirt bike that'll likely see more use on a moto track, means your fun won't stop just because your battery is depleted.
And if you have an extra battery with you when you do go to the track, or even in your backyard, you can swap it out for a fully-charged battery in less time than it would take you to fill up a gas tank.
Adding to the fun that I experienced is the fact that the Hightail weighs just 220 pounds. That's light as hell, especially for that amount of power. Then you add the fully adjustable front and rear suspension, with 10 inches of travel at the front, and 11 inches at the rear, along with chunky tires and beefy brakes—something I wish the Niu had—and you've got the recipe for a seriously good dirt bike. It'd make a helluva backcountry companion chasing elk or deer, too.
Dust Moto is currently accepting pre-orders for the Hightail, with customers only having to drop $100 to save their spot. As for the price, it'll be around $10,000 once it's finally time to pay the company, which isn't bad considering three things: The capability offered, it being an American-made bike, and also the fit and finish.
If you haven't guessed, I'm rooting for these folks, as I think the product has legs. Plus, who doesn't want to have fun in your backyard without pissing off the HOA?

Why GM CEO Mary Barra Is Our 2024 Person Of The Year,https://insideevs.com/news/743774/gm-mary-barra-award-breakthrough/,"It took lots of hard work, and un-learning old habits, to walk back GM’s disastrous electric 2023. Its CEO was up for the challenge.",2024-12-11 15:00:00,"The electric vehicle world is a graveyard of promises. A year ago, it seemed like General Motors might need to pick out a few burial plots of its own there.
The company’s EV battery production plan was way off schedule. Key new electric models kept getting delayed. One of its most important new cars ended the year under a stop-sale order after customers and journalists experienced disastrous software bugs.
Certainly, GM wasn’t alone in looking at the rise of Tesla and China’s electric automakers and saying, “How hard can this be?”, only to get crushed by reality. But adding the zero-emission dreams of America’s largest automaker—and one that once vowed to go all-electric by 2035—to that graveyard felt especially bleak.
Evidently, however, in her 10th year on the job, GM CEO Mary Barra is still up for a good challenge.
(Welcome to The Breakthrough Awards, InsideEVs' year-end awards program recognizing the EVs, people and technologies that are paving the way for our clean energy transition. Read about the awards and the other contenders below.)
The 2024 Breakthrough Awards
In less than 12 months, GM has turned things around to the point where it's a rare bright spot in the EV world, turning out new models all the time and offering some of the best—and only—truly affordable electric options on the market. Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday. That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs’ Breakthrough Awards’ Person Of The Year for 2024.
Business schools also teach stupid things, like how short-term shareholder returns aren’t your most important concern but your only one. Instead, we gave Barra this award for what GM has done for consumers, above all else: the Equinox EV in particular is the affordable, mainstream electric option that American families have been clamoring for. GM, in 2024, helped break the electric car out of the “high-end spaceship” paradigm it’s been stuck in way too long.
GM CEO Mary Barra with the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV
This transformation finally seems to be happening across the board. GM has other great affordable options like the Blazer EV and forthcoming reborn Bolt EUV (which we have little reason to think isn’t on track) and it also offers a growing range of electric trucks, high-end Cadillacs, even a three-row crossover. After 2023’s headaches, Barra certainly delivered on her promise to make 2024 a “year of execution.”
GM NACS
Yet even a good CEO can only do so much herself. It’d be a mistake to say that Barra alone rolled up her sleeves, dug in and cracked the code for fixing all those problems; she is not the person that Elon Musk pretends to be online.
That’s also why she deserves credit for acknowledging, and addressing, one of GM’s greatest historic weaknesses: its insularity. For the longest time, GM's prevailing attitude was that everything produced within the company was better than without, which is why its roster of engineers and managers is so dominated by cradle-to-grave lifers. But in a world defined by batteries and software, some fresh perspectives are necessary right now.
GM brought on Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, veterans of Apple and other companies, to advance its software efforts. It hired former Tesla execs Kurt Kelty and JP Clausen to oversee battery operations and global manufacturing, respectively. There are many more examples of high-profile hires from Tesla, Apple, Google, Lucid and others. That’s a big deal for the General, a company long known for refusing to look outside of itself for answers.
None of that is meant to diminish the considerable talent within GM, of course. It remains one of the greatest engineering firms in the world, and this turnaround could not have happened without its existing talent’s vast carmaking know-how. We’ve spoken to countless engineers and product planners who have worked at GM for decades and have not only been bitten by the electric “bug,” but are determined to win the future. But it takes a leader who can see how all of those components can work together and make sure it happens, and Barra has done that.
2024 Cadillac Lyriq
It continues to impress us that GM’s reversal came at the hands of a CEO who’s been on the job for almost 11 years and is a company “lifer” herself. Maybe it’s because she put herself through college working on a GM assembly line and rose through the ranks overseeing global manufacturing, personnel and product development; she's always been a person who can see how systems should fit together. Barra has been a beacon in countless other ways, including as one of the most powerful women leaders in the world. And besides things like sales and profits and new model launches, there's the stuff that deserves more attention than it gets, like the innovations with the hands-free driving aid Super Cruise or GM Energy’s efforts with charging and electric home power.
We looked closely at the competitive landscape for this award. The Hyundai Motor Group and its leadership came close, as its long-planned commitment to EVs is also paying dividends better than most, but ultimately we voted in favor of GM’s turnaround. By contrast, Ford, an early mover in the EV space and a true innovator at things like charging access, continues to be buried under battery and manufacturing costs. Volkswagen, with the foresight to build EVs in America, should be a leader in most markets but it’s buried in Europe’s carmaking crisis instead. Startups like Lucid and Rivian continue to be impressive in different ways and we see a future where their leadership could also win such an award, but their long-term stability is far from guaranteed. (As for Tesla, it’s unclear who’s even running that show anymore. It has drifted away from whatever stated mission it once had and it is debatable how much time its CEO has actually spent running it this year.)
Granted, GM is not out of the woods. The company's weaknesses and ongoing setbacks were weighed carefully by our judges. GM has still dialed back some of its EV plans and is, at the end of the day, still powered by gas truck profits. We also certainly do not agree with every decision made under Barra’s watch. GM, while profitable, has still done multiple rounds of layoffs this year and last. The decision to kill off the affordable Chevrolet Bolt, however temporary, was a strategic misfire that went against what most Americans are seeking from an EV. We do not see a path to victory in the public eye for the decision not to offer features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We also questioned GM’s ability to truly move at lightning speed like its competitors. Its inability to offer any plug-in hybrids—a technology it pioneered and then abandoned, and under Barra’s watch—until 2027 may be a troubling sign for its agility.
GM CEO Mary Barra at the 2024 Cadillac Celestiq reveal
And as is the nature of a bet, not all of them pay off. As we saw just last week, GM still has its work cut out in China, let alone for the day when companies like BYD and Xpeng and Nio arrive on GM’s home turf. The evening before this story was published, Barra announced GM was throwing in the towel on its Cruise Robotaxi service. As ambitious as that bet was, only time will tell if GM got anything out of it besides more than $10 billion in losses.
That's the game these days. For an industry as entrenched as this one, nothing in this new future is promised and promises mean nothing.
But GM, under Barra especially, seems to have a collective talent for getting up and hitting back twice as hard when it’s knocked down. If it can keep that spirit up, we expect many more breakthroughs to come.

Battery Prices Down So Sharply That EVs Could Reach Gas Car Prices By 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/744038/ev-battery-prices-fall-faster-than-expected/,Lithium-ion battery prices witnessed a rapid fall in 2024. But something might stop this cascade.,2024-12-11 09:13:27,"“I don’t like electronic cars,” said a middle-aged woman sitting next to me on a recent flight out of New York. “They’re more expensive and don’t go too far,” she added before casually revealing that both her sons in Texas drive Teslas.
I just nodded. But this was one of the several dozen conversations I’ve had with strangers who shared their feelings about EVs. Educating the masses will be a massive undertaking for everyone involved in this transition. And while I didn’t engage with her, I’m hoping she’s reading InsideEVs this morning because lithium prices are falling faster than expected, as per a new report, speeding up the timeline for EVs to reach price parity with gas cars.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping the future of road transport. We’re also discussing loyalty among EV owners and the upcoming Stellantis-CATL battery plant in Spain.
EV battery prices are inextricably linked to costs of raw materials like lithium, a key ingredient in a cell, along with nickel, cobalt, graphite, manganese and more. While several studies have previously forecast battery prices to plummet over time, a new report from research firm BloombergNEF states that prices might be falling faster than expected, accelerating the industry’s quest for EVs to cost as much as gas cars on average by 2026.
This year, especially, was huge for the battery industry, with prices dropping 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour. Factors like lower component prices, cell overproduction and burgeoning chemistries like lithium-iron-phosphate drove the price drop this year, as per the report.
Here’s more from BloombergNEF:
The faster-than-expected decline signals that prices for electric vehicles could fall to similar levels to internal combustion engine vehicles as soon as in 2026, when average pricing is expected to fall below $100/kWh, the benchmark often referenced as the point of price parity.
“China alone is expected to produce enough battery cells to meet 92% of total global demand of 1.2 terawatt-hours for EV and stationary storage segments in 2024,” the report said. “This exerted downward pressure on battery prices. Smaller manufacturers are being challenged by their larger peers, pressured to lower cell prices and cut margins for market share.”Whether this downward trend continues over the next few years remains an open question.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (Section 45X) has massively subsidized battery costs. But its future now hangs in the balance. It’s uncertain if President-elect Donald Trump will also repeal 45X alongside the consumer tax credit (30D) of up to $7,500.
I’m inclined to think Trump won’t dismantle the entirety of the IRA. The law’s hundreds of billions in incentives have created thousands of well-paying American jobs and made North America the fastest-growing battery manufacturing region in the world.
Curtailing this ""white gold"" rush would be like giving away a lucrative inheritance just to appease a few friends and donors in oil and gas. It wouldn’t just stunt the auto industry’s growth, but also give China an even greater lead despite being so close to achieving price parity with polluting gas cars.
According to a study by the Global EV Alliance (GEVA), an auto industry non-profit, the vast majority of car buyers who go electric aren't looking back.
Of the respondents surveyed, 92% said they would repurchase fully electric models, 4% said they would opt for plug-in hybrids and about 1% said they would return to gas cars. Nearly all of them said they were satisfied being EV drivers, thanks largely to two leading factors: lower operating costs and climate concerns.
“This is a remarkably high number and the results conﬁrm that drivers love the EV experience and EVs are here to stay,” said Joel Levin, chair of GEVA and Director of Plug In America. Lower operating costs topped climate concerns as the leading reason to buy EVs, which signals that buyers have started appreciating the practicality and logic of EVs.
Even though 72% of the respondents had home charging access, they also cited public charger reliability, uptime and long charging times as the key disadvantages.
We’ve seen plenty of EV loyalty studies in the past. A recent McKinsey study said that 46% of U.S. and 29% of global EV buyers returned to gas cars. Another J.D. Power study also had similar results. A separate S&P Mobility study said that nearly 68% of Tesla buyers returned to the brand.
The GEVA survey had 23,254 respondents from 18 countries including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Norway, and India, leaving China out.
Cross-Atlantic conglomerate Stellantis, which has 14 brands under its umbrella including Jeep, Ram and Dodge, has teamed up with Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd to invest up to $4.3 billion for a lithium-ion battery plant in Zaragoza, Spain.
Stellantis is in crisis mode. Its sales are dropping and profits are shrinking due to increased competition from Chinese automakers in Europe, a challenging landscape for electrification altogether. Unions and dealer groups have also accused it of not keeping pace with the industry and recently its controversial CEO Carlos Tavares resigned ahead of schedule.
Now the automaker is turning to the world’s largest battery maker to catch up.
The 50-50 joint venture with CATL will focus on manufacturing lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. The JV is targeting the start of production by the end of 2026 and will supply packs for affordable crossovers and SUVs with an “intermediate range.”
However, reaching its maximum capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours comes with a big asterisk. Scaling up would depend on support from the Spanish government and the European Union, Stellantis said.
EV loyalty surveys are all over the place. No shocker there since adoption varies so much by region. But we want to hear from you: If you’ve gone electric, are you in for life? Or would you consider switching back to gas or hybrid? Drop your thoughts in the comments. We do read them quite seriously.

"Lightship’s Self-Propelled Electric RV Trailer Is Going Into Production, And It Ain’t Cheap",https://insideevs.com/news/743731/lightship-ae1-cosmos-production-official/,"Originally known as the Lightship L1, the trailer has its own powertrain and battery to preserve the tow vehicle’s range.",2024-12-11 09:00:00,"Towing big trailers is still the Achilles' heel of modern electric vehicles. Even though battery-powered trucks like the Rivian R1T, Chevrolet Silverado EV and Tesla Cybertruck can happily tow 10,000 pounds or more, their driving range goes down the drain the moment you attach anything on that trailer hitch.
For work, this might not be a huge annoyance, but if you’re the kind of person who loves to tow an RV across the country, you’re in for the charging experience of a lifetime. As in, you’ll have to stop every 150 miles or so to replenish the truck’s battery for the next leg of the journey.
Luckily, there’s a potential solution for that, in the form of a self-propelled RV–but it’ll cost you. One such RV is the Lightship AE.1, an American-made camper trailer that’s finally entering production next year after being unveiled in 2023. You might recall it after its initial name, the Lightship L1, but for some reason, the company decided to change it to AE.1.
More Electric Camping Trailers And RVs
Whatever the name, you should know that the luxury RV has its own electric powertrain and an embedded battery that can store up to 77 kilowatt-hours of energy. This combo means the tow vehicle–electric or otherwise–won’t have to put so much effort into pulling the trailer because the electric motor of the RV will assist with the movement, thus increasing the efficiency of the vehicle at the front.
Furthermore, the Lightship AE.1 was designed to be as aerodynamic as possible, which helps on long trips at highway speeds. When on the road, the trailer is about the same height as a Ford F-150 Lightning, but when you get to the campsite, the roof rises to expand the interior and allow campers to stand and sit comfortably.
Speaking of comfort, the first 50 units to roll off the assembly line are called AE.1 Cosmos. The limited-edition model has a full-solar roof, can sleep four adults and offers amenities like an automotive-grade HVAC system, a fully outfitted bathroom and a Galley Kitchen equipped with a dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, convection oven and induction cooktop.
“With the limited-edition Lightship AE.1 Cosmos, we’re delivering a dream travel experience for sustainable travelers, tech lovers and EV enthusiasts,” said Ben Parker, Lightship Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. “Our mission is to bring RVs into the electric age with the AE.1. The Cosmos Edition is the first premium realization, and we have other trims to fit travelers’ needs coming quickly down the road.”
The limited-edition Lightship AE.1 Cosmos retails for $250,000, and the first deliveries are slated for the summer of next year. Three additional–and more affordable–versions called the Atmos, Panos and Terros will follow.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Toyota bZ3X EV SUV Starts Under $14,000–But You Can’t Have One",https://insideevs.com/news/744039/toyota-bz3x-ev-suv-price/,"Roughly the same size as a Toyota Rav4, the electric crossover is powered by an LFP battery and has some bold range claims.",2024-12-11 08:17:52,"Toyota has just one all-electric car on sale in the United States, the bZ4X crossover. It starts at $44,465, it has 252 miles of range on a full battery and it’s not particularly impressive in the charging speed department. In other words, it’s not exactly competitive, seeing how Tesla, Hyundai and others have electric crossovers that offer more of everything for a similar price.
But Toyota knows how to build cheaper and more appealing EVs–they’re just not available in the United States. Enter the new Toyota bZ3X, an electric crossover developed with China’s GAC specifically for the Chinese market, which is notorious for breaking traditional automakers’ hopes and dreams. In other words, the world's largest car market is ruthless, so brands need to bring their A-game.
Pre-orders for the bZ3X, which is roughly the same size as a Toyota Rav4, are now live in China, and the starting price is truly impressive: 100,000 yuan or roughly $13,800. That price tag increases up to 200,000 yuan ($27,500) as you move up the trim ladder, but that’s still $17,000 less than the entry-level bZ4X in the U.S.
We Heard You Like Cheap EVs
Granted, China is well-known for subsidizing EV production in any way it can, but those are still very impressive numbers. And things only get better once we factor in the specs. Three versions will be available: 430 Air+, 520 Pro+ and 620 Max. The entry-level trim gets a single electric motor making 150 kilowatts (201 horsepower) and a 50-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack that’s good for 267 miles (430 kilometers) on a full charge on the rather lenient CLTC procedure.
Toyota hasn’t revealed the specs for the remaining trim levels, but logic dictates that the 520+ Pro will have 323 miles (520 km) of range, while the 620 Max will offer 385 miles (620 km) of range. Recharging from 30% to 80% state of charge takes 24 minutes, as per GAC-Toyota.
The EV comes with an Nvidia-powered advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that gets info from 27 sensors, including 11 high-definition cameras, 12 ultrasonic radars, 3 millimeter-wave radars and a lidar. These enable features like speed limit assist, traffic light assist, remote parking and blind spot monitoring, according to CarNewsChina.
Inside, the bZ3X has a two-spoke steering wheel, ambient lighting and an 11-speaker Yamaha audio system. An 8.8-inch screen sits in front of the steering wheel and acts as the digital instrument cluster, while a 14.6-inch floating touchscreen serves the infotainment.
Chinese buyers can pre-order the Toyota bZ3X for the equivalent of $275. This gets them priority delivery when shipments begin in March next year.",Iulian Dnistran
Costco Is Adding More EV Fast Chargers At Its Stores,https://insideevs.com/news/743982/costco-adding-more-ev-fast-chargers/,The wholesale giant partnered with Electrify America to install DC chargers capable of up to 350 kW in three states.,2024-12-11 03:48:42,"Costco, America’s largest wholesaler and the third-largest retailer in the world, is ramping up its efforts to install fast chargers for electric vehicles at its stores in the United States. The retail giant has partnered with Electrify America to open five ultra-fast EV charging stations in three states.
The move comes after a cautious entry into the DC fast-charging world earlier this year for Costco, a company that’s widely known for its gas discounts. The retailer said last year that it has no plans to add EV chargers at its stores, but then stated in its 2023 climate action plan that it wants to install fast chargers at 20 undisclosed locations during an undisclosed period.
The five stations are co-branded by Costco and Electrify America. They offer between 6 and 14 stalls, and all are capable of delivering up to 350 kilowatts of power.
More Stuff Like This
The stations are integrated into Electrify America’s network, so customers can use the operator’s smartphone app to find stalls and pay for charging sessions, but the pricing is set by Costco, which also owns the stations.
The largest station from this collaboration has 14 DC fast chargers and is located at 4107 Sierra College Boulevard in Loomis, California. Two stations with 10 stalls are up and running in Pleasanton and Sacramento in California. Two other stations, with six stalls each, are operational in Clermont, Florida, and Denver, Colorado. The latter was quietly inaugurated last year.
Costco's new DC fast chargers are co-branded by Electrify America.
Besides these Electrify America stalls, Costco also partnered with Seattle-based Electric Era to install 200 kW stalls at its warehouse store in Ridgefield, Washington. The dispensers are branded Costco and have built-in batteries to keep the lights on when grid power goes out and to make the best of off-peak electricity rates.
The DC fast chargers found at Costco parking lots have CCS1 connectors, so Tesla drivers will need an adapter to use them. At the Electric Era stalls in Ridgefield, California, it costs 29 cents/kWh to charge, according to PlugShare. At the Electrify America-installed stalls, the price is 46 cents/kWh.",Iulian Dnistran
Cruise Robotaxi Service Is Dead As GM Pivots,https://insideevs.com/news/743947/gm-pulls-funding-cruise-robotaxi/,"""A Robotaxi business is not General Motors' core business,"" said CEO Mary Barra.",2024-12-10 17:28:58,"After a staggering $10 billion investment, General Motors is officially hitting the brakes on Cruise.
The automaker's once-ambitious foray into the world of robotaxis has caused the automaker more than a few headaches—both financial and legal. And at a time when GM is more mindful of costs than ever, Cruise will be one of the first branches CEO Mary Barra lops off to save the tree.
""The amount of money to deploy a robotaxi business and then to maintain that business and grow it, it's quite a bit of capital,"" said CEO Mary Barra during a media call on Tuesday. ""A robotaxi business is not General Motors' core business.""
Instead, Barra said, GM's automated driving efforts will focus on the consumer side of things, meaning increasingly automated and driverless cars instead of a robotaxi service.
David Richardson, GM's Senior Vice President of Software and Services, acknowledged that pursuing one path to autonomy is ""way more efficient"" and that augmenting Super Cruise with the technologies developed by Cruise will drive more returns than operating a robotaxi network.
Cruise's plans to roll out robotaxis nationwide might be over, but its technology and talent won't go to waste. GM says that it plans to roll Cruise's advances into what it's calling ""Personal Autonomy""—the kind that you or I have access to in our personal vehicles. Think of a more advanced version of GM's Super Cruise with the final technical destination being Level 3 and Level 4 autonomy.
Sure, that's not the same thing as hopping in the back seat of a Cruise-branded Chevy Bolt and being chauffeured completely autonomously, but GM says that's not what folks want all of the time, anyway: they want to drive themselves.
""We know people everywhere love to drive their own vehicles, but not in every situation,"" Barra said. She later continued: ""The opportunity to deliver these benefits to our customers that they'll use every day is very exciting for us, and that is our core business,"" said Barra.
GM openly cited increased competition as a hurdle in the robotaxi market. And while GM is right—there are a lot of players on the court, like Waymo, Zoox, and allegedly, Tesla soon—Cruise was one of the big ones, recent problems aside.
Cruise Origin in SF's Castro District
But those problems did not help Cruise's chances in the marketplace. The service shut down in October 2023 after a series of collisions with pedestrians, which led to the California DMV's suspension of its autonomous taxi operations. Its founding CEO Kyle Vogt resigned soon afterward (and later directed a good deal of ire at GM for how it handles new technology) and the future of the Cruise Origin shuttle was left more in doubt than ever. While Cruise resumed operations with a small fleet of human-driven vehicles in a few cities, it never quite recovered from these setbacks. And then GM, facing a $5 billion loss from restructuring its China operations, decided to save money by pulling the plug entirely.
It’s a hard truth to swallow: the race to autonomy is expensive. It’s also proving to be harder than the brand expected For GM to abandon Cruise now could be a sign that GM simply doesn’t see Level 5 autonomy as achievable in the near future (especially since Barra specifically referenced Levels 3 and 4 as the tech it plans to port over from Cruise), or that the brand is simply unwilling to sink even more money into its autonomous driving efforts when billions could be spent better elsewhere.
Barra says that GM and Cruise haven’t worked out the details just yet. GM does intend to purchase the remaining shares of Cruise which would enable it to roll the AV company’s tech and talent into its internal ecosystem, however, that’s still a big to be decided. The automaker plans to work with Cruise’s board to see what a transition plan could look like moving forward and expects to share more with the public later this year.
Maybe the better question to ponder is whether or not the robotaxi narrative was overhyped from the get-go. Sure, Cruise’s innovations will live on in GM’s future products—in the same sense as brands developing racing tech for Formula One and then technically stuffing it into its road cars. But this major retreat is a true taste of reality for the AV industry.
And if GM needs more financial security, maybe grounding its autonomy dreams is the right path to take.

From Tesla To Rivian: Here's What One Owner Thinks After Switching,https://insideevs.com/news/743908/tesla-to-rivian-switch-owner/,"Going from a Tesla to a Rivian, you have a lot of new stuff to play with, but there are some features you may still miss.",2024-12-10 14:00:04,"Tesla makes excellent electric vehicles that many owners are so enamored with that switching to a different brand seems inconceivable. But this former Model S owner who bought a brand new 2025 Rivian R1S couldn’t be happier with the switch, although there are some Tesla features that he still misses.
Shane Burgman owned his Model S with a yoke for almost four years, and he wanted to replace it with something more practical. The logical step would have been to get a Model X, which is essentially a taller and roomier version of the Model S, but other electric vehicles might fit the bill better.
Readapting to a traditional round steering wheel with physical buttons and stalks behind the wheel shouldn’t be a problem. Still, Shane mentions that he misses the obstruction-free view of the instrument cluster that the yoke provided. However, the tried and true layout will likely grow on him after using it for a while, and it may change how he sees the Tesla yoke with its multitude of touch-sensitive buttons and no indicator or transmission stalks (which are available aftermarket).
Other features he misses from his Tesla include its excellent video streaming capabilities (with in-built YouTube, Netflix and other platforms). This isn’t a feature that is yet available in the Rivian.
Another thing he isn't happy with is the doors, which feel heavy and solid, but he says are harder than you think to close, and they could have used a soft-close feature given the price point of the R1S. The audio quality is another point of criticism, even though the R1S in the video features the upgraded audio system.
Teslas are known to have pretty good standard sound systems and the one in the Rivian is known to be somewhat mediocre, so the difference in sound quality is likely there. However, the thing Shane says he will miss most is Autopilot, which worked on virtually all roads and took some of the strain out of driving. In the Rivian, he can’t enable adaptive cruise control with lane centering on the same roads where he had it on in the Tesla.

Tesla Model 3: The Used Buyer's Guide,https://insideevs.com/news/743728/used-tesla-model-3-buying-guide/,There are a lot of used Model 3s out there. Here's what you need to know before buying one.,2024-12-10 13:00:04,"Time flies in a rapidly evolving automotive landscape. Tesla has gone from a quirky upstart to an established manufacturer. Its entry-level car, the Model 3 sedan has been in production for more than seven years. That means there are a lot of used Model 3s out there.
Used Model 3s, not so long ago, were prohibitively expensive. However, Tesla’s new car production has risen to meet demand. Thousands of used Model 3s have been hitting the market coming off lease and Hertz fleet sales. The prices of used Model 3s are plummeting. And with Tesla’s industry-leading tech and potential used EV tax credits available, a used Model 3 could be one of the best deals on the EV market.
If you are considering buying a used Tesla Model 3, here are some important questions to consider.
Tesla Model 3 (Highland)
Buying a used Model 3 suddenly became a lot more affordable. According to iSeeCars data, the average used Tesla price has fallen to $29,045, a 22.6% year-over-year drop. Anecdotally, Tesla’s Model 3s coming off leases range between $25,000-$30,000. Hertz ex-rental Tesla Model 3s range between $20,000 and $25,000; some high-mileage ones may dip below $20,000.
One major price escalator is Full Self-Driving. An FSD-equipped used Model 3 will likely be in the $30,000s. Low mileage examples may exceed $40,000.
Tesla Model 3
Most manufacturers maintain a static trim lineup. Tesla changes and reuses terminology on a whim and does not adhere to the model year cycle other brands use. It can be confusing to tell which Model 3 trim you are buying. And that could be the difference between a Model 3 with 220 miles range or one with 360 miles and 5.8-second 0 to 60 mph acceleration vs. sub-3.0-second.
Broadly, Tesla typically has offered small-battery, RWD base Model 3, RWD and AWD versions of large-battery, long-range Model 3, and AWD performance models. Double-checking the VIN is always a good idea, especially if you buy a used Model 3 from a third party. You want to ensure the used Model 3 has all the advertised features.
Tesla VIN Decoder, Plus More Model 3 Info
Tesla made some key changes to the Model 3 over its lifespan. For instance, Tesla facelifted the Model 3 in October 2020. Vehicles built afterward can include a heat pump for more efficient climate control and better range performance in cold weather. Autopilot comes standard on Model 3s built after April 2019.
2024 Tesla Model 3 (Highland)
The Model 3 Highland update made significant tweaks, including updated FSD hardware and eliminating steering column stalks for turning and shifting gears. However, that won’t be relevant to vehicles built before 2024.
Tesla Model 3 interior
Both terms create confusion. A Tesla Model 3 must be monitored at all times and cannot drive itself. Autopilot is Tesla’s basic system. It includes lane centering and adaptive cruise control. Full Self-Driving is an expensive option that costs several thousand dollars, including advanced features like Navigation on Autopilot and the latest beta features Tesla believes will develop into autonomous driving.
Tesla Model 3s built after April 2019 came standard with Autopilot. These vehicles use Tesla’s HW3 hardware, which is ready for FSD. Some used Model 3s already have it equipped. Others can add it for a $99/month subscription plan. Model 3s running previous hardware should be eligible for a complimentary upgrade to HW3 with an FSD purchase. Highland Model 3s have upgraded HW4 hardware. Buyers can check the vehicle’s hardware configuration in a touchscreen menu.
Tesla Model 3 Long Range
EVs theoretically should have fewer weak points than combustion cars with fewer moving parts. But the Tesla Model 3 has had several issues reported with the front suspension and faulty steering and suspension components. The Model 3 also suffered several reported build quality issues early in its production. Keep an eye out for issues like misaligned panels, panel gaps and paint flaws.
Many of the glitches with Tesla Model 3s have been software-related. So, in addition to regular maintenance and recalls, ensure that the used Model 3 has all of its software updates and that its infotainment screen is operational.
Tesla Model 3 Performance 2024
Short answer: yes. All EV batteries degrade. The question is whether it is meaningful. A Tesla Model 3 probably won’t be able to match its precise EPA range estimate when new. Tesla estimates an average of 12 percent degradation for its batteries over 200,000 miles. Newer chemistries may outperform that.
There are methods to assess Model 3 battery degradation yourself. Model 3s from Hertz have a Recurrent range score detailing battery health and estimated range.
Tesla replaces batteries under warranty that have hit 70 percent capacity. A Model 3 with a battery in the 90s is ideal. A vehicle in the 80s should still have some serviceable life left. The battery dipping into the 70s is when there should be a concern. Most Model 3s should not be approaching that threshold yet.
Tesla Model 3 Long Range
Yes. Tesla Model 3s come with a basic four-year or 50,000-mile warranty. That warranty is transferred to the new owner. Moreover, if you buy a used Model 3 from Tesla, the brand either adds an extra year or 10,000 miles to the existing warranty or provides a new one-year or 10,000-mile warranty. Most Model 3s also have an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty on the battery and powertrain components.

Watch The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Take On The Kia EV6 GT In A Range Test,https://insideevs.com/news/743901/kia-ev6-hyundai-ioniq5-highway/,"The two vehicles are built on the same underpinnings, but their battery packs have different capacities.",2024-12-10 12:00:08,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is the newest high-performance EV from Hyundai-Kia. It has a larger battery pack and more power than the mechanically related Kia EV6 GT, and this is reflected in their EPA range ratings. However, their real-world range results are closer than the official estimates suggest, as demonstrated in this 70 mph highway range test comparison.
Out Of Spec Reviews posted this nearly one-hour-long range test video in which they drove the two cars until they were completely out of juice and stopped moving. Both cars have dual-motor configurations, but the newer Ioniq 5 N has a bigger 84-kilowatt-hour battery pack, while the EV6 GT has to make do with 77 kWh.
Kia has recently updated the EV6, equipping it with the same 84 kWh battery as the Ioniq 5. However, the EV6 GT in the video is the pre-refresh model, so it has the smaller battery, giving it a claimed EPA range of 206 miles. The larger-battery Ioniq 5 N is rated at 221 miles.
The result of the range test was surprising, though. The EV6 GT entered low-power mode after 214 miles and could no longer maintain 70 mph, and it was completely out of power after passing the 216-mile mark. The Ioniq 5 N could not maintain 70 mph after just under 212 miles, and it died shortly after, so even though it had a larger and newer battery, it lost to the older EV6.
The Kia was also more efficient, with a displayed average electricity consumption of 2.9 miles/kWh versus 2.7 miles/kWh in the Hyundai. This might come down to aerodynamics (the EV6 has a drag coefficient of 0.28 versus 0.29 in the Hyundai) or the rolling resistance of the different tires they were on.
The takeaway is that both vehicles can achieve (or come close to achieving) their EPA claim while driving constantly at 70 mph. As Kyle suggests in the video, the Ioniq 5 N they used in the video may have been used hard before they got the car, and this could have caused accelerated battery degradation and capacity loss.
With a battery that’s 8.5% larger than before, the updated Kia EV6 GT could get an EPA range rating of over 230 miles or close to 340 miles in the long-range rear-wheel-drive model with 19-inch wheels. The GT variant will also gain the Ioniq 5 N’s 641 hp motors and its simulated shifting, which isn’t as bad as you think.

You Can Now Buy An Electric Hyundai On Amazon,https://insideevs.com/news/743902/hyundai-amazon-autos-live/,"Want a Hyundai EV, but don't want to endure Hyundai dealer shenanigans? Amazon Autos is the platform for you. Here's how it works.",2024-12-10 11:28:31,"It's hardly a secret that in 2024, Hyundai makes some of the best electric vehicles you can buy. The problem is that buying one means engaging with Hyundai's notorious network of American car dealers. So, if you'd rather take your chances on Amazon instead and you live in one of the 48 cities involved with the pilot, the newly launched Amazon Autos platform is for you.
Put more simply, the dream is finally real: the ability to pick out the car you want and arrange the financing, e-sign paperwork and delivery options completely online, without having to go to a physical dealership until it's time to take your new car home. It's a buying experience that fans of startup automakers like Tesla and Rivian have enjoyed for years, but now it's coming to a traditional car company as well.
Amazon Autos went live today and works with participating dealers in 48 cities, including New York, Austin, Miami, Dallas, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and more. (See a full list in this news release.) For now, the selections are limited to Hyundai's cars, as it was announced as the inaugural launch partner more than a year ago. However, that includes a wide range of electric, hybrid, and gas cars from the Korean automaker. Moreover, more options are coming.
""We continue to add more Hyundai dealerships, and next year, we will roll out additional manufacturers, brands, cities, and new functionality,"" Amazon officials said in a statement. ""With Amazon Autos, customers have a simple, end-to-end online experience to purchase their next vehicle.""
Just like buying anything else on Amazon, the process does seem rather simple and seamless.
Hyundai Amazon
When you click ""shop available cars,"" you're given a list of available Hyundai models near you—complete with photos—just as you'd see on Cars.com,  AutoTrader or another marketplace. But those platforms are for browsing; this is for buying. After searching for the car you want and filtering by various colors, features, and options, you click ""begin purchase,"" and you're taken to a window where you're asked to arrange financing or pay in full. (Leasing, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be an option for now, which means many of the great deals we've seen on Hyundai EVs have to be secured at the dealer.)
After that, you can figure out your trade-in value, set your down payment and monthly payments, apply for credit online if you need to, upload your documents, sign the contracts and then arrange a pickup from your local Hyundai dealer. In theory, this can be done in under half an hour, as opposed to the lengthy, hours-long process that usually entails buying from a dealer.
Hyundai Amazon
Another benefit of doing things this way is pricing transparency. ""The price customers see at check-out is the price they pay, inclusive of all taxes and fees,"" Amazon officials said. When you pick up the car, your dealer hopefully starts building a relationship with you to make sure you're happy and have any questions and service needs covered.
That's an area where Hyundai has often struggled in modern times. While the Korean automaker has transformed from a budget brand to one that's a world-class competitor to the likes of Toyota, Volkswagen and Tesla, it's often dogged by the reputation of its U.S. dealer network. Just recently, one InsideEVs staff member who sought to acquire an Ioniq 5 was repeatedly lured to various Hyundai dealers on the promise of super-low lease deals, only to get radically different quotes when he actually came in. So while Hyundai executives can't say this directly, and have not, this could be behind the company's motivations here.
For now, it's probably a good workaround. Hyundai cannot go full-bore into completely online sales in the U.S. because it's bound by franchise agreements with its existing dealer network, and legal wrangling between the dealers and the automaker reportedly held up the platform's launch. (See also how Volkswagen's dealers are throwing a fit after the new Scout Motors brand announced a plan to sell directly like Tesla does.) Dealers have also held up direct sales for many startup automakers in several states.
Still, it's increasingly odd that a new car is one of the few things you can't buy online in 2024. Amazon's efforts here could go a long way toward remedying that, especially as more car companies get added to the mix.

Jaguar's Rebrand Has An Even Tougher Foe: An EV War With China,https://insideevs.com/news/743787/jaguar-strategy-china-evs-glover/,"“If we make this a technical or price competition [against China], I’m not sure we can play to win."" Instead, ""sophistication in design"" is the answer.",2024-12-10 11:18:07,"Much has already been said about the relaunch of the Jaguar brand, most of it in the form of the vacuously cruel homophobic pablum that occupies much of the internet’s twiddling. A sliver of it has contained intelligent analysis. But little of it has looked at how the venerable, reimagined brand plans to address the world’s largest car market and the most cutthroat place on Earth to sell electric vehicles: China.
After all, China’s newcomer brands are rapidly displacing American, European and other Asian ones there as their EV technology quickly surpasses that of the rest of the world. At the same time, those Chinese automakers are the source of endless headaches for Volkswagen, Stellantis and others on their home turf. So as flashy and controversial as the leaping cat’s rebrand has been, it’s an open question how Jaguar 2.0 hopes to compete in China—and with China.
To remedy that, I sat down with Jag’s managing director, Rawdon Glover, in Miami, surrounded by the giant pastel pink walls and horizontal overhead streamers under which the brand’s Type 00 concept had been revealed, the mere hue of which cued shiftless gendered panic in so many keyboarding warriors.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Turns out, Jaguar has ideas about China. “As part of our strategy, we will be present in fewer markets, but we will want to really concentrate our efforts in those markets that are going to be super important for us,” Glover said. “And China, you can't ignore the largest automotive market in the world, the largest luxury market in the world. And so that's going to be going to be key for us as well.”
However, Glover admits that the British sport/luxury marque, unlike its Land Rover siblings, does not have a strong identity in that market—nor has it seen anything resembling strong sales there in about a decade.
“If I look at Range Rover, for example, it really resonates in China, and it’s very, very strong,” he said. “We've got some work to do with the Jaguar brand, which is really part of why we’re starting so early, because we probably won't be in China until 2027.”
Rawdon Glover
For more than a decade, the Chinese market has held intense sway in global automotive design, influencing everything from grille size to chrome adornment to interior materiality and ambiance. According to Glover, the response in China seems to favor the marque’s new design and identity, which may have some significant correlation with the rebrand’s very intentional audacity.
“The initial reaction I'm hearing from China has been really positive in terms of the direction,” he said. “It's very bold, is very evocative. And that plays well in that market, particularly among a lot of the young Chinese wealth. So, in terms of the repositioning, if we can connect into that in the right way, then I think we'll be on to something.”
Jaguar Commercial Screenshot
Glover went on to describe some of the psychographic features that define this sought-after demographic category of young Chinese wealth. “We think people will be attracted to this who are independent-minded. They're interested in design. Clearly, there is a level of economics involved, but there are also people that want to make a bolder choice,” he said. “Somebody who wants to make a very conservative luxury choice, that's fine. We’re not going to be the brand for them. Jaguar is going to be a brand for people who make a really clear choice that they want to stand out from the crowd.”
In the two or three years between now and Jaguar’s first product deliveries in China, it has plenty of work to do, not just in terms of branding, but in terms of connecting with potential consumers. This provides further opportunity for reinvention, though nothing seems to be firmly set just yet. “We need to examine every single aspect of our customer journey if we're going to elevate the brand to the price point we’re projecting,” Glover said. “So, yeah, that's definitely on my to-do list.”
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
That price, in the U.S., will, according to Glover, begin at “about $120,000” for the four-door GT that Jag will release first in 2026, though cost will scale up significantly from there, given the pricey opportunities for personalization and individualization, opportunities that will be very important to the brand’s bottom line, as such optioning can add 50% or more to the sticker, and yield profits of as much as 80% for the automakers.
Glover expects that this elevated luxury positioning—along with outré design, and the intrinsic history and resonance of Jaguar—will also help insulate it from the onslaught of more affordable, Chinese-made electric vehicles that are flooding European, and other, markets.
“If we try and make this a technical or price competition [against China], I’m not sure that's a game we can necessarily play to win,” he said. “I also think that while there's lots of very, very competent vehicles coming out of China, I don't think they have the sophistication in design that that we have. Maybe that will evolve, but those are the two differentiators.”
2025 Nio ET9
Still, it is evident that, while the Chinese automakers have focused for now on the more mainstream EV market, it is inevitable that they will continue to elevate their offerings. So I asked Glover if he sees those manufacturers eventually turning their sights upmarket.
“I think I see them moving into the premium segment, or endeavoring to,” he said, citing the Nio ET9 sedan, which will be priced around £90,000 ($114,000). “How successful will that be? That's quite an elevated price point. We'll see how that does,” he says.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
He very intentionally positioned the new Jaguar brand in a category above premium. “I think luxury is another level,” he said. He offered a parallel in luxury consumer goods. “I’ve spent quite a bit of time in China. China is the single largest market for luxury brands outside of auto as well. And if you go to the luxury malls, it's the established global brands—Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton—that dominate. Because they've got history, they've got provenance. And that's what you're buying into. You don't see a whole rash of ultra-high-end Chinese brands appearing,” he said. “Now, maybe in time that's going to change. I suspect we're going to see something similar in the automotive space, certainly in the medium term. And by that, I mean 10-15 years. That's my take.”
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Recent history has proven that the Chinese market can shift and adapt rapidly. And Jaguar is on a cautious, years-long path in reintroducing itself there. Who knows where that market, or any of us, will be in 2027 and beyond. As a fan of the brand and its spirit, I hope Jaguar will make it. And that clearly means making it in China.

"NYC Wants To Make You License And Insure Your E-Bike, Sounds Like A Cash Grab",https://www.rideapart.com/news/743521/nyc-e-bike-license-and-insurance/,Do you think the City Council just wants a piece of the action?,2024-12-25 01:25:33,"If you rely on an e-bike in any way—you ride one, your business employs people who ride them, your takeaways are delivered atop an e-bike—you might be about to get screwed by the NYC Council. The NYC Council has proposed a bill that would require license plates and registration in the city for e-bikes and other electric micromobility vehicles. Although the bill hasn't passed the City Council yet, it very well might, as 30 lawmakers now back the bill. There'll be a hearing to advance the measure next week.
It's unknown how the process of registering the e-bikes with the DMV would go or how much it will cost, but there will certainly be a registration fee. But the financial burden of the new fee is likely to cost restauranteurs more than anyone else.
“Obviously, adding a registration fee is the city posing yet another financial burden on small businesses and workers,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, before adding, “The city already has a long list of requirements for restaurants that directly employ cyclists,” added Rigie. “We don’t need to double up and make things more confusing.”
The reasoning behind the bill is safety or, more specifically, a way to monitor unsafe riding and fine riders for bad behavior.
The bill was introduced by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, who had this to say, “All you have to do is walk down any street in New York City, and especially in Manhattan, to see the problem... I dare say almost every New Yorker has been hit or had a close call. This bill is not going to solve everything, but it will start to address some of it.” But, is this just another cash grab from another city council?
I can't comment on e-bike usage specifically in NYC, but I can tell you what I see in general. I see an economy where people can't afford to buy, run, or maintain cars and e-bikes as a viable economic alternative. Moreover, some businesses are thriving thanks to e-bikes, and there are more jobs as a result. In terms of urban economies, e-bikes have been working wonders for the last few years, making them the perfect target to be slapped with a ""registration fee"".
If you live in NYC and want to submit written testimony against the bill, you can do so here. You can also testify virtually or go in person at the hearing on December 11, 2024.
Let us know in the comments if you think this bill should pass or if it's simply another cash grab.

BYD Could Soon Outsell Ford And Honda,https://insideevs.com/news/743879/byd-outsell-ford-honda-2024/,"The Chinese giant was an unknown entity just a few years ago. Now, it's on course to topple two of the biggest names in the industry.",2024-12-10 10:00:00,"Everybody knows about BYD even if it doesn’t sell passenger cars in the United States. That’s because it’s one of the world’s largest automakers and at one point it was the largest all-electric car maker, toppling Tesla for a few short and sweet months.
But BYD is only getting started. After making a name for itself in China’s domestic car market as the leading builder of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), the company is coming after some of the biggest names in the industry: Ford and Honda, both widely recognized brands with rich histories behind them.
BYD Atto 3
But history can’t influence global buyers’ decisions, it seems, as BYD is on course to surpass Ford and Honda by the end of this year—if everything goes according to plan.
More On Chinese EV Makers
Last month, the Chinese automaker sold a whopping 506,804 vehicles around the world, according to data filed with Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday quoted by Fortune. But that’s not all—year-to-date, BYD has sold 3.7 million cars, a 40% increase from last year.
If the automaker manages to keep the impressive sales momentum through the end of December, it will most likely surpass its goal of selling four million cars globally. In the meantime, it could also pass Ford and Honda, marking a major shift in the way consumers around the world make their car-buying decisions.
In the first nine months, Ford sold 3.3 million cars globally, while Honda sold 3.1 million cars. If the two companies’ pace continues until the end of the year, we could see Ford closing 2024 with 4.3 million sales and Honda with 4 million units sold. If BYD ramps up sales by 100,000 units in December, its final tally for this year would be around 4.3 million units.
Next year, BYD aims to sell between 5 and 6 million cars, according to a Citi note published after a meeting with the automaker's management.
The Dolphin (left) and Seal (right), two of BYD's most successful models.
We’ll know for sure what the scoreboard will look like sometime in January, but whatever the results, one thing is clear: BYD is here to win. Even without a presence in the passenger vehicle market in the United States, its popularity skyrocketed in just a few short years, boosted by so-called traditional automakers’ inability to adapt to the intricacies of the Chinese car market.
BYD still has some work to do to topple the world’s top players, but if its previous performance is anything to go by, it won’t be long before we see its name at the top of the global automaker list. Volkswagen, for instance, sold 6.5 million vehicles in the first nine months of the year, while Toyota sold 8.3 million vehicles in the first 10 months. Tesla, meanwhile, delivered 1.3 million all-electric cars in the first three quarters–100,000 more than BYD. That said, BYD’s portfolio includes EVs and plug-in hybrids, which is why its overall sales figures are higher than Tesla’s.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla's 2025 Will Be 'A Year Of Product Launches',https://insideevs.com/news/743791/tesla-2025-year-product-launches/,"Plus, the Robotaxi launch is going to be a wild learning curve and Jaguar is increasing the price of its new EV.",2024-12-10 09:30:00,"The electric vehicle market is headed for a lot of uncertainty next year, but it's also growing ever more competitive. For brands just getting into the EV space, the sky's the limit and consumers are here for it. But for other automakers that have been around a while—looking at you, Tesla—putting some makeup on a seven-year-old car isn't exactly the recipe for success in the long run. And that's why Tesla is reportedly preparing some big product launches for 2025.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Tesla's robotaxi launch, the gas tax, and Jaguar's upcoming EV costing a small fortune. Let's jump in.
Tesla has officially hyped 2025 as a year of product launches—something which should excite investors (as long as they ignore the possibility of Tesla spending some serious cash) and seasoned Tesla-watchers digging for aspirin. And that all starts with multiple new vehicles reportedly planned for launch in 2025.
News of the product launches comes from a Deutsche Bank investor note shared with InsideEVs late Monday. The takeaways from DB outline the firm's talks with Travis Axelrod, Tesla's Head of Investor Relations, at Deutsche Bank's Autonomous Driving Day, including the launch of a mysterious new vehicle dubbed ""Model Q"" and several other key product offerings set to happen during the second half of 2025.
Starting off with Model Q—a name which was penned by Deutsche Bank, not Tesla, by the way—the automaker is planning an EV with a starting price of under $30,000. Just to be clear, that price includes U.S. federal tax incentives, meaning that if those are wiped from the face of the earth during the Trump administration, the vehicle will likely start around $37,499 instead.
The specifics of this model are currently unclear, however, the report from Deutsche Bank mentions this vehicle separately from the Robotaxi (which it calls the CyberCab in the report). Keep in mind that Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that it would be ""silly"" and ""pointless"" to have a $25,000 EV that wasn't a robotaxi, so maybe that extra $5,000 is for pedals and other things meant to put a human behind the wheel. Either way, it seems that Tesla's cheap EV might not be dead in the water as expected.
That vehicle is expected to be launched, or at least debuted, during the first half of 2025. And that's not all folks—the second half of the year will have ""other new vehicles released,"" according to the note. Yes, that's ""vehicles,"" plural.
The second half of 2025 is said to bring a three-row EV riding on a longer wheelbase than the Model Y released today. The idea is to expand Tesla's total addressable market—meaning those folks who want a three-row SUV and won't consider a Tesla since there's simply not one in its lineup today. Could this be Tesla's ""one more thing"" that could drop with the announcement of the refreshed Model Y Juniper? Maybe, however, that particular vehicle is expected to be released in the Chinese auto market and it's not clear if or when it will make its way to other markets.
Deutsche Bank doesn't note what other vehicles might release during the second half of the year, only that Tesla is expected to launch ""other new vehicles"" during that time.
One last note is that Tesla expected to launch all of these vehicles on existing production lines. That means it's possible that Tesla's semi-permanent Tent City could grow even larger as it stands up new additions to its lines in preparation to tool up for these new vehicles. It also means that Gigafactory Mexico's future is looking ever-bleaker, though a tariff-laden future under the incoming Trump administration could change that.
Keep in mind that this could all be Tesla blowing smoke. The company's track record for hitting deadlines and staying with its plans is, let's say, colorful. And as Deutsche Bank points out, if Tesla wants to grow its volume by 30% in 2025 as projected, it needs to execute its operations absolutely flawlessly—which isn't exactly something that Tesla has done in the past. Growth and success are all hinging on things moving swiftly and smoothly for Tesla. Can it do it?
Following Tesla's year of product launches will be the product that has investors really on the hook: the Tesla Robotaxi.
The Robotaxi, or CyberCab as Musk likes to call it, is Tesla's truly passive earner. Pop out a vehicle that costs between $20,000 and $30,000 to manufacture and set it loose on the world to deliver autonomous rides at the press of a button. Tesla believes that it can compete against rivals like Waymo and Cruise just by taking vehicle cost into consideration—that's not even talking about software performance versus Tesla's lack of complex sensors like Lidar in its autonomous vehicle hardware suite. But there's so much more at play here, and that's going to be the real learning curve for Tesla.
Deutsche Bank's note digs into the specifics of the Robotaxi operations and development which could prove to be roadblocks to CyberCab's rapid growth:
Tesla believes it would be reasonable to assume some type of teleoperatorwould be needed at least initially for safety/redundancy purposes.

[...]

Management intends to start off entirely with the company-owned fleet and eventually dynamically adjust supply based on customer demand/traffic patterns.
[...]
As the CyberCab rollout occurs in 2026, the company will need to make investments across its service/cleaning and charging apparatus (e.g., install wireless charging) with TX and CA likely the first states to see a rollout given proximity to manufacturing facilities and headquarters.
The analyst makes a great note regarding Tesla's current infrastructure. The CyberCab is ditching Tesla's NACS port for fully wireless charging. That should make topping off the battery a breeze versus the complex snake arm prototype that Tesla tried building almost a decade ago, however, Tesla's existing charging infrastructure isn't set up to wirelessly charge any vehicle, let alone a fleet of robotaxis. This means that Tesla also needs to update its infrastructure over the next year to overcome this challenge.
And it's not just about charging, either. Tesla's vehicles will have to be checked for cleanliness between rides and, if less than ideal, unsullied for the next rider. This could mean a team of actual people prepping vehicles like revolving doors.
Let's not forget about teleoperators either. As Tesla mentioned to Deutsche Bank, it's not unreasonable to assume that the automaker will need teleoperators to handle remote operations if something goes awry. Think of the Optimus robots at Tesla's We, Robot event, but on wheels and driving at speeds of 45 miles per hour. This isn't unheard of, though. Cruise and Waymo both have teleoperators and need them fairly frequently—but it's just one more tool that Tesla will need to add to its belt before this robotaxi thing can really get started.
Tesla does believe that it has an advantage over both of those competitors, though. As usual, the automaker critiques their so-called Lidar ""crutch""—so much so that Tesla's leadership isn't even viewing any brand as ""true competition"" in the U.S. and Europe from a cost and scale perspective. Tesla instead believes that both Cruise and Waymo are relying on these sensor suites to ""compensate for deficiencies"" in their software.
Mud-slinging won't get Tesla past the tipping point it needs to solve self-driving, though. It's got just two short years before it needs to have its Robotaxis stop slamming into curbs and driving onto sidewalks. Is that enough time to perfect its software and prepare its infrastructure for a whole new breed of cars? We're about to find out.
Jaguar is at a weird point in its life. The British marque has been frustrated with the move to EVs—which is odd considering it was one of the OG pioneers of electrification with the tightly-styled, albeit stagnant, Jaguar I-Pace. So rather than compete with the number of premium EVs out there teetering around the six-figure mark, Jag is going all-out and declaring its intention of re-branding as an ultra-luxury automaker.
That all starts with the recently unveiled Type 00 concept. I know it might look like some designers copied the ergonomics of an air conditioner, but this is Jag's attention-grabbing show of power—its ""new species"" of EV—in a market that is growing in competition. Its price? Well, Jag said that it's not rolling out of bed for anything less than $155,000 (120,000 British Pounds). Actually, scratch that. The price is going up.
Jaguar Land Rover CEO Adrian Mardell recently told Euro News that the true cost of its future EV will actually be closer to $190,000 (150,000 GBP), or around two-and-a-half times the cost of the outgoing I-Pace SUV.
The automaker expects to spend nearly $2 billion transitioning to electrification, and that plan includes taking an entire year off of selling cars in its home market. That means to break even on its massive investment, it somehow needs to sell more than 10,500 units of its ultra-luxury EV—and that's not accounting for the actual profit margin per vehicle.
In case you were wondering how much of a lift this will be, sales of Jaguar-branded cars in America hasn't exactly been great. Jag sold just 509 units of the $72,000 I-Pace in 2023, and 5,258 units of the $57,000 F-Pace (its best-selling model) in 2023.
Now, you have to remember, Jaguar is really aiming to shake up its buyers in this brand transition. It doesn't want Mercedes or BMW buyers anymore. The brand is just way too posh for the likes of them. Instead, it wants the folks who were considering Bentley or Maserati. But those aren't high-volume brands either—Bentley sold just 4,167 cars globally in 2023, and Maserati moved significantly more at around 26,600 units. Still, the point here is that Jaguar's market is quite limited and it will need to move some serious weight to make back its hefty investment. So perhaps a higher price per unit makes sense from that perspective.
The bigger question is if Jaguar can really convince buyers to divest from their current brand and buy whatever the final product of the ""unmistakable"" Type 00 really is. Sure, the concept is an eye-catcher. But so is the Tesla Cybertruck and look what kind of reception those owners are getting right now. If Jaguar doesn't get the buyers that it needs, it could spell disaster for the brand's future.
While Cruise and Waymo are seemingly looking to augment vehicle ownership in the big city, Tesla's move with the Robotaxi seems to be aimed at giving up vehicle ownership entirely. After all, if you manage to get the cost of ridership below that of owning a car, why would you own one?
I say this as someone who largely loves driving and holds the ""you can pry the keys from my cold, dead hands"" mentality toward car ownership, it would take a lot to convince me to give up my own car, even if it meant spending more to keep one in my driveway.
That being said, not everyone shares the same view. Some of you might live in a more urban area that has a better public transit system, or perhaps you rarely drive for another reason. So what would it take for you to give up vehicle ownership? Let me know in the comments.

It’s Getting Cheaper To Charge At Tesla Superchargers,https://insideevs.com/news/743824/tesla-supercharger-cheaper-prices/,EV drivers in the United States and Europe have noticed slight price reductions in the past week.,2024-12-10 04:03:25,"The Tesla Supercharger network is widely regarded as one of the best DC fast charging networks for electric vehicles in the United States. It’s a stress-free experience almost every time and there are stations almost everywhere.
However, there’s a price to pay for this. More often than not, charging at a Tesla Supercharger is more expensive than using rival charging operators like Electrify America, EVgo or ChargePoint, especially if you’re driving a non-Tesla EV.
Things are changing for the better, though, as charging prices at Tesla Superchargers across the United States and Europe have dropped slightly in the past week. The changes were noticed by @Electric_Maik on X, who posted several graphs showing the differences.
More EV Charging Stories
The price drops were confirmed by Max de Zegher, Tesla’s global Charging boss who was previously the Charging Director for North America.
“Some Supercharger price reductions overall,” de Zegher said. The goal is to lower the charging prices to accelerate EV adoption and to be financially sustainable by investing in the charging network, Tesla’s rep added.
Judging from the graphs embedded below, the price reductions aren’t exactly huge, ranging anywhere from 5 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, which amounts to a drop of around 7% depending on the location. That said, not all Superchargers are cheaper, so keep that in mind when setting off for your next road trip.
Another interesting piece of information revealed by Max de Zegher is that the Tesla Supercharger network delivered a record-setting 12 gigawatt-hours of energy to North American customers on November 30. That’s the Saturday after Thanksgiving when people were most likely traveling back home after the holiday.
We’d like to know what the pricing situation is like where you charge. Have the Supercharger prices gone down? Let us know in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran

Analysts at the firm are calling it the ""Model Q,"" though the name is in quotes and unofficial. But there are enticing new details about what this more affordable Tesla model might be, and its cost.
""The new Tesla model (we refer to as ""Model Q"") should launch in 1H25 and will be priced <$30k including subsidies (i.e., $37,499 if US EV tax credit goes away),"" the Deutsche Bank report said.
Tesla itself has not confirmed this news. But InsideEVs has seen the Deutsche Bank investor report on Tesla's plans for 2025, and the firm is claiming that the information comes directly from Travis Axelrod, Tesla's head of IR. The new model will be built on the company's existing product manufacturing lines, saving the company from the difficult and costly process of spinning up a new facility.

Tesla projected to Deutsche Bank that the new models would increase volumes by 20-30% over the next year, though profits will likely dip as the company spends big to get new models out the door.
That's right: New models. Not model. Deutsche Bank also says a long-wheelbase three-row Model Y is planned for China, too. That'll be a nice add in what's becoming a much more contested market for the EV giant.
But the so-called ""Model Q"" is a much bigger story. We don't have further details, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly hinted at a more affordable variant of the brand's existing products. Instead of an all-new platform—and all of the bug-testing, money and time that takes—he's suggested that the company can cut costs out of existing products.
New Tesla Model 3 interior
Given how stripped-down the Model 3 and Model Y already are inside, it's unclear what would be cut. The proposed Model Q could use cheaper or smaller batteries, less powerful motors or perhaps an even cheaper interior. Tesla could also cut out the ""Full Self-Driving"" hardware, but the dishonestly named software is so key to the company's current pitch as an AI company that it's hard to imagine it happening.
Either way, Deutsche Bank claims that the company plans to sell it for under $30,000 after the federal tax credit is applied. That means it'll be under $37,500, putting it right in the neighborhood of the $35,000 Chevy Equinox EV. With tax credits, the Equinox can be had for under $28,000, and it accomplishes that in part thanks to a low-power front-wheel-drive variant that's far cheaper than the AWD version.
But the Model Y and Model 3 are already sold as single-motor cars. The base Model 3 starts at $44,130 with destination before credits, while a rear-wheel-drive Model Y goes for $44,990. Cutting costs by another $7,000 will be tough, but the company does have options. The ""Standard Range"" Model 3 and Model Y no longer exist, and cutting the battery size would surely drive down costs. The Model Q could also be smaller, and offer fewer seats. Fewer parts could also decrease production costs.
After unveiling the Cybercab, Elon Musk poured cold water on the idea of an all-new, $25,000 Tesla with a steering wheel. But he left the door open for a cheaper, reworked version of an existing product.
For now, it's unclear. But for the first time, we have what is effectively official confirmation that a sub-$30,000 Tesla will be here soon. While the news isn't coming straight from Tesla, the brand's Head of IR wouldn't be telling Wall Street about a new model if it wasn't serious about bringing it to market.
I just hope Tesla can hit its deadline. But that's not usually a good bet to make.

Quad-Motor M Prototype Drive Left BMW Executives Speechless,https://insideevs.com/news/743751/bmw-m-quad-motor-video/,"BMW is experimenting with using four motors in future M cars, and they’re apparently very exciting to drive.",2024-12-09 13:00:49,"The Rimac Nevera is probably the most exciting EV to drive, but that’s not only because of its 2,000 horsepower output (it would still be ludicrously quick with half that). It all comes from using a quad-motor setup with advanced torque vectoring that can dramatically vary how the car behaves. Now imagine that same level of power and control but in a much more attainable (and possibly even four-door and wagon) body.
We’ve known for a while that BMW’s Motorsport division was looking to create quad-motor M cars, and the manufacturer has even shared some details and photos. But now this is the first time when BMW has shown the i4 M50-based quad-motor prototype, and it is quite exciting.
BMW M released a video showing the stages of testing and preparation it undertook to organize a drive event for the company’s board members. They are the ones who will ultimately decide if the company goes through with the quad-motor EV project, and they were apparently left speechless after experiencing the test mule.
There is surely a lot more that BMW isn’t showing us. The i4-based prototype is old now, and there are surely more advanced ones in testing right now. In the blurb accompanying the video, BMW notes that “at various secret test sites, the engineers are working flat out to develop the first fully electric high-performance M model.”
The manufacturer explains that “The fact that all four wheels are each driven by their own electric motor opens up completely new possibilities. Within milliseconds, the power and torque of the spontaneously reacting electric motors can be controlled with a precision that is unattainable with conventional drive systems.” This should result in more predictable and fun handling, bringing the driving experience closer to that of a combustion-powered M car.
BMW will keep selling combustion M cars in the future, but the electric models will represent the performance pinnacle with outputs as high as 1,000 horsepower. We know an electric M3 equivalent is in the works, which should debut as a production model in 2027 or 2028.
One of the very first performance EVs had a quad-motor setup, and it was a hoot to drive: the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive unveiled in 2012. Its four motors produced 750 hp combined, which allowed the car to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) from a standstill in 3.9 seconds, but they also bestowed it with great agility.
But that car was launched over 10 years ago. It was very expensive and low-volume and EVs have improved considerably since. There hasn’t been a sporty quad-motor EV since except for the Rimac Nevera and its sister car, the Pininfarina Battista, but those cost in the millions. BMW will offer attainable quad-motor EVs, likely starting a trend that could take over the sporty EV segment since it gives such a competitive edge.

Xiaomi's Tesla Model Y Fighter Looks Like A Budget Ferrari,https://insideevs.com/news/743754/xiaomi-yu7-crossover-china-ferrari/,"The Xiaomi YU7 is expected to take aim right at the Tesla Model Y, and looks like a Ferrari Purosangue.",2024-12-09 12:00:45,"It’s MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) day again in China: a day that’s definitely the bane of every tech and car producer who wants to sell in the country. The last step in Chinese market homologation is for the manufacturers themselves to submit photos and technical information to this state entity. Every few weeks or so, the Chinese government makes all this information public, whether the product or car has been officially revealed or announced. It sucks for manufacturers, but it’s a great way to see cars weeks before they’re unveiled.
Well, Xiaomi got in front of MIIT’s notoriously bad patent-style photos and released official images of its follow-up SUV mere minutes after MIIT leaked the photos. Xiaomi’s first crossover will be called YU7. It’s pretty dang slick-looking, that’s for sure.
Like the SU7 sedan, the YU7 has the same McLaren-esque front headlamps and single rear heckblende-crossed-with-Dodge’s-racetrack rear tail lamp assembly, but from there the designs diverge a lot. Xiaomi has embraced a decidedly low-slung, cab-rearward shape reminiscent of the Ferrari Purosangue. There are other details that set the cars apart, too. Whereas the SU7 has standard pull-style door handles, the YU7 trades that for hidden ones that will likely retract in and out of the car’s body.
The MIIT said the YU7 will have dual electric motors that are good for 681 horsepower, but there will be a slight bump over the dual-motor SU7 Max’s 664 horsepower. Slower, less powerful variants of the YU7 are likely to launch, but it’s not clear what the power levels of those units will be. Similarly, range, price, and battery size have also not been announced for the YU7. We do know that it will launch in June or July of 2025 and will be made in the same factory as the SU7 sedan. Some have speculated that the YU7 will follow suit as the SU7 and start directly equivalent to their Tesla competition. This means that when released, the YU7 could start at around $34,000, which is what a Tesla Model Y costs in China.
Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan has been a mega-hit inside of China. It has only been on the market since December 2023, yet Xiaomi has managed to hit its manufacturing target of 100,000 cars in a year more than a month ahead of schedule. It’s a well-reviewed car inside and outside of China, for good reason. When I got some seat time with the SU7 in Beijing this year, I found the SU7 to generally be impressive with respect to its design and perception of quality. The car is seamlessly integrated into Xiaomi’s other smart home products.
If Xiaomi’s YU7 has the same success as the SU7, and it likely will, then this is bad news for a lot of EV brands, both domestic Chinese and foreign rivals. Of course, the aging Tesla Model Y will face a huge challenge, but other brands might not have the brand recognition or value proposition that Xiaomi will undoubtedly offer on the YU7. The Chinese EV market is tough.
Other brands should batten down the hatches because there’s going to be a bloodbath next summer.

The Lucid Gravity Has Landed. Here's Why It Needs To Be A Hit,https://insideevs.com/news/743711/lucid-gravity-korea-battery-cm/,"Plus, South Korea is getting nervous about the U.S. battery boom under Trump, and Rivian's stock price is suddenly thriving.",2024-12-09 10:00:00,"I'll tell anyone who will listen that the Lucid Air is, in my humble estimation, pretty much the best electric vehicle you can buy in America today. The only problem is that it's an expensive electric luxury sedan tasked with keeping a promising startup afloat at a time when the market is moving away from all of those things. Some help is finally on the way in the form of the Lucid Gravity SUV, but it too arrives at a moment of profound uncertainty.
Can the family-friendly Gravity move the needle for Lucid Motors in 2025 and beyond? We'll look at that on today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and tech news. Also on tap today: South Korea has been cooking up a battery boom in the U.S., but now it's getting nervous about its prospects under the incoming Trump administration, and Rivian's stock price seems poised to end 2025 on a high note. Let's dig in.
2025 Lucid Gravity
Production of the Lucid Gravity officially kicked off last week at the startup's Casa Grande, Arizona factory, making good on a promise to do so before 2024 drew to a close. Lucid Motors' CEO Peter Rawlinson marked the occasion with these social media posts showing the first car driving off the assembly line:
It's hard to overstate just how much Lucid needs this car—and needs it to be a success. The California-based EV startup, now majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has done about all it probably can for now with the Air sedan and its starting-at-$70,000 price tag. Now it needs more mainstream models that can appeal to a wider audience, which will hopefully pay the bills until it can get more affordable mass-volume EVs on the road. If you think of the Lucid Air as a stand-in for the Tesla Model S, then the Gravity is the Model X until Lucid's ""Project Midsize"" can effectively become its Model Y.
Except I'd wager that the Model X was never quite the hit Tesla wanted it to be, and Lucid has no room for error at this point in its rise. Here's the latest from Automotive News on its financial situation:
Lucid needs the Gravity to be a hit, analysts said. The EV maker reported a third-quarter net loss of $950 million. That was wider than its second-quarter net loss of $790 million and its first-quarter net loss of $681 million. Lucid is majority owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The company said in its third-quarter earnings report that it had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.
Lucid’s stock price was down by about 50 percent from the start of the year to its closing price Dec. 5.
And then there's the question of price. The three-row Gravity will commence sales with the fairly loaded Grand Touring trim, and that will mean starting at $96,550 out of the gate. More affordable versions are expected to roll out but not until late 2025, and it's unclear if customer deliveries will start next year or in the remaining weeks of this one. Whenever that starts happening, we'll be looking closely at whether Gravity sales can propel Lucid to a more stable financial footing and prove to be a winner with buyers.
On its own, the Gravity seems to be a very impressive SUV; I've only sat in a few examples at auto shows so far but it's quite the stunner. The Grand Touring will pack an outstanding 440 miles of range as well. We'll have more on InsideEVs this week about what to expect from Lucid's next act.
GM Ultium platform with Samsung SDI prismatic batteries
Recent unpleasantness aside, America has every reason in the world to want to keep South Korea as a good friend. It's a crucial trading partner, a like-minded ally in a region increasingly dominated by China and a huge technology investor in this country as well. South Korea's battery expertise and industry are probably second overall to China's (albeit a very distant second, unfortunately) so the U.S. does need its help to catch up there.
Yet the copious battery plant investments in the U.S. from companies like LG, SK On, Samsung and various suppliers are starting to look a little uncertain if the incoming Trump administration does in fact revoke the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax breaks and other subsidies. Here's Bloomberg to explain:
Some Korean companies have slowed or hit the pause button on any ongoing construction of some plants because they’re concerned about reduced demand for EVs and what Trump would do during a second term in the White House, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Posco Future M, which makes cathodes for General Motors Co., said in a filing in September that it is delaying the completion of its plant in Quebec due to “local conditions.”
Although companies haven’t taken any action yet, many are “anxious” about to what degree Trump would slash government incentives for the EV market, said Kenny Kim, chief executive officer at SNE Research, a Seoul-based research firm that focuses on Korean battery makers.
Ending hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, tax credits and other incentives would threaten tens of thousands of US jobs and undo years of work shifting the global EV supply chain away from China. It could also hit the earnings of Korean firms, key US partners in the effort to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers, at a time when they’re already suffering from weaker demand for EVs and falling battery prices.
And then there's the problem with China. Trump's calculus there could be quite different from Biden's, including allowing more of that country's battery plants to invest here as part of some kind of broader trade deal. This would be devastating to such an important U.S. ally:
Korean companies also worry Trump might allow Chinese battery companies to enter the US. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd, or CATL, said it will consider building a US plant if Trump opens the door, Reuters reported last month.
The IRA has so far blocked investments from China, asking carmakers to gradually reduce sourcing critical battery minerals from “foreign entities of concern.”
“China’s entry to the US would be a disaster for Korea,” said Park Chulwan, a professor in the car engineering department at Seojeong University. “Chinese battery firms would offer much lower prices.”
We're in for a very interesting year ahead.
2025 Rivian R1S
But hey, it's not all doom and gloom on the EV front. If you're a fan of Rivian, or have money in the company, things are looking up with its stock price. RIVN has gained quite a bit over the past month amid its investment from Volkswagen, declining sales of electric competitors, a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan and a healthier overall balance sheet. From The Motley Fool:
Rivian's R1T is one of just a few electric pickup truck offerings. Tesla has entered the market with its unique Cybertruck, but the R1T's biggest competition is arguably Ford's F-150 Lightning. And it's news about the Ford EV that may have had Rivian stock jumping by nearly 10% Friday morning. At 1:55 p.m. ET, Rivian shares still held on to a gain of 4.5%. The move has helped Rivian stock log an increase of more than 20% in the last month.
Last month, Rivian told investors it expects to deliver between 50,500 and 52,000 EVs this year. That would only slightly surpass 2023 deliveries. But the company also recently provided encouraging news related to its future capital position. And it is preparing to start production of its next-generation R2 platform next year as well.
That has bolstered the stock recently, and yesterday it got another boost when Ford released its November vehicle sales update. That's because sales of Ford's F-150 Lightning plunged by 17% last month year over year.
Still, Rivian is a long ways off from the launch of the R2. We'll see how it can keep this momentum going in the meantime.

Would You Ride This Weird Solar-Powered Electric Scooter?,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743297/otherlab-lightfoot-solar-powered-escooter/,Maybe if it was the only way to get around after the end of the world.,2024-12-25 01:25:38,"We’ve seen some pretty crazy e-mobility gadgets and gizmos over the years—everything from ultra-high powered e-bikes to electric scooters that look like they belong in a sci-fi movie. But the weirdest and most attention-grabbing of them all just has to be this electric scooter that’s powered by good old-fashioned sun juice.
It’s called Lightfoot, the brainchild of Otherlab, a mobility startup with a knack for all sorts of weird and wonderful inventions. They describe it as a sun-powered cargo scooter perfect for short trips. Think of it as a cross between a bicycle and an e-scooter—easy to use, undeniably practical, and pretty charming.
With a top speed of 20 miles per hour, it’s not going to win any drag races. But it’s got retro vibes inspired by classics like Vespa scooters and even the VW bus, at least according to Otherlab. The company markets it as a fun, do-it-all micromobility device.
But personally? I think looks like the kind of thing you’d rely on if the world was ending and gas pumps—and maybe even power outlets—were a thing of the past.
Picture this: the world has fallen victim to a massive solar storm or some apocalyptic event where the power grid is rendered useless. What’s left? The sun, of course. And with Lightfoot capable of making up to 20% of its power from the sun’s rays, it just might be your ticket to survival. That is, assuming you’re not fighting off zombies, of course.
Here’s what’s under the two massive solar panels that double as the two-wheeler's bodywork: a 48-volt, 1.1 kWh battery feeding two 750-watt motors that crank out 90 Nm (67 pound-feet) of torque. It can handle pretty much any hill, making it perfect for navigating a desolate wasteland—or just your local neighborhood with some steep climbs. It’s got a range of 37 miles per charge, so you won’t be left stranded.
On cloudy days, or when you need to go out at night, you won’t need to worry, either. And that’s because the Lightfoot isn't powered solely by the sun. The scooter is equipped with an onboard 600W charger that can juice it up to 80 percent in 90 minutes from a standard 110-volt socket.
With all that being said, we’re not in a post-apocalyptic world just yet, but the Lightfoot is definitely not your average e-scooter. In a sea of sleek, modern designs, this retro, steampunk oddball sticks out—and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, sometimes being different is what makes all the difference.

How To Maximize Your Electric Car's Range In Cold Winter Weather,https://insideevs.com/news/650826/maximize-ev-range-in-winter/,"Electric cars are known for losing efficiency in the winter. However, there are many ways to recuperate these losses.",2024-12-09 08:44:25,"Electric cars boast excellent efficiency, performance, and versatility, especially when compared to their ICE counterparts. However, EVs are notorious for getting hit with substantial range losses in cold weather. These efficiency blows generate some concern with prospective owners in northern climates. But, there are ways to nullify some cold weather losses and maintain a respectable energy consumption figure.
YESSS Electrical recently compiled a list of the best ways to increase winter range. Without further adieu, here are the best ways to improve your EV's overall usability in the winter.
In the dead of winter, preconditioning your battery prior to plugging in can mean much faster DC fast charging times. Since Li-ion batteries like to be relatively warm to rapidly charge or discharge, preconditioning the battery pack before charging gets your EV's battery ready for a speedy charging session.
Some EVs, like Tesla products, have this feature built into the UI, so the battery will automatically warm up before arriving at the station. This feature isn't available in every EV, but if yours is equipped, it'll mean that your car can reach its maximum charge rate much faster.
Leaving your EV sitting out in the cold, especially unplugged, must be avoided at all costs if you want to maximize range. Doing this is commonly referred to as ""cold-soaking,"" and the disadvantages are omnipresent. Besides taking a considerable efficiency loss when driving, DC charge rates will be reduced, and power could be limited too. If you can't park your car inside, try to leave it plugged in so you can at least warm the car with shore power before driving.
The best way to maximize your charge is to use shore power to heat up your ride directly. Instead of waiting until driving to begin heating the cabin, doing so while charging is the best way to conserve your battery's energy. The best time to do this is around 15 minutes before you leave.
Some EVs allow you to set scheduled departure times, allowing the car to activate the cabin heater automatically. Plus, once the cabin is sufficiently warmed, you can tick down the fan speed while driving to avoid using excess energy.
With electric cars (and plug-in hybrids, for that matter), keeping your car's tires within manufacturer specs is ideal for getting the best range. Since electric powertrains are so efficient, unnecessary friction resulting from improperly inflated tires will eat into your car's range.
Tesla says that a 6-degree Celsius (10-degree Fahrenheit) drop results in a loss of 1 PSI. This means that once the weather gets cold, checking your pressure is vital to maintain the intended specifications.
In the winter, the cold temperatures will reduce your EV's overall efficiency. Keeping this in mind, it's essential to drive especially nicely to account for the losses. This means that instead of driving at 75 mph on the freeway, it might help to tick down your speed to 70 mph.
Cold weather also might adversely affect your vehicle's regen abilities, so anticipating stops is equally important. Overall, if you plan on going on a winter road trip, it's important to consider ways like these to boost your efficiency.
Whether or not your EV has a heat pump, it'll still make a difference to utilize the seat heater over the heating system in cold conditions. Especially if you preheat the cabin while charging, running the cabin heater may be unnecessary. In this case, utilizing the seat heater could be a supplemental addition for comfort without the expense of using the entire cabin climate system.

Winter Highway Range Test Compares Three New Electric Luxury SUVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743632/macan-q6-polestar3-winter-range/,"The Audi Q6 E-Tron, Porsche Macan EV and Polestar 3 are priced to compete with one another, but which one uses fewer electrons?",2024-12-09 06:36:20,"Cold temperatures make EVs use more electricity, which can reduce their range by as much as 50% in some cases. Even the newest models, like the Audi Q6 E-Tron, Porsche Macan EV and Polestar 3, which feature the latest advancements in battery chemistry and thermal management, are at their least efficient in winter. If you also drive them at highway speeds, the range takes an even bigger hit.
Kris Rifa from Norway brought these three posh new electric crossovers together for a group highway winter range test. All three vehicles were driven at a constant 75 mph (120 km/h) on a 120-mile (194 km) route, and their average efficiency was monitored throughout the trip.
The test was done in Norway with temperatures as low as 23°F (-5°C), which made all three EVs a lot less efficient than advertised. The temperature inside the vehicles was set to 70°F (21°C), and they were exclusively driven in their most efficient mode. The Macan EV didn’t have a range-boosting mode so it was driven in normal.
Of the trio, the Polestar 3 (which was the largest of the trio with the longest wheelbase) was rated as being the most luxurious, quiet and comfortable for highway driving, while the Audi was considerably noisier than the other two EVs. The Polestar also had the largest battery pack of the test (107 kilowatt-hours usable versus 94.9 kWh in the mechanically related Porsche and Audi).
At the end of the test, which involved going up and down the same piece of highway, the Polestar looked like it was capable of delivering the longest range. They didn’t drain the three vehicles’ batteries all the way down and instead calculated the theoretical maximum range by looking at the usable battery pack and efficiency numbers.
The Polestar 3 long-range dual-motor used in the test had an average electricity consumption of 2.15 miles/kWh (28.8 kWh/100 km), which gave it a theoretical range of 225 miles (360 km) or around 57% of its claimed WLTP range of 394 miles (634 km). This variant has a more conservative EPA range of 315 miles (507 km).
Next came the Audi Q6 E-Tron Quattro, which was the most efficient of the three cars tested, averaging 2.42 miles/kWh (25.7 kWh/100 km), and it almost matched the Polestar for theoretical range with 223.9 miles (358 km). That’s 64% of its WLTP range of 344 miles (554 km) and even closer to its 307 miles (494 km) EPA rating.
Even though the Porsche Macan is built on the same PPA platform as the Q6 E-Tron, the Macan 4 used in this test was less efficient than the Audi (likely because of its larger wheels). It averaged 2.28 miles/kWh (27.2 kWh/100km), which only gave it a theoretical range of 211.5 miles (338 km) or around 63% of its WLTP range. The EPA rates the Macan 4 at 308 miles, one mile more than the Q6 E-Tron with the same configuration.
Kris also released a video showing a more in-depth side-by-side comparison of the three vehicles and he also charges them after the range test without preconditioning their batteries with interesting results. What struck me while watching these two videos was just how different the Audi and the Porsche are even though they are mechanically very similar just how tasteful the Polestar's interior looks.

Here’s What A Zero Star EV Crash Test Looks Like,https://insideevs.com/news/743705/zero-star-ev-crash-test/,"Lacking basic safety equipment like seatbelt pre-tensioners and load limiters, the Neta V is becoming famous for all the wrong reasons.",2024-12-09 06:32:33,"New cars are supposed to be much safer than their predecessors. With cutting-edge development and manufacturing techniques, you’re more likely to walk away from a car crash today than you were a decade ago. Sure, the car might be totaled, but that’s just metal, it can be replaced–your life can’t.
That’s the idea, at least. But not all cars are created equal. Enter the Neta V, a Chinese-made relatively affordable electric car that’s also sold in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand. It’s a front-wheel drive subcompact crossover with a theoretical range of up to 249 miles and basic amenities.
Priced between the equivalent of about $18,000 and $22,000, depending on the market, it’s billed as a “Stylish and Intelligent SUV for Young.” It’s also one of the least safe new cars on sale in the world today.
More EV Safety
After being crash tested by the New Car Assessment Program for Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP), the Neta V received a total safety score of zero stars out of five. Similar performances–or rather, disappointing results–were scored by the venerable Renault Zoe EV, as well as another Chinese-made EV, the JAC E10x.
According to ASEAN NCAP, the Neta V got zero points for the frontal offset crash test, where the driver dummy had “poor protection on the head, neck, chest and lower leg.” The Motorcycle Safety score was also zero. For what it’s worth, the EV got some points for adult occupant protection, child occupant protection and safety assist systems for a grand total of 28.55 points out of 100 possible.
After the frontal offset crash test, where the car moves at 40 miles per hour before slamming into a barrier, the A-pillar and steering wheel were displaced from their original position. ASEAN NCAP noted that the EV has a “weak body structure” and “compromised restraint system” that greatly endangers occupant safety.
The Neta V comes as standard with just two front airbags, a seatbelt reminder for the driver, ABS and stability control. There are no advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), no seatbelt retractor pre-tensioners and no seatbelt load limiters.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis Promises Half-Price Lithium-Sulfur EV Batteries ‘By 2030’,https://insideevs.com/news/743674/stellantis-cheaper-lithium-sulfur-ev-batteries-2030/,"The auto giant is joining forces with Zeta Energy to bring cheaper, lighter and faster-charging EV batteries to market by the end of the decade.",2024-12-09 03:36:45,"Solid-state batteries are not the only technology that promises increased range, lower manufacturing costs and lower weight. It’s also not the only technology that’s “just around the corner” for tomorrow’s electric vehicles.
Lithium-sulfur batteries carry many of the same promises as solid-state cells. They’ve been around for decades and are known among scientists for their great energy density, but a huge problem has been keeping them from going mainstream: they have a tendency to degrade quite quickly, making them unsuitable for electric cars that need to provide consistent driving ranges for years and year.
Here’s where Stellantis and its new partner, Zeta Energy, come into play. The two companies announced they’re working on a new generation of lithium-sulfur batteries that have the potential to provide the same usable energy as today’s liquid-based lithium-ion batteries but at half the price. They’re also poised to offer 50% more driving range and 50% faster charging sessions, which could make EV ownership a breeze.
More Battery Stuff
Development is already underway and the agreement includes both pre-production and planning for future scale production by 2030.
“Our collaboration with Zeta Energy is another step in helping advance our electrification strategy as we work to deliver clean, safe and affordable vehicles,” said Ned Curic, Chief Engineering and Technology Officer at Stellantis. “Groundbreaking battery technologies like lithium-sulfur can support Stellantis’ commitment to carbon neutrality by 2038 while ensuring our customers enjoy optimal range, performance and affordability.”
Another huge benefit of lithium-sulfur cells is they don’t require cobalt, graphite, manganese or nickel, which are mainly sourced from outside the United States and Europe. Instead, they’re produced using waste materials, unrefined sulfur and methane. Furthermore, existent battery facilities can be used to manufacture the cells with materials sourced exclusively from domestic supply chains in Europe or North America.
This isn’t the only battery-related project brewing at Stellantis. The auto giant is also working on solid-state batteries with Factorial, and the first Dodge Charger EV pilot fleet with liquid-less cells is slated to hit the streets by 2026.",Iulian Dnistran
Rivian Is Last In Consumer Reports' Reliability List. Owners Still Love Them,https://insideevs.com/news/743627/rivian-reliability-cr-satisfaction/,"The EV truck and SUV startup ranked last for reliability, but first overall in owner satisfaction. How?",2024-12-08 12:00:00,"What's a few software glitches, powertrain issues and battery faults between you and a car you truly love?
Two recently released studies from Consumer Reports might be called good news and bad news for Rivian. In two new surveys, the California-based electric vehicle startup found itself at the top of one list and the bottom of another: first in overall owner satisfaction, yet dead last in reliability among the brands the nonprofit magazine was able to test.
This marks the second consecutive year that Rivian's R1S and R1T scored top honors in owner satisfaction, which is based on survey responses from Consumer Reports members who are asked if their new vehicles ""met or failed to meet customers’ expectations in various important ways."" A whopping 86% of Rivian owners who responded to the survey also indicated they would buy from the brand again.
""We’ve presented the brands that most satisfy owners in specific areas: overall comfort, driving enjoyment, cabin storage, usability, and ownership cost,"" Consumer Reports said. Rivian led the 2024 survey, followed by BMW, Tesla, Porsche and Lexus, in that order.
Rivian CR Study
Rivian CR Study 2
But as the publication notes, that doesn't necessarily mean a problem-free driving experience. Subaru was ranked CR's most overall reliable brand but was only midpack in terms of owner satisfaction. BMW too only finished in the middle of the reliability surveys, while Chevrolet—the top non-luxury brand in satisfaction—was even lower when it came to reliability. (If you want a car that ranks high in both, get a Lexus.)
Owners ranked their Rivians high for comfort, speed, drivability and ease of use. They may also have been won over by the cars' specs. While their large size and brick-like shape can hurt their electric efficiency, Rivian's EVs offer between 260 to 400 miles of range or more and boast some of the most advanced software features available in the U.S. EV market, including continual over-the-air updates.
2025 Rivian R1S
But as we reported earlier this week, because they represent a new type of technology that's less ironed out than the purely internal combustion vehicles made over the last century, EVs and hybrids do seem to have more issues than their conventional counterparts. Thankfully, CR told InsideEVs in an email, that's changing quickly. ""On average, EVs from the past three model years have had 42% more problems than gas-only cars, according to our exclusive survey data. That might sound like a lot, but the figure represents a significant improvement over our previous year’s survey results when EVs had 79% more problems than gas-only cars.""
Rivian's issues were not uncommon to some new EVs: problems with charging systems and electric motors, frustrations with in-cabin technology like the central touchscreen, climate system headaches and more. Yet some of Rivian's quality problems also speak to the nature of being a startup that's new to making cars: paint and trim issues, noises and leaks, hardware issues and more. ""All of that confirms what our survey data has told us for years,"" CR said. ""Tried-and-true designs tend to be more reliable, and consumers would be wise to wait a few years before purchasing a vehicle that’s been designed—or redesigned—from scratch."" (CR lacked sufficient owner data for other newcomers like Polestar and Lucid.)
2025 Rivian R1
The publication certainly isn't wrong there and another EV startup is a good example. For years, Tesla also ranked at the top of owner satisfaction surveys but the bottom of reliability and quality reports. Yet while it still struggles with new model launches, Tesla's overall build quality has gotten much better over the years; cars like the Model 3 and Model Y scored ""average"" in CR reliability reports. The brand as a whole still ranks toward the bottom of CR's rankings, however, but above traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Jeep.
The takeaway here? People love what their Rivians can do for them, but like many startups, the company has a ways to go to improve its overall build quality and how seamless its user experience can be. Hopefully Rivian can do this as it continues to ramp up its Normal, Illinois plant and expands into an all-new one in Georgia.

"Tesla FSD Tester: V13.2 Is 'Unbelievable, Incredible' But Still Has Bugs",https://insideevs.com/news/743617/tesla-fsd-v13-impresses-reviewer/,"FSD still has a long way to go before it makes something like a fully autonomous robotaxi real, but the progress is easy to spot.",2024-12-08 10:00:40,"Tesla has incrementally improved its Full Self-Driving suite over the years, but some new versions have proved better. FSD version 13.2 is one of those versions that marks a more significant leap with its newly added features and general improvements. The biggest news is its ability to move the car out of a parking spot and search for parking at or around its destination.
Version 13.2 has only been rolled out to early-access members of the FSD program, and it's been getting rave reviews. Although testers also praised FSD V12 as a big step forward, V13.2 seems to be a huge leap in comparison. Don’t get too excited, though, because as promising as the new version is, the road ahead until FSD achieves true unsupervised autonomous driving is still long.
Before V13 began being pushed to users, Elon Musk said this new version was “trending to be ~500% better,” hinting that it was a major upgrade over V12. Now, we have to wait and see how it performs once it reaches all those who are part of the FSD program. Gauging how good it is will basically boil down to how many critical disengagements they observe over a set distance and if there are noticeably fewer of them than before.
One video that we previously covered showed that while FSD still has a few bugs to iron out, especially when it comes to finding parking once it’s completed a set route, this is FSD’s best showing so far—driving from point to point is smoother and more confidence-inspiring than before. AI Drivr called it “unbelievable,” “incredible” and “mind-blowing” several times during the almost 40-minute-long drive that they posted a few days ago.
Situations like the right turn followed immediately by a left turn shown at the start of the video would not have been handled as smoothly as V13.2 did. Even though the car had to take a lot into account to perform the maneuver, especially considering how heavy the traffic was—which required extra incisiveness—it did it about as well as a human driver.
AI Drivr also engaged FSD while their Model Y was parked beside a Supercharger. It was really cool to see the car not setting off immediately as it checked its surroundings and waited for a gap in traffic. Being in the leftmost charging stall right next to a curb, the car could have easily scratched its wheels when it made its left turn, but it detected that and pulled to the right before making the left turn.
What’s even cooler about that particular instance was that the car changed its route through the parking lot on the fly. While it initially suggested that it would go right after coming out of the parking spot, it actually first made a left and then turned right, giving a glimpse at its neural network-powered decision-making in action on the fly.
It also slowed down enough for speed bumps, which wasn’t always the case with V12, or older iterations. The FSD tester concluded that V13.2 “is freakishly good. By far the biggest step change improvement from any version that has EVER come out. It still has some small weird bugs (refer to video) and also executes some pretty aggressive maneuvers at times (even on ’Standard’ profile) that I think would be a disengagement for the majority of people, but I absolutely love it.”

The EU Is Pushing For Stricter E-Scooter Safety Standards,https://www.rideapart.com/news/742989/eu-scooter-safety-standards-recommended/,"E-scooters have been around for a while now, so why is the EU only acting now?",2024-12-25 01:25:41,"For many people around the world, electric scooters and other small e-mobility devices have changed their lives. Moving around the city has never been this easy. Simply charge up your little scoot, throw on your going-out clothes and maybe a backpack, and be on your merry way. No more queueing up at a bus stop or dealing with apps like Uber or Lyft.
But as is always the case when it comes to all things mobility, a balance between safety and convenience always has to be struck.Up until now, rules and regulations surrounding the use of e-scooters have been inconsistent and confusing at best. This is where the ETSC, or the European Transport Safety Council steps in, as it now calls for the development of mandatory requirements for all e-scooters sold in the European Union.It’s about damn time, isn’t it?It all seems pretty reasonable, really, and it’s surprising that the EU is adopting these measures only now, especially given that so many e-scooter-based ride-sharing platforms have been banned across Europe due to safety concerns.
E-scooters are recommended to have a top speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
So, what are the technical requirements? Well, for starters, all e-scooters should include a speed limiter set at 20 kilometers per hour (around 12.4 miles per hour). Minimum braking and maximum acceleration parameters will also be set. So yeah, no more “super e-scooters” capable of hitting speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour.
But apart from mandating technical requirements surrounding scooters, the ETSC also recommends regulating folks who can actually ride them. For starters, the council recommends a minimum age of 16 for e-scooter riders. Plus, riders will also be required to wear a helmet every time they hop aboard an e-scooter. Naturally, individuals who have consumed alcohol or are under the influence of drugs, will not be allowed to ride.
All these regulations make sense, right? And there are numbers to back them all up. The ETSC highlights that there have been 119 reported road deaths in 2022, all of which involve “motorized micro-mobility devices,” of which the vast majority are electric scooters. And the fact that between half and two-thirds of the reported deaths involved riders who were intoxicated makes this even more grim.
So yeah, play stupid games, win stupid prizes, I guess.
But things might actually be much worse than they seem. The ETSC reports that many crashes and injuries involving e-scooters involve only the rider, and no one else. As such, it’s more than likely that the number of e-scooter fatalities is actually much higher, it’s just that there are lots of unreported cases as the police may not necessarily have been called to the scene.

"Non-Tesla EV Roadtrips 'Sucked' Last Year. Now, They're ‘Dramatically’ Better",https://insideevs.com/news/743502/non-tesla-ev-road-trip-ccs-or-supercharger/,Is having access to the Tesla Supercharger network really such a big deal? This YouTuber set out to find out.,2024-12-07 10:00:02,"The list of non-Tesla electric cars that can access the Tesla Supercharger network in the United States and Canada is growing. Fast. Overnight, owners of EVs like the Rivian R1T, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Chevrolet Blazer EV suddenly received access to over 17,000 fast chargers that were previously exclusive to Tesla owners.
That’s on top of what’s already available from the myriad of smaller public charging operators like EVgo, Electrify America, ChargePoint and more, whose charging stalls more often than not come with CCS cables instead of Tesla’s NACS connector.
In total, owners of EVs that can top-up at both Tesla Superchargers and CCS stalls from other operators have over 37,000 ports at their disposal in the United States, according to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center. The Tesla Supercharger network has over 28,000 ports, but roughly 10,000 of those are still exclusive to Tesla EVs.
More Stuff Like This
In other words, there’s a lot of choice. So much so, that Robert Dunn from the Aging Wheels YouTube asked if having access to the Tesla Supercharger network is really such a big deal now. So he set out to see what the charging situation was like on a 400-mile trip from Saint Louis, Missouri to Chattanooga. Tennessee.
Last year, he did the experiment using a Polestar 2 and a rented Tesla Model 3. In the Tesla, he only used Superchargers and the experience was flawless. In the Polestar, he only used CCS chargers and he had nothing but issues.
This year, he repeated the experiment with the same Polestar 2 and a Kia EV6. The Polestar now has access to the Supercharger network and that’s what was used to top-up the batteries, while the Kia was only recharged at CCS fast chargers.
Dunn tried almost every charger on the 400-mile route, albeit for short periods of time, just to see if the stalls worked and how fast they were. The short answer is that things have improved “dramatically” since last year. Old CCS chargers were either upgraded or replaced, and more of them have been installed along the route.
The long answer is in the video embedded above.
Some CCS chargers were a bit of a pain in the neck to activate, and there’s still the need for multiple smartphone apps to use all of them, but the good part is that, at least on this route, things are much better. So better in fact, that you might not even need to use Superchargers in a non-Tesla EV during a road trip, but if you need them, they’re there.
More choice means less charger anxiety and fewer worries.",Iulian Dnistran
Could Mass EV Adoption Save Motorcycles In Vietnam's Major Cities?,https://www.rideapart.com/features/743279/vietnam-ev-motorcycles-pollution-2030/,"By 2030, big changes are coming to the nation's riding habits, one way or another.",2024-12-25 01:25:42,"If you pay any attention to those periodic lists of the top cities in the world with the worst air pollution, chances are excellent that you've seen Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, on the list more than once.And of course, if you either live there or have ever visited, you probably weren't surprised. More likely, you were just happy to confirm your sneaking suspicion that it's not great for any living creatures that like to, you know, breathe.
As you may or may not be aware, Vietnam is also a nation where two-wheeled transportation is massively popular. There are cars, buses, and trucks on public roads, too, but it's hard to understate the sheer volume of motorbikes you'll see on the road (and the sidewalk), especially if you visit any major city. I've been there; I've seen it in person. The flitting and zooming of untold numbers of small-displacement motorbikes in Hanoi puts even Bangkok to shame.
Put another way, Statista noted that over 65 million motorcycles were registered in the country as of 2020. Just four years later, Agence France-Presse (AFP) estimated the number at closer to 77 million. And the majority of these motorbikes are small-displacement ICE machines.
Of course, if you live or work in a major city like Hanoi, you have a vested interest in making your air quality better. So, even though so many everyday people rely on bikes as their main means of transportation, that's why more than one effort to restrict or even ban motorbikes from certain congested areas has arisen over the years.
In June 2023, the city of Hanoi's People's Committee officially approved a motorcycle restriction program for 12 major districts of the city. If enacted as planned, it would result in a total ban on motorcycles in those districts by 2030. Ouch.
As we stand on the precipice of 2025, that's only five years away. That's likely why both the government and Vietnam's homegrown EV industry are pushing so hard to get riders to adopt EV motorbikes en masse. So far, they have yet to catch on in big numbers, for a number of reasons you've probably already seen raised in other markets as well. While the bikes on sale can be charged at home, charging-related fires are a motivating fear.
Misinformation about a fire in Hanoi in 2023 that killed 56 people reportedly resulted in other apartment buildings putting the kibosh on EV charging altogether. An investigation by police later revealed that EV charging wasn't the cause of that fire, but by the time the truth came to light, the damage to public confidence was already done.
Hanoi Plans Motorcycle Ban
There are also the usual concerns about lengthy charging times, as well as up-front costs to purchase a whole new motorbike and concerns about the high cost of future battery replacement once your original battery is no longer usable.
OEMs are addressing these issues in different ways. When I had the chance to ride several of Vinfast's electric scooters a couple of years ago, the company touted a program where riders could purchase the scooter outright, and then pay a low subscription fee for the battery.
And while I'm usually against anything that resembles ""software-as-a-service"" or ""battery-as-a-service"" or (shudder) ""motorcycle-as-a-service,"" this idea actually made sense to me.
Why? Because EV batteries are, in a single word, expensive.
Under this plan, Vinfast would own the battery, and once its charge capacity dipped below a certain point spelled out in the agreement that you'd sign, you'd be able to simply return it to the company in exchange for a new one. Assuming the company kept its word and honored that agreement, it seemed like the kind of thing that could do a lot to allay fears of suddenly having an EV motorbike-shaped paperweight parked out front.
That was two years ago. And although Vinfast's EV cars have received a slew of negative reviews here in the States since their release, their scooters (which we don't so far get) still seem to have this battery subscription model available in their home country in 2024. And the costs of ownership are exactly the same as they were when I first rode them, according to the Vinfast website. What else can you say that about in 2024?
But what if, for any number of valid reasons, you don't want to charge your EV motorbike at home? That's where another Vietnamese EV motorbike maker called Selex is aiming its offerings. Since so many riders use motorbikes as delivery vehicles, it's aiming its swappable battery-equipped Selex Camel firmly at those riders. And it's been busy setting up battery swapping stations in major cities, so that riders can simply pull up, swap batteries, and be on their way with minimal time lost.
The road to EV motorbike adoption is all uphill at this point. But if enough people adopted them in Hanoi and beyond, could that convince the city to reconsider enacting its pending motorcycle ban? It seems like the most agreeable solution for the greatest number of riders, honestly, so here's hoping it does.

Record Hybrid Sales Helped Boost 'Green' Car Sales In Q3,https://insideevs.com/news/743562/record-hybrid-sales-boost-electrified/,"EV sales also grew compared to last quarter, but their market share shrank slightly.",2024-12-06 17:14:09,"Although Americans bought more new electric vehicles in the third quarter of 2024 than in the previous quarter, EVs had a lower share of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) market in Q3. Their share dropped from 7.4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3. Still, sales and market share are both up over Q3 2023.
The overall share of electrified vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids and EVs) increased ilast quarter, helped by the surge in popularity of non-plug-in hybrids, which made up 10.8% of the entire U.S. LDV market. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says this is a new record.
Tesla still holds nearly half of the market (48.8%), followed by General Motors, Hyundai and Ford. The EIA also quotes information from Wards Intelligence, which says 78.9% of all EVs bought in the U.S. in Q3 were made in North America, 7.3% came from South Korea, and 5.3% were German-made.
EIA sales
This huge share of American-made EVs is a direct result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which changed the requirements for EVs to qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit. Before, most EVs sold in the U.S. qualified for the full credit. But the requirements were tightened for 2024, making the list of eligible EVs much shorter (and it could get even shorter). They now have to be made in the U.S., with battery components and minerals sourced only from certain places—they can’t come from China, for instance. Of course, all of these restrictions do not apply to vehicles that are leased due to a loophole in the legislation.
Most EVs purchased in Q3 (70.7%) were luxury models, which is still a lot, but the EIA says it’s the lowest level recorded since Q2 2017. That's because the data considers Tesla a luxury manufacturer, and the company still accounts for around half of all EVs sold. Plus, there's an acute lack of affordable EVs in the U.S., so the average price of a new EV before incentives in Q3 was $56,351, or 16% higher than the national average.
If we just look at sales numbers, more EVs were delivered in the U.S. this year than in 2023. Over 346,000 EVs were sold through the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 5% over 2023. EVs accounted for 8.9% of all new cars sold, an increase from 7.8% last year.
Ford is in fourth place for the number of EVs sold this year in America, but it could be picking up the pace after a record-breaking November when sales amounted to 11,000 units (21% up year-over-year). It was actually second behind Tesla last month, although one good month alone wasn’t enough to move it into the top three.
Here's More About EV Sales
Honda also had strong sales toward the end of the year, selling more than 6,800 Prologues in November, marking a 66% rise over October. The GM-built Prologue sold over 25,000 units from January through November, placing it among the country’s top five best-selling EVs.
Some automakers seem to have caught some extra sales wind as the year draws to a close. It will be interesting to see the end-of-year data, given that this was widely regarded as a year when EV sales cooled, mainly affected by high prices and the stricter federal tax credit rules. With a new president who is less friendly toward EVs and foreign imports than his predecessor, 2025 will also be one to watch out for on the EV scene.",Andrei Nedelea
This Tiny Electric Pickup Has A Not-So-Tiny Price Tag,https://insideevs.com/news/743532/telo-mt1-pricing-announced/,"The pint-sized Telo EV starts at $41,520 and can reach almost $50,000 in dual-motor long-range guise.",2024-12-06 14:00:02,"There aren’t enough small electric pickups in America, but California-based Telo wants to change that. Its adorable MT1 measures just 152 inches in total length, or about the same size as a subcompact car, but it promises serious performance and range for such a small package, which is why it’s not cheap.
Telo just launched a configurator for its pickup, starting at $41,520. For that, you get it with a single 300-horsepower motor that powers the rear wheels. Its standard battery pack provides a claimed 260 miles of range. Upgrade to the long-range pack with 106 kilowatt-hours for $3,980 to increase the range to 350 miles.
If you want a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration, that pushes the starting price to $46,019, but it increases the combined power output to 500 hp. This variant accelerates to 60 mph (96 km/h) from a standstill in 4 seconds, and its top speed is 125 mph (201 km/h).
Fast charging can add 210 miles of range in 20 minutes in vehicles equipped with the large battery. The manufacturer hasn’t shared any additional charging details yet other than the fact that it will come with a standard NACS port.
Even though the MT1 has the footprint of a Mini Cooper SE, it has a crew cab capable of seating five, and its 60-inch bed is longer than that of a Rivian R1T, and it matches a Toyota Tacoma. It also has a removable midgate that extends the bed into the cab.
With the midgate out, you can add a third row of seats, which you can leave out and open to the elements, or you can close off the bed area, essentially turning the MT1 into a small van. The bed also has a lockable tonneau cover, so you can use it like the trunk of a normal car.
With a payload capacity of 1,600 pounds and the ability to tow up to 6,600 pounds, the MT1 shouldn’t have a problem performing as a small work truck. Its layout, somewhere between a traditional truck with a long hood and a cab-forward design, helps with its compactness, maneuverability in tight places and forward visibility.
Telo says it has over 3,700 reservations for the MT1, and you can pre-order yours with a $152 deposit. The order book is, therefore, not officially open yet, and the company says it may still adjust the pricing. Production is planned to start next year, with the first 500 units being hand-built. If it enters production as planned, it will be the smallest new pickup on the market and it will compete with trucks like the larger Ford Maverick hybrid, which is considerably cheaper.

Tesla Robotaxi Will Have 50% Fewer Parts Than Model 3,https://insideevs.com/news/743506/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-half-parts/,"That's one way to get the price below $30,000.",2024-12-06 13:00:00,"Tesla's Robotaxi concept is all about doing more with less. Whether that be parts, humans behind the wheel, or dollars spent on the car itself—the goal is to strip down the car as much as possible to drive down the cost of production.
Tesla has gotten very good at this, as it revealed at the first stop on a public showing tour of the Robotaxi at its flagship showroom at Santana Row in San Jose, California. During a discussion with the principal engineer of the Robotaxi project, it was revealed that engineers have managed to cut the number of parts in the Cybercab prototype down to just half of what's found in the production version of the Tesla Model 3 today.
""Two seats unlocks a lot of opportunity aerodynamically,"" said Eric, Tesla's lead engineer on the Robotaxi project. ""It also means we cut the part count of Cybercab down by a substantial margin. We're going to be delivering a car that has roughly half the parts of Model 3 today.""
The most obvious cost-cutting method is ditching that pesky steering wheel and pedals. Who needs those in a car that's supposed to drive itself, anyway? And while we're at it, let's just remove the entire rear seat assembly (and the two doors for the rear passengers). But there are also smaller changes, like only featuring three physical switches: two on the center console—the purpose of which has been argued to be either for the windows or doors—and one for the dome light.
Another example is the roof, which you'll notice is metal rather than glass. Folks on Twitter who were at the event say that while the metal roof may be cheaper and easier to unpack in Tesla's new ""unboxing"" production method, a Tesla engineer reportedly revealed that it proved to be quieter as well.
And perhaps one of the most behind-the-scenes ways that Tesla saved on parts count is the vehicle structure. According to a user on X who attended the event, the Robotaxi reportedly has just 80 parts in the body structure compared to the current Model Y's 200. Couple that with the car only supporting wireless charging and you'll quickly start to see how all of these tiny corner-cuts add up.
""This product is meant to be of extreme efficiency and we work really hard to deliver that. The efficiency isn't just on energy consumption-based, it's on the concept of cleaning,"" Tesla's engineer continued. ""It's also on the concept of reliability and service as well.""
The mantra behind Tesla's cybercab isn't the same as Colin Chapman's old adage ""simplify, then add lightness”—it's ""simplify for the sake of simplifying.""
Think of all the potential benefits of fewer parts: lower production cost, ease of repair, and greater reliability. Tesla is really flexing its production and engineering know-how with the Robotaxi project; a subtle brag and explanation of how Tesla projects that it can price the car under $30,000 without racing the rest of the world to the bottom. Now let's see them apply that same logic to solving panel gaps and alignment issues on existing new cars.
Of course, all this is for naught if Tesla can't solve self-driving. While its latest FSD v13 release is said to bring some major advancements, it still isn't perfect. If it wants to keep its ambitious Robotaxi release timeline of 2026, the automaker needs to fix a lot of edge-case scenarios very quickly. And that's something it's been trying to do since CEO Elon Musk first promised a fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive in 2016.

The VinFast VF6 Heads To Europe. It Could Undercut Chinese EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743519/vinfast-vf6-european-sales-announcement/,"Vinfast sees the VF6 as an important car to ""democratize EVs"" by making them smaller and more affordable.",2024-12-06 12:00:00,"Y’know, kudos to VinFast. Despite having one of the worst-reviewed cars in recent memory, which led to the Vietnamese startup having some of the slowest-selling models on the market, it hasn’t given up on its electric vehicle plans. The VF8 has gone through some improvements, which supposedly has made it tolerable to use. Its once missing-in-action VF9 three-row crossover is finally making its way to U.S. dealerships.
Similarly, VinFast just announced that its Chevy Bolt-sized VinFast VF6 is headed to Europe. This product announcement is a little more important than just yet another weird brand selling another small EV in Europe. VinFast wants this car to democratize EVs, and it thinks the VF6 could be a tool to get Europeans behind the wheel of reasonably priced EVs.
VInfast VF6 Europe
We really don’t know too much about the VF6 just yet, though. It was initially shown off as a preproduction concept about three years ago, but it looks like VinFast has stayed fairly close to that model. And yes, the VF6 is a real car; it’s been on Vietnamese roads for the past few months, rolling around in the hands of Vietnamese customers.
There are already a handful of Vietnamese-language videos and articles reviewing the VF6, but no media has really got their hands on the car outside of Vietnam.
Mechanically, the VF6 will be powered by a 201-horsepower motor powering the front wheels. The VF6’s 59.6 kWh LFP battery is good for 254 miles of range, based on the WLTP cycle. The car’s guts seem semi sophisticated though, since it uses a fully independent multi-link rear suspension rather than a semi-independent torsion beam commonly found on other cheap small EVs.
It's interesting to note that in the press release the brand sent over, VinFast harped on EV affordability. It quoted Boston Consulting Group, saying that ""the democratization of EVs depends on their ability to build an affordable B-segment for the European market.” It also said that 27% of all European cars are in this B-segment (subcompact), yet the electric offerings there are slim.
Currently, the VF6 is already open for reservations in France, Germany and The Netherlands, starting at just shy of $36,000 (33,900€). It wouldn’t be the cheapest EV in the segment, though. Cars like the Leapmotor T03 or Dacia Spring undercut the VF6 by a huge margin, but they’re much smaller cars with a lot less power and range. The new Ford Puma Gen-E is the same size class as VinFast’s VF6, and it is only slightly more expensive. But its 233-mile range means it can’t go as far. Could VinFast have a right-priced, right-sized hit on its hands here?
Vinfast VF6 at the 2022 Paris Motor Show
Maybe so. The VinFast VF6 could end up being a stealth hit in Europe for one reason: it is Vietnamese. Therefore, it’s not subject to double-digit anti-Chinese tariffs the EU has leveled against imported electric vehicles from China. Similarly, I think the VF6 could also be a surprise hit here in America. The VF6 (and VF7) genuinely appear to be better-executed products than the VF8. These products would be cheap, which should mean that buyers would be more willing to overlook a product’s shortcomings since it wouldn’t cost too much to buy.
I remain cautiously optimistic. If VinFast can keep its quality in check, and deliver a satisfying driving experience,  then the brand may have a future after all.

Tesla Leans Hard On The Tax Credits That Elon Musk Wants To Cut,https://insideevs.com/news/743523/tesla-holiday-ev-deals-musk-pushes-end-credits/,Tesla doesn't seem on track to meet its 2024 sales targets. Now it's leaning hard on holiday lease deals and offers to meet its goals.,2024-12-06 11:26:43,"It's a hypocrisy of epic proportions. A company led by a CEO who vehemently opposes federal incentives is now leveraging them aggressively as 2024 draws to a close. Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports ending the consumer EV credits, arguing they would ultimately benefit his company and hurt competitors—but as the year winds down, Tesla appears to be leaning into these subsidies more than ever.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping up the future of driving and clean transportation.
Also on our radar today: As Google's robotaxi service Waymo plans to expand to two new cities, the cars are witnessing more instances of vandalism. What is provoking these attacks? Plus, Volkswagen workers are embarking on a prolonged strike as the automaker prepares for historic plant closures in Europe.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk walked into Capitol Hill yesterday wearing a black suit and a blue tie, with his four-year-old son X Æ A-12 perched on his shoulders. As he walked into the session, reporters swarmed around him and asked questions about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk didn't respond but reacted with a disapproving side-eye.
After meeting with government officials, though, he did respond. He reiterated that the government should ""get rid of all credits."" Musk has taken on a new role as head of DOGE, an internet meme-turned-advisory body in the incoming Trump administration that will propose ways to reduce annual federal spending and streamline regulations for autonomous vehicles.
But right now, Tesla needs the credits to meet its sales goals for the year, Automotive News reports. You can lease a Tesla Model 3 or Model Y for relatively cheap. Tesla is even offering 0% financing for up to 60 months on orders placed by December 15 and those delivered by December 30. There's even a $0 downpayment financing option available—with the point-of-sale federal tax credit serving as the downpayment for qualifying buyers.
It signals that Tesla needs the federal tax credits as much as any other automaker. Musk said in October that the automaker would beat last year's 1.8 million global deliveries. After a rough couple of quarters in the start of 2024, that doesn't seem to be the case. Now, Tesla is banking on holiday lease deals and offers to get closer to that figure.
Here's more from Automotive News:
Tesla’s leasing push comes after CEO Elon Musk said in October that the automaker would beat last year’s 1.8 million global deliveries. Through the first three quarters this year, global sales fell 2.3 percent, Tesla said. In the U.S., registration data showed Tesla down 7.3 percent in the same period.
Tesla’s monthly lease penetration has fluctuated over the last two years, but the trend has been toward sharply higher rates, S&P Global Mobility said.
In January 2023, Tesla’s U.S. lease penetration was 8 percent but rose to 20 percent in December last year, the data showed. This year, Tesla’s highest lease penetration was in April at 31 percent before falling to 22 percent in July and 15 percent in September, the most recent month available, S&P Global Mobility said.
It's not just the consumer credits that help Tesla. The automaker also hugely relies on some of the Biden administration's other EV policies, like the regulatory credit scheme and even funding for EV charging. So far this year, Tesla has earned over $2.1 billion selling regulatory credits to automakers that haven't reached their emissions targets. Over 40% of Tesla's profits this year came from regulatory credit sales.
Now that other automakers are also benefitting from some of these policies, Musk wants them gone altogether? I'm no arbiter of such matters, but that doesn't sound fair.
Google parent company Alphabet's robotaxi service Waymo is operational in four U.S. cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin. These are self-driving Jaguar I-Pace electric crossovers that ferry passengers around town.
Waymo is now planning to expand to Atlanta and Miami as well. But it has to figure out how to deal with vandalism first. Social media is filled with videos of angry mobs smashing Waymos in San Francisco, lighting them up on fire and breaking their windshields. But why are people angry?
Here's an answer to that from Bloomberg:
In some sense, smashing a Waymo’s window is the latest instance in a long tradition of attacking new technology — in the style of textile-machine-smashing Luddites. In a more recent analog, protesters upset about gentrification in San Francisco in 2013 and 2014 staged elaborate stunts to blockade Google employee shuttle buses. They danced in front of them in clown suits, broke a window and in one case apparently vomited on a Yahoo bus.
Some of the rage against self-driving machines may have an obvious cause. Autonomous cars have created annoyances — endless midnight honking — and been involved in serious crashes. They also symbolize a very real threat of job displacement. And Waymos have been dealing with vandalism for years: During early testing in Arizona in 2018, people damaged the cars with knives and rocks.
Waymos are equipped with expensive lidars and a suite of cameras and sensors that help the vehicles navigate urban settings. According to Waymo's former CEO, each vehicle costs between $130,000 and $150,000. For companies aiming to mass deploy robotaxis, including Tesla and General Motors' Cruise, it looks like they may have to first figure out how to build public trust and confidence.
In case of miscreants—like some in the videos linked above seem to be—there will have to be a system in place to prevent them from harming these cars. Because that's not just a threat to the cars, but it could also be dangerous for the passengers riding in them.
Volkswagen workers in Germany will go on an extended strike next week. The German automaker is planning historic plant closures in Europe along with mass layoffs as it aims to navigate the high costs of electrification and fierce foreign competition.
The nation's largest IG Metall union representing Volkswagen workers said strikes will be in effect at nine different locations starting Monday.
""It borders on mockery when Oliver Blume stands in front of the workforce and wishes them a Merry Christmas, while at the same time, the VW board would prefer to put letters of termination under the Christmas tree for the employees,"" IG Metall negotiator Thorsten Groeger said as per a Reuters report.
The strike will coincide with the next round of discussions between the Volkswagen Group management and labor representatives as they hope to manage costs while also protecting the manufacturing jobs, which are critical to Germany's economy, especially in the auto sector.
Tesla benefitted from billions in federal funding to sustain and grow its EV and charging businesses. Now, its competitors are also taking advantage of the Biden administration's consumer and manufacturing incentives to accelerate EV adoption. Musk himself supports industry-wide electrification. “Invest in electric vehicles,"" he said in 2015. ""You won't regret it.""
Is it fair that he wants the subsidies gone after benefitting from them for years? And does playing fair even matter anymore? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Six EV SUVs Were Driven Until They Died. The Winner Was Clear,https://insideevs.com/news/743442/ev-range-test-carwow-suv/,"Mat Watson of CarWow pushed crossovers from Porsche, Polestar, Ford, Tesla, Audi and Kia to their limits.",2024-12-06 10:00:00,"We here at InsideEVs live for electric vehicle range tests, whether they’re our own evaluations or ones done by other intrepid outlets. And we know you, dear reader, love this stuff as much as we do.
In the real world, practically nobody will actually run their EV down to a 0% state of charge. You’d have to be looking for trouble to do that. But it’s fascinating to learn which models actually live up to their advertised range estimates—and which can drive the farthest when push comes to shove.
Mat Watson, of the CarWow YouTube channel, pushed six electric SUVs to their limits in a recent video, and the results are fascinating. He and his team drove the EVs across the United Kingdom until they wouldn’t go another inch. It’s so rare to pit several cars against one another under identical circumstances—the same weather, same route, same day—making this test a real treat.
Here are the contenders CarWow tested:
Let’s get something out of the way upfront. CarWow is a British channel, so all the vehicles are European-spec. And all the range estimates quoted are according to Europe’s testing standards, which are more generous than the EPA figures we’re used to in the States.
Still, we think this test is enlightening for American buyers, since most of the vehicles are available in the U.S. The Ford Explorer EV—based on the same Volkswagen platform as that brand’s ID.4—is the only one that isn’t. (America's Explorer is bigger and gas-powered.)
The European-market Ford Explorer EV.
For the range test, the CarWow team charged each SUV up to 100% and set off. They drove at the posted speed limit with the climate control set to 68 degrees, only slowing down to maximize range once the vehicle’s state of charge reached an alarmingly low level. So, basically, they tried to act like a normal driver probably would.
For all the details and a deeper dive on each vehicle, check out CarWow’s 50-minute video. Or keep reading for the results and our take on them. First, check out the final numbers, along with each vehicle's battery size and range as provided by CarWow. CarWow says it tested the longest-range version of each car, which suggests they're all the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive variants. So it's a level playing field on that front.
It’s not a shocker that no vehicle matched its range rating, since the test was done at highway speeds and that sucks more energy than city driving. Plus, few cars will ever hit their WLTP figures because that cycle is so generous. The Polestar 4—a strange Chinese crossover with no rear window—blew away the competition in terms of absolute miles driven and the percentage of its range rating it achieved. A whopping 333 miles is an excellent result, as is delivering 90% of its WLTP range.
The Porsche Macan came in second, driving nearly as far. And the two top spots make perfect sense, given that the Polestar and Porsche pack the largest battery packs at 94 kilowatt-hours and 95 kWh, respectively. Those are some beefy batteries.
Despite being the oldest and arguably stalest of the bunch, the Model Y held its own quite nicely, traveling nearly 300 miles and claiming third. That’s despite having the smallest battery pack at 75 kWh. So, just because Tesla hasn’t updated the Model Y since it came out, don’t count it out; Elon Musk’s company still makes some highly competitive and efficient cars.
2024 Porsche Macan EV.
Interestingly enough, the Ford Explorer matched the Model Y almost exactly in range and tied it in efficiency. Plus, it looks pretty darn cool. (Hey, Ford, maybe you should bring that thing to America? Think about it.)
Speaking of, what these range tests often underscore is just how absolutely crucial EV efficiency is. Big range numbers are great. But you know what’s even better? Lots of range from a modest battery pack. That’ll save you money on upfront cost, reduce energy costs over the long term and reduce your carbon footprint too.
This SUV test also highlights how much more efficient sedans are, thanks to their lower weights and slipperier shapes. CarWow did a similar test with six sedans earlier this year, and the results were way better pretty much across the board.
Tesla Model 3 Performance.
The Tesla Model 3, equipped with a 75-kWh pack, went 352 miles and notched an efficiency of 4.7 mi/kWh. The Mercedes-Benz EQE traveled a bladder-busting 357 miles. Of course, this may have had to do with the weather or road conditions on that particular day, but the body style surely has something to do with it too.

Ola’s Swappable Batteries Are The Future Of Urban Mobility,https://www.rideapart.com/news/743058/ola-electric-scooters-swappable-batteries/,"Practically speaking, this is the best path forward for two-wheeled electric urban mobility.",2024-12-25 01:25:45,"Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of experiencing what the future of urban mobility could look like while testing Can-Am's new Pulse and Origin. As fun as these bikes were, I'm not sure how I'd get on living with one, considering their conventional charging systems. Like most people who live in a city, I reside in an apartment, and charging outlets are limited.
So, although urban environments are the places where electric motorcycles with limited ranges make the most sense, for many people, they're completely unfeasible because they have nowhere to charge them.
Enter Ola Electric's new electric scooter range with swappable batteries that you can recharge inside your apartment. The all-new range consists of the Gig and the Gig+.
The base model Gig has drum brakes and is driven by a 250-watt electric motor, making it exempt from registration requirements in certain parts of the world. Unfortunately, this means it only has a top speed of around 15 mph, meaning this is realistically only an alternative for those using electric kick scooters. But there's one key difference—Range.
The single, swappable 1.5 kWh battery pack in the Gig gives it a 69-mile range, while none of the regular electric kick scooters will achieve anything close to that.
The Gig+ also stops with drum brakes but is for those who want to travel further and faster. Its 1.5 kW hub motor gives it a top speed of 28 mph, and it features a dual-battery setup. Ola claims that the Gig+ has a 50-mile range when using a single battery pack or a 97-mile range with the dual battery setup.
This isn't the first time we've seen electric motorcycles with swappable batteries, but it was an exciting concept when it was first introduced, and now that we see it catching on, it's hard to see affordable electric two-wheeled urban mobility going any other way. But there's still an issue, at least with these models.
If these scooters are to make waves in major cities across Europe and the US, they'll need to have considerably faster top speeds. As of now, Ola Electric models aren't available in the US, but here's hoping that they'll arrive soon with higher speeds.
Deliveries of the Gig and Gig+ will begin in India in April 2025.

‘Game Changer’: Honda Solid-State EVs With 620 Miles Of Range Coming This Decade,https://insideevs.com/news/743468/honda-solid-state-ev-620-miles/,"Honda claims its future EVs will even go as far as 776 miles on a full charge after 2040. There is one big issue, though.",2024-12-06 04:08:41,"Honda is kicking its solid-state battery efforts into high gear. The Japanese automaker claims the first electric vehicles fitted with its latest-gen packs would be capable of driving up to 620 miles on a full charge by the end of this decade. That's roughly double the range of today's mass-market EVs.
Besides making range anxiety a non-issue, the new solid-state batteries developed by Honda will be 50% smaller, 35% lighter and 25% cheaper to manufacture than current liquid-based lithium-ion cells. The solid electrolyte cells also promise to be much safer than what is readily available on the market today, as well as accept much higher charging speeds.
After 2040, the goals are even more ambitious. That range figure will be pushed even further to 776 miles, while the size, weight and cost will be even smaller.
More Solid-State Battery Stories
The carmaker’s executives laid all of this out during a briefing late last month in Japan. The presentation came a week after Honda announced it built a pilot production facility where it will try to figure out how to make solid-state batteries sustainably and at a mass scale. Test production will begin next month.
It all sounds excellent, and it’s undeniable that progress will be made, but Honda execs didn’t hold back on significant roadblocks that still lie ahead. The biggest issue is that the prototype battery cells the automaker is experimenting with are tiny and can’t be used in any vehicle–100 times too small, in fact.
“That’s why we have created the pilot line to identify and deal with any issues in terms of size and mass production as soon as possible,” said Takeshi Ueda, chief engineer of innovative research excellence at Honda R&D. “We have to make our prototype battery 100 times bigger. We are working on how to bring them to the mass production phase.”
Other issues are related to the production process. The ceramic separators can crack and dendrites can form in the putty-like electrolyte which can lead to a short-circuit. There’s also a climate control problem–the humidity in the facility has to be low, which usually means huge equipment that needs massive amounts of energy.
But Honda seems confident it can surpass these hurdles. For pressing the electrolyte in an even and ultracompact layer, it chose a roll-pressing technique that it says achieves thin films at fast speeds. The electrolyte slurry will be made using a continuous mixing method, which is allegedly three times faster than the batch process mixing used for conventional lithium-ion cells. To keep the humidity low, Honda chose to encapsulate each production process in its own climate-controlled area, which should help keep energy costs down because there’s no need to warm or cool a vast volume of air in a single room.
“Our all-solid-state battery will be a game changer in this EV era,” said Keiji Otsu, president of Honda R&D Co.
Honda is just one of the big players trying to turn the solid-state battery dream into reality. Toyota, Nissan, Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen all work toward the same goal, either on their own or through partnerships with third-party companies.",Iulian Dnistran
The Nissan Ariya Needs An Extra Plastic Piece To Use Tesla Superchargers (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/743323/nissan-ariya-nacs-adapter-plastic-piece/,It comes in the adapter box and stays in the charge port forever.,2024-12-06 02:04:38,"Updated with statements from Nissan.
Nissan Ariya EV owners in the United States will get access to roughly 17,800 Tesla Supercharger DC fast chargers next Tuesday. That’s a pretty big deal, and it comes as an addition to the Electrify America, the Shell Recharge branded network, ChargePoint and EVgo networks that Nissan Ariya owners in the U.S. already had access to via MyNISSAN smartphone app.
The Japanese electric crossover is just the latest to join the growing list of EVs that can use Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is widely considered one of the best in the business–if not the best.
However, what sets Nissan apart from all the other automakers that have inked deals with Tesla for Supercharger access is the design of the Ariya’s charge port. Because of the negative space between the two DC pins at the bottom of the port, Ariya owners will need to install a black piece of plastic before using an NACS to CCS adapter.
More EV Charging Stories
The T-shaped plastic bit is included in the $235 adapter box sold by Nissan, as noticed by The Verge, and owners can install it by hand and forget about it. In a statement sent to InsideEVs, Nissan said the ""adapter kit enables activation of the locking mechanism on a Tesla Supercharger to CCS port during a charging session. The plug adapter does not affect the overall functionality of the port, nor does it interfere with charging at a CCS station.""
Here’s what the Nissan Ariya’s CCS port looks like. Notice the hollow space between the two DC pins at the bottom. Next to it is the NACS to CCS adapter sold by Nissan.
The U.S.-spec Nissan Ariya has the charging port on the front-right.

And here’s what the CCS ports of the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning look like. Notice how the DC pins are separated by a solid piece of plastic.

Ford F-150 Lightning charge port
You can see how the whole thing works in Nissan’s explainer video below.
The adapter sold by Nissan looks identical to the one offered by Rivian, Ford and General Motors, but the extra plastic piece is only included in the Nissan box. Interestingly, the Ariya sold in the United Kingdom and Australia has a different design of the CCS port–it’s CCS2 instead of CCS1, but the DC pins at the bottom don’t have a hollow space between them, just a solid piece of plastic. On these right-hand drive units, the charge port is also on the left side of the vehicle, whereas U.S.-spec models have the port on the right.
The Japanese automaker added that the Ariya's CCS1 port ""was designed with a void in this area due to a different manufacturing process. However, Nissan took the additional step to modify the charge port to ensure that current Ariya customers have access to the Tesla Supercharger network.""

Battery-Swapping Nio Has Big Plans. Maybe Even For America,https://insideevs.com/news/743422/nio-usa-launch-interview/,"China's Nio plans on entering 25 more markets by the end of 2025, and it’s considering partnerships too. What about the U.S.?",2024-12-05 14:55:07,"Political pundits may denounce the presence of Chinese electric vehicles on American roads, but the fact is that they’ve already kind of been here, quietly running in the background for more than a little while now. I’m talking more substantially than say, Ford’s CEO driving a Xiaomi SU7 around the Chicagoland area, or the handful of Mexican tourists driving around South Texas their Baojuns that have been rebadged as Chevrolet products.
No, these brands have been in the U.S. in an official capacity, with offices and employees. BYD has a Pasadena, California office; it’s the place where you’ve likely seen your favorite YouTubers and TikTokers pawing through a handful of its China-only models it’s imported over for business duties. The Chinese giant has quietly moved metal in the U.S. before, like a fleet-only version of its e6 EV crossover. It’s been building and selling electric buses in the U.S. for more than a decade now. Given how much of the globe’s tech comes out of the United States, it’s kind of a no-brainer that tech-heavy Chinese EV brands would have some sort of presence here, especially in Silicon Valley.
That includes Nio, who was the subject of my most recent trip to China. The brand has had a San Jose office since at least 2015 with an on-again, off-again plan to actually sell cars in the United States.
2025 Nio ET9
When you look at Nio’s lineup in China and Europe, it seems like a no-brainer. They feel like the kinds of electric cars we’d want to buy.  Nio’s product line has more than doubled from three different models in 2018 to eight in 2024 (including a new more modestly-priced mainstream sub-brand called Onvo), with plans to launch an even cheaper mainstream brand by the end of this year.
Nio Power Swap Station
As of right now, Nio and Onvo have a range of crossovers and sedans meant to attract buyers of both mainstream and luxury EV buyers. And its signature battery-swapping technology seems like a surefire way to ease the range and charging anxiety that keeps many people from going electric.
These moves seem to have paid off. The company has grown, from about 8,000 units moved in its first year of 2018, to 190,000 units and counting for 2024. Why not grow into America next?
2023 Nio EL6 exterior front three-quarter view driving
But a world of EV development and huge geopolitical shifts have happened since Nio first opened that California office Sure, the U.S. market is arguably more ready than ever for another EV player, and Nio’s product line could be just what we’re looking for. But that’s all underscored by the fact that U.S.-China relations are at an all-time low, and just might get worse. Given the recent antagonism and shifting tide against China, are they even considering a U.S. launch anymore?
Despite it all, the answer is a definite maybe. Nio hasn’t quite counted the United States off its to-do list, but they were very clear: it probably won’t be for a while.
Like other Chinese EV manufacturers, Nio’s desire for growth, both inside and outside of China, is crucial to its survival. Thus, the brand has taken steps to grow its numbers in part by introducing new models.
But, it’s got to keep growing. Nio says that it will continue to push through Europe and other parts of Asia. “Nio will firmly explore the global markets, aiming to enter 25 countries and regions by the end of 2025, meet local user needs in different markets with its three brands and price segments, and adopt a global market strategy tailored to local conditions,” a Nio representative said in an email when asked about the brand’s future expansion plans. Ambitious, but expansion isn’t easy. Neither are the geopolitics that must be navigated or the questions surrounding sales, service, marketing and more.
Curiously, Nio also said that “[Nio] will continue to steadily implement its globalization strategy, work with partners to help facilitate technological innovation in the global smart electric vehicle industry, and provide innovative technologies, products, and services to users in more countries and regions.” The standout word in that sentence is partners.
Nio ET9 (2025)
Let’s look at its most recent market that it’s entered: Azerbaijan. Instead of entering that market itself feet first, it partnered with a distributor called Green Car to manage its sales, service, battery swap stations, and customer lounge centers, called Nio Houses. This steps around its original direct-to-consumer sales model, allowing a third party to run and manage things The partnership with Green Car is considered the start of Nio’s new strategy of entering international markets.
Nio isn’t the only brand that’s looked to outside partners to expand outside of China. Famously, Leapmotor has partnered with Stellantis as a method of entering European markets easier. The EU has recently floated the idea of a sort of reverse joint-venture relationship, where Chinese automakers partner with European ones to circumvent any import tariffs associated with Chinese EV imports.
So, what does that mean for us? Could Nio be pointing toward moving towards a partnership to enter the U.S.? Nio’s representatives sent over this statement: “The United States is one of the largest car markets in the world, and major automotive manufacturers have a strong presence there. NIO has established the team in the U.S. since the beginning of the company and has been evaluating the optimal time and strategy for its entry to the U.S. market.”
It’s not clear what form a U.S. Nio launch would take, but these are interesting statements from an interesting company, during a very interesting time in both the EV revolution and the U.S.-China relationship.

Chevrolet Equinox EV: How Much Does It Cost To Charge It?,https://insideevs.com/news/743378/chevy-equinox-ev-charging-costs/,"It costs less than half as much to ""fuel"" per mile compared to the gas-powered Equinox.",2024-12-05 13:00:07,"Chevrolet hit a home run with the Equinox EV, providing perhaps the ultimate range per dollar value on the EV market. The FWD version offers a substantial 319 miles of EV range. With the new LT trim hitting dealers, the Equinox EV FWD starts at just $33,600 — before the potential federal tax credit.
Another crucial part of the Equinox EV value equation is the fuel savings from not paying for gas. Calculating that is trickier than rattling off an EPA number. How much does it cost to charge a Chevrolet Equinox EV? The short answer is that it depends on how, where, and when you charge.
More Charging Costs
There’s one basic way to fill up a combustion car: insert a nozzle from a fuel pump. The cost is more or less the same, with some variation between stations. There are many ways to charge the battery on a Chevrolet Equinox EV, with some methods proving markedly more expensive than others. But we can use some broad numbers to get a rough baseline of how much it costs to charge an Equinox EV.
The Chevrolet Equinox EV packs 85 kWh of usable battery capacity. The national average household electricity rate is currently 16.83 cents/kWh. Charging from empty to 100 percent would cost $14.31 at that rate. A more typical 10-80% charge would cost about $10.01.
Home electricity rates vary between states. Rates vary further within states; more densely populated areas tend to have cheaper electricity. Charging an Equinox EV at home on a Level 2 charger should be the most affordable option wherever an owner resides.
How affordable charging at home is depends heavily on location. In Louisiana, with an average rate of 11.93 cents/kWh, a 10-80% charge for an Equinox EV would cost $7.10. In Connecticut, with an average rate of 33.01 cents/kWh, the same 10-80% charge would cost $19.64. Local utility companies may offer reduced metered rates for off-peak EV charging.
For many buyers, a Chevrolet Equinox EV may be their first EV. So, it’s worth noting that the installation cost for a Level 2 home charger can erode some of the savings. A popular charger like the Chargepoint Home Flex can cost more than $500. Installation by a professional electrician can cost thousands of dollars.
The Chevrolet Equinox EV is capable of 150 kW fast charging. A Level 3 DC fast charger will be the quickest, most convenient way to charge while on the road. But in most cases, it will also be a lot more expensive than charging at home — potentially more than twice the going rate for electricity during peak hours.
The Equinox EV can charge at Tesla Superchargers with a $225 adapter. Motortrend provides a rough estimate of 25-50 cents/kWh. At that rate, an Equinox EV owner would expect to pay between $14.87 and $29.75 for a full 10-80% charge. Tesla can also charge up to $1.00 per minute in idling and congestion fees.
That rate should be similar to other DC fast chargers. My closest fast charging option, an EVgo charger, averages a little above 50 cents/kWh with taxes and fees during peak daytime charging.
The Equinox EV is built on GM’s dedicated EV platform. So, there is not a true like-for-like analog in the combustion realm. But for a rough measure, we can use the the Chevy Equinox combustion crossover. According to the EPA, the Chevy Equinox FWD earns 28 mpg combined. It requires 3.6 gallons of fuel to travel 100 miles. The EPA estimates the Equinox EV FWD needs 31 kWh to travel 100 miles.
As of this writing, the national average price for a gallon of gas is $3.04. At that rate, driving an Equinox FWD 100 miles costs $10.94. At the national household electricity rate of 16.38 cents/kWh, it would cost $5.21 to drive an Equinox EV — less than half as much. But that price could jump to between $7.75 and $15.50 if charging an Equinox EV via DC fast charging, approaching or even exceeding the cost of gasoline.",Ty Duffy
"EV Dirt Bike Brand Niu Won't Make You Endure A Dealership, Thank God",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742944/niu-electric-dirt-bike-xqi3-direct-to-consumer-dealership/,"Good, because haggling is my least favorite thing to do.",2024-12-25 01:25:47,"I really loved my time with NIU's XQi3. In fact, my kids were pretty saddened when it was time for the street-legal electric dirt bike to go back to the company. I'm pretty sure one actually cried while saying, ""No more wheelies!""
But despite the favorable review I gave it, as well as the testimonial my children relayed, I found one aspect of NIU's world domination plan to be suspect: the EVs were sold through existing dealerships, not directly to consumers.
Now, I get the reasoning behind doing it that way, as dealerships get foot traffic and the lower-than-average selling price of the XQi3s likely would attract potential customer eyeballs and cash. But dealerships, even powersport dealerships who've been slightly better in terms of adapting to the EV way of the future, aren't always the best place to sell EVs. Likewise, I and countless others have never had what I'd call a ""good"" dealership experience. Doesn't matter if it's me buying a car, truck, or powersport thing, there's always an air of ""I'm gonna somehow screw you"" coming from the salesperson in front of me.
And most folks agree with that sentiment, as a 2016 study found that 87% of consumers particularly dislike the dealership experience.
That's why when NIU stated the company would start selling its offerings directly to consumers, as well as keep its traditional dealership partners, I was pretty stoked about its future.
According to the company, customers can now purchase an XQi3 through the NIU Moto Sales Platform (NMSP) across the US, allowing them to ""shop, finance and finalize their XQi3 purchase entirely online."" From there, the NMSP does all the tax, title, and registering (for those wishing to make their bikes street-legal), as well as offering up financing options, too. Niu states that ""Once purchased, the dirt bikes are shipped directly to customers or to a nearby dealer for final assembly and delivery.""
So there's still a dealership network available to you for maintenance and repair, you just don't have to use them to purchase your motorcycle.
""The launch of the NIU Moto Sales Platform is a milestone not only for our company but for the EV industry as a whole,"" said Ben McGill, Niu's head of North America Operations, adding, ""E-commerce has transformed countless industries, and we believe it’s time for motor vehicles to embrace this innovation. Our platform ensures that no matter where you live, you can be part of the EV revolution—even if local retailers and dealers haven’t yet adapted to this shift.""
For those who do like to haggle, NIU isn't giving up on its dealerships, though. The brand states that its growing dealership network, which now totals over 100, including its two flagship stores in San Diego and Miami, will ""[empower] dealers to expand their customer base while providing seamless access to NIU’s cutting-edge products.""
As for the bike in question, NIU recently slashed both of the prices for the XQi3 Wild and Street by $1,000, each commanding an incredibly reasonable $3,999. NIU also did an OTA update that apparently upgrades the bikes' performance pretty drastically, though I've yet to test it out—you've got my number, NIU. But overall, it's good news from NIU and good news for folks who loathe going to the dealership.

Ford EV Sales Reach New Monthly Record In November,https://insideevs.com/news/743395/ford-ev-sales-set-a-new-monthly-record/,Ford sold a record number of Mustang Mach-Es and F-150 Lightnings in November.,2024-12-05 12:00:03,"Ford sold a record number of electric vehicles in the third quarter. Now, it's carrying that momentum in the final quarter and is on track to finish the year strong for its EVs and hybrids.
The automaker's electrified vehicle sales, which includes hybrids, EVs and PHEVs, totaled 257,693 units in the first 11 months of this year. November EV sales stood at 10,821 units, a 21% increase compared to last November, thanks to relatively strong demand for the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit.
Customers drove 5,983 electric Mustangs home, marking its best-ever monthly sales, which also happens to be 39% more than the same period last year. Nearly 45,000 units of the Mustang Mach-E have been sold so far this year in the U.S. It only trails the Tesla Model Y, making it the second best-selling electric SUV in the first 11 months of 2024.
The Mach-E was introduced as a 2021 model year car. Despite being around for so long, it continues to bring home results for Ford.
For 2025, the electric crossover is an even better deal. The 2025 Mustang Mach-E will be among the cheapest crossovers on the market with a starting price of $36,495 before destination. It now gets new features like a heat pump for better battery efficiency and range in the winter and automatic lane changes on the latest BlueCruise version.
The E-Transit van has also been racking up record sales numbers. Ford said its sales volumes are already up four times this year compared to last year and it's America's best-selling electric van. So far this year, Ford has sold 11,584 E-Transits, whereas November sales reached 1,240 units.
While the F-150 Lightning may have conceded its best-selling electric truck crown to the Tesla Cybertruck in the third quarter, it continues to do well by its own measure. Ford sold a record 3,643 F-150 Lightnings in November, a 1.7% increase over last year. Through November, Ford sold 28,313 units of the electric truck, up 39% compared to the same period last year.
However, the sales figures of the fully electric models pale compared to the hybrids. The Maverick and F-150 hybrids continue to be volume sellers and profit drivers for the brand. The automaker has sold a whopping 133,983 hybrid trucks so far this year; that includes 67,666 F-150 hybrids and 66,272 Maverick hybrids.
All said competition is truly heating up in the EV space. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 now comes with a factory-fitted NACS port for seamless access to Tesla Superchargers. The Honda Prologue is quickly becoming one of America's favorite EVs and General Motors now offers the largest EV portfolio of all brands, with the Chevy Equinox EV spearheading that offensive.
Even though uncertainty looms over the discontinuation of the federal EV tax credits under the incoming Trump administration, one thing is clear: 2025 will bring consumers more choices and better EVs than ever before.

The EV Industry Is Gearing Up To Fight Donald Trump,https://insideevs.com/news/743292/trump-us-ev-industry-fight/,"Plus, Waymo's ridership has gone way, way up, and things are going very, very bad for GM in China.",2024-12-05 10:44:05,"The auto industry is at a weird place right now: after years of pushing back against tougher regulations driving electric vehicles, the car business in America has finally leaned in, only for the incoming presidential administration to potentially pull EV tax credits away. But the industry needs that money flowing to fund this transition, and now it's starting to fight back.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about the auto industry's plea to keep the EV tax credits, Waymo's way-up ridership, and GM's grim outlook for China. Let's jump in.
President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration has been clear about how they stand on EV subsidies: get rid of 'em. That means ditching the $7,500 tax credit, production credits for critical factories, and any federal mandates, existing or not. Never fear, though, because the industry believes that the EV revolution is here to stay whether or not these subsidies disappear—the question is just how effectively, efficiently, and quickly the market is penetrated by battery-powered cars.
That being said, the industry isn't going down without a fight. Automakers, battery manufacturers, and key component suppliers are gearing up to ensure that the transition continues at full steam, or at least as closely as it can given the circumstances.
If you recall, one of Trump's campaign promises was to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act on his first day in office, as well as cut any rules that force automakers to meet an electrified sales goal of two-thirds of their fleet by 2032. Since the election, Trump hasn't spoken publicly on this promise.
Recently, The Information asked the Trump campaign about the status of his plans: are those items still on the chopping block? According to a campaign spokesperson, the incoming president will “Support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars and electric vehicles""—which reads as an inconclusive nothing-burger that has industry lobbying groups like the Alliance for Automotive Innovation a bit riled up.
Shortly after the election, the Alliance's president and CEO, John Bozella, wrote to Trump, urging him to ""preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code"" as they relate to ""next-generation automotive technologies, including EVs."" And that kind of lobbying is about all the industry can do right about now, especially when the first day of the Trump presidency—when those cuts were promised—is coming up very quickly.
The Alliance has since hosted a conference in Washington D.C. In attendance were auto, battery, and mining executives who passively pleaded to retain the existing credit. In fact, the National Mining Association even stressed the need to increase the existing subsidies to include the mining industry, since many of the precious ingredients in an EV battery actually need to be mined and refined in order to be turned into those sweet, sweet batteries.
Industry players also recognized that, despite the credit being in effect, EV adoption has slowed. However, they also noted that the IRA has rapidly fueled domestic investments into manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs—$123 billion since 2018 (including $90 billion in battery factories and $33 billion in EV plants, according to the report from The Information).
So while the U.S. EV adoption rate still currently sits around 10%, it's growing fast. Companies have already made vast investments into growing the EV industry, but that doesn't mean that adoption will happen without continued support and regulation. It's one of the ways that China was able to reach the major threshold of half of its new car sales being electrified (either BEV or hybrid) earlier this year.
And if the U.S. kills EV subsidies, it risks falling even further behind China's EV industry during one of the most critical times in the transition.
Waymo's robotaxis are on quite the roll. After opening up paid rides to the general public just 90 days ago, the Alphabet-backed company more than doubled its number of passengers (also called ""ridership"") in California.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Waymo hit just a hair under a half-million passengers in August, up from 204,000 passengers in May 2024 and 292,000 in June. This means Waymo managed an uptick of a whopping 295,000 passengers since May—quite the feat for the driverless ride-hailing service. Those passengers managed to log a total of 312,000 paid rides, which is more than double the number achieved at the end of Q2 (May).
So why the sudden uptick? Well, that's hard to say. Even Waymo can't attribute the reasoning to one single event. However, the company's recent expansion into Los Angeles almost certainly helped pad the numbers. And to sprinkle some more success into the mix, Waymo has also been steadily increasing the number of vehicles on the road in California and other markets like Phoenix.
Some quick napkin math from data collected by the California Public Utilities Commission shows that Waymo had around 479 vehicles in service in August, which means that each car serviced around 651 rides per month. For those keeping up, that's about one ride every 55 or so minutes. Not too shabby.
Riders are also increasingly interested in driverless cars. Some people want to try them out for sheer curiosity—I mean, it's kind of cool to be in a car and have nobody behind the wheel, right? Other folks say that Waymo's rides are typically cost-competitive when compared with ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, though not always. However, some people are willing to pay a premium just to not have to make small talk with a stranger who just happens to be chauffeuring them around. The inner introvert in me loves that for them. Plus, there's no tipping a robot (yet.)
Of course, the ride has come with some bumps. Just like ridership is up, so are crashes. Waymo reported 55 collisions during Q3, which might not seem like much, but that's also double the number of crashes that occurred in Q2 (27), which doubled the number in Q1 (13). This figure appears to be very linear with the number of rides and total miles traveled.
Also, Waymo is coming to Miami next, CNBC reports. Florida Man is going autonomous, folks. Get excited.
Yesterday, we covered General Motors' $5 billion gut punch in China. Now, the whole Western auto industry is wondering if it still has a future in the world's biggest car market. Bloomberg explains exactly what's at risk:
Once a linchpin of GM’s global strategy, the company’s China business is in free fall. The automaker hasn’t given many details of its plans but the partners are looking at difficult options that will shrink its presence. The joint venture will likely cull workers and shutter plants, according to people familiar with the matter. GM is looking at axing specific models, turning brands like Buick—once the preferred car of the Chinese emperor in the 1920s—from a household name into a minor player.
Those decisions will have huge implications for GM’s willingness to stay in China beyond 2027, when its [deal with joint venture partner] SAIC expires. The company said it has no plans to leave and that the planned cutbacks will do the trick, but it will have to assess how long it can tough it out amid price wars.
GM is struggling to compete on price with domestic models subsidized by the Chinese government and could eventually leave the venture if losses persist, people familiar with the matter said. And if SAIC is no longer getting cutting-edge technology or a brand bump from working with a well-known American manufacturer, it may have a reason to walk away, the people said.
Affordable brands like BYD, Nio, and newcomer Xiaomi have begun flooding the local market. These aren't just cheap cars or clones of well-known American brands. No, they're actually extremely attractive EVs that stand on their own merits. Not only are they cheap, but they're packed full of tech and have enough range where buying anything offered by U.S. or European automakers seems silly at best.
Mike Dunne, a former GM exec and expert on the car market in China, says that the country is done with global carmakers. The country has collectively made up its mind and is flocking toward the home teams—even EV powerhouses like Tesla are feeling the heat.
“We’ve seen a collapse of market share and profits all at once and the established carmakers are powerless to stop it,"" Dunne said.
You can see why American automakers are sweating over the potential influx of affordable Chinese EVs in North America. And if tariffs aren't enough to protect domestic automakers from the tech prowess that overseas EVs appear to have, there's going to be trouble in Detroit.
China's car market is arguably the most competitive in the world and GM is feeling the same squeeze that just about every foreign automaker in China is feeling right now. There are more than 100 competing brands, many of which are staying nimble and innovative so they stand a chance at standing out in the crowded EV market. If GM wants to compete, it needs to rethink its strategy.
And this $5 billion reset could help it do that—well, combined with other efforts that it's trying to tackle stateside like tailor-fitting a new breed of batteries to its brand. But if GM doesn't succeed, or geopolitical tensions make selling its cars a burden, the General's future in China could be at risk.
You know, I found it interesting that some folks expect to pay more for a ride in a Waymo or other autonomous vehicle.
The entire idea of a driverless car is to make the long-term operating costs cheaper. When you don't have someone behind the wheel, you (ideally) reduce risk and have a robot essentially working for you 24x7 with no need for rest, sick days, or benefits. It's a capitalist market's dream. Sure, there are more upfront costs, but long term, there are projected cost reductions. Wouldn't you expect the ride to be cheaper?
Then again, others are happy to pay more to not have to deal with a better and more predictable experience. Whether it be Uber, Lyft, or a local taxi company, you never really know what you're walking into.
So now it's your turn: would you be willing to pay a premium to ride in an AV? Why or why not? Let me know in the comments.

EV Reliability Improved In 2024. It Still Lags Behind Hybrids And ICE,https://insideevs.com/news/743394/consumer-reports-reliability-survey-evs/,"Plug-in hybrids still fare the worst when it comes to reliability, although they too are improving.",2024-12-05 10:21:32,"Good news for anyone considering going electric: the latest Consumer Reports reliability survey shows that EVs made in the last three model years are improving compared to older models. CR compared data about vehicles with all levels of electrification and found that hybrids are more reliable than pure combustion cars, which are better than electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
This CR survey gathered data from around 300,000 2022 through 2024 model-year vehicles and says it got more responses than ever from hybrid and plug-in hybrid owners, showing these models’ growing popularity.
PHEVs still fared badly against combustion cars with 70% more problems than cars with no form of electrification. It’s still a massive improvement over last year when PHEVs had 146% more problems than ICE, but they are still more problematic.
EVs also improved to 42% more problems than ICE from 79% a year ago. CR still says non-plug-in hybrids are about as reliable as pure combustion cars, but it no longer gives a percentage.
Last year it rated hybrid reliability as being 26% better than ICE. This year it just says “many hybrids stand out as the most reliable vehicles you can buy, and our survey data shows that hybrids, as a category, are as reliable as non-hybrid gas cars.” CR also notes that not all hybrids are reliable, pointing to the Ford F-150 hybrid and Volkswagen ID.4 as being among the least reliable in the survey.
But while EV reliability went up, it’s still dragged down by several cars built by inexperienced startup companies. CR’s data points to the fact that the Lucid Air may be the least reliable sedan, but it’s insufficient for a clear picture. It does have enough data for Rivian, though, and it came in last for general brand reliability.
The most reliable EV was the BMW i4, but most EVs (including the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y) showed average reliability while the Model S and Model X rated below average. The Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV are also having issues, with CR noting that “many owners also complained about the EV battery, electrical accessories, climate system, and in-car electronics.”
More On EV Reliability
Some cars, like the BMW iX, Audi Q8 E-Tron and Kia EV6, even lost their CR recommendations due to reliability concerns. Production of the Audi will stop sooner than initially planned, and you probably won’t be able to buy one new after the middle of next year.
Even though CR says plug-in hybrids are generally more problematic, it does recommend the Volvo XC60 PHEV and the Toyota RAV4 Prime. The latter is, in fact, the most reliable vehicle in this year’s survey. The Mazda CX-90 PHEV may still need a few bugs ironed out, as it was rated the least reliable three-row SUV.
Steven Elek, who runs the auto data program at CR, explains that for EVs, it’s not just drivetrain, battery and charging problems that are lowering the score. He says “EVs are often a test bed for new technology, so there are more electrical accessory and in-car electronics issues as well.” This seems like an unstoppable trend that is slowly turning automakers into tech companies whose interest seems to be shifting toward producing the best ""smartphone on wheels.""",Andrei Nedelea
Rivian's Fancy New Charging Outposts Will Be Open To All EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743379/rivian-adventure-network-joshua-tree/,"The new Rivian Adventure Network sites will work with CCS and NACS EVs, and they're powered by 100% renewable energy too.",2024-12-05 09:00:52,"Charging your electric vehicle at home is great and all, but have you ever tried doing it at a closed car dealership at 10 p.m. when it's raining outside and you're basically out of luck if you need to use the bathroom? Yeah, I'm not a fan of that experience either.
The good news is that Rivian is the latest company to unveil some very common-sense updates to the charging experience, and the first example of this opens to the public today. Even better, more Rivian Charging Outposts like this are coming soon and they'll be open to all EVs.
Today, the EV startup announced the launch of its new Joshua Tree Charging Outpost in California. You may recognize the vibe here: the first Charging Outpost opened earlier this year at a converted gas station near Yosemite National Park. Unlike, say, the off-highway strip mall you've been frequenting for your fast-charging needs, the Rivian site boasts an on-site library, a trail mix bar, a lounge to relax in and, best of all, 24-hour restrooms.
The same approach is coming to Joshua Tree now but this one's even more of an upgrade because it's the first such site that will be open to all EVs and not just Rivian's R1S and R1T.
Rivian Adventure Network, Joshua Tree
""Using a new charger design to accommodate any compatible EV in North America, these sites are an important milestone in support of electrifying the entire transportation sector,"" Rivian officials said in a news release. ""Strategically located to encourage more people to drive electric on their next adventure, these chargers will deliver rapid charging up to 900 volts and feature CCS connectors with support for North American Charging Standard (NACS)-equipped vehicles with an automaker-approved adapter.""
A future hardware update will also allow these stations to support EVs with a native NACS plug, like the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 and eventually Rivian's own R2 and R3 models. As an added bonus, these charging stations will support ""tap-to-pay"" displays so you can charge up without having to install the Rivian app. They'll also be powered by 100% renewable energy, the company said, countering a frequent criticism that EVs get their energy from fossil-fuel sources. That's quickly changing as the grid evolves, but Rivian's getting ahead of it now.
""To achieve widespread electrification, you also need a really good charging network,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""Now, we’re excited to bring the Rivian Adventure Network—with its ease of use and exceptional reliability—to other EV drivers around North America, investing in a future where charging on the road will be simple, sustainable, and convenient.""
There's also good news if you, unfortunately, do not live within the vicinity of Joshua Tree. Rivian said that more fast-charging sites are coming online this year—yes, as in the remaining weeks of 2024—in Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York.
Rivian isn't the first company to try and expand the public EV charging experience beyond the fairly dismal experience many drivers currently deal with. While charging at home is the best way to drive electric, for those who cannot or are on road trips, getting juice out in public often means a hodgepodge of smartphone payment apps, inconvenient locations, long lines and nowhere to get snacks or use the facilities.
But this is changing quickly and evolving into a model that's a bit more like a gas station. Ionna, the charging conglomerate funded by several automakers, has a new family of sites coming soon that boasts retail options and restrooms too. The Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging network is offering similar amenities, and while Mercedes owners get certain perks, those sites are open to all EV drivers as well.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",2024-12-25 01:25:50,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

Now, that number has doubled.",2024-12-05 08:21:19,"General Motors and charging network operator EVgo have installed their 2,000th co-branded electric vehicle fast charging stall in the United States.
The milestone-setting dispenser is part of a new charging station that went online recently in Murrieta, California. It’s located off Interstate 215 in Riverside County and has a total of five 350-kilowatt dispensers that can recharge up to 10 EVs at the same time. If just one EV is connected to a stall, it can benefit from its full power potential, but if two EVs share a dispenser, the power will be split between them.
Last year, the two companies announced that their 1,000th DC fast-charging stall went online. It took them a year and four months to double that figure.

GM and EVgo’s collaboration resulted in public DC fast charging stations for electric vehicles in over 390 locations in 45 metropolitan areas across 32 states. Their co-branded stalls can be found near grocery stores, retail complexes and city centers.
That said, there’s still work to be done. The two entities said they’re on their way toward building a total of 2,850 EV fast charging stalls nationwide, including 400 fast chargers at flagship locations across metropolitan markets including in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, New York and Texas. Most of these will have up to 20 stalls, generous lighting, canopies and amenities.
“Our collaboration with EVgo underscores our dedication to providing EV drivers with the best possible experience by expanding reliable fast charging infrastructure across the country,” said Wade Sheffer, Vice President, GM Energy. “We look forward to continuing to offer premium charging experiences for years to come.”
In total, EVgo has over 1,000 EV fast charging stations and over 3,600 ports across the country, according to the Department of Energy, making it one of the largest public fast charging operators in the United States.",Iulian Dnistran
"Nissan EV Drivers Are About To Get Supercharger Access, With A Big Exception",https://insideevs.com/news/743289/nissan-ariya-supercharger-access/,Owners of Nissan's latest long-range EV will have better charging access starting next week. But a larger group is getting left behind.,2024-12-04 17:30:28,"Nissan Ariya drivers will get access to over 17,000 Tesla Superchargers next week, the automaker announced Tuesday. Unfortunately, the Nissan Leaf and its outdated CHAdeMO plug will be left behind as the automaker transitions to supporting the North American Charging System (NACS) popularized by Tesla.
Ariya will need an adapter to charge at Tesla Superchargers, like all Combined Charging Standard (CCS) cars that can use the network. The adapter costs $235 and is available for order today via a Nissan dealer or Nissanusa.com (don't ask about Nissan.com). The Supercharger network will open up to Ariyas next Tuesday, December 10. There are no plans to open it up to Nissan Leafs.
I recommend getting your order placed quickly, as adapter supply issues have stunted many automakers' Supercharger access rollout. While Ford and Rivian owners have been able to plug into Superchargers since the spring, some are still waiting on adapters. Recalls haven't helped. General Motors EVs got access to America's largest and most reliable network back in September, and its rollout seems to have gone a bit smoother. I had no trouble getting an adapter for my own Blazer EV.
Related Stories
There's reason to be optimistic that Nissan's will go even better. The Ariya just isn't that popular, which means owners will have less competition for supply-limited adapters. Unlike Ford and Rivian, Nissan, like GM, is also charging for its adapters. That'll prevent people from snagging one on a whim, and so I wouldn't expect many delays.
Yet the whole rollout itself was delayed. Tesla fired its Supercharger team back in the spring, and despite rehiring some the shakeup still slowed the rollout. The company produces most of the CCS to NACS adapters offered by other automakers, and GM had to get secondary suppliers to make sure they had enough. GM's rollout was supposed to come in spring, too, but was delayed until full. So was Polestar and Volvo's rollout. Nissan comes next, with Hyundai, Kia, VW, BMW, Mercedes and others still to come.
Many of those owners still don't know when they'll be able to use Tesla Superchargers. But if you're a Nissan Ariya driver, your time has come. Finding reliable charging will get a whole lot easier starting next Tuesday.

Some developers are potentially looking down the barrel of invoices with multi-million dollar figures on the bottom line—and it's going to screw over not just the engineers building the software that many drivers know and love, but also the people who the software every single day.
Before we jump into things, let's talk about what an API actually is. Essentially, it's a software bridge that enables two programs to talk with one another in very specific ways. Think of it like a dinner menu for software: it tells you what you can eat without letting you actually poke around in the kitchen while also telling you how to order the food (think: the names of food items on the menu, and restaurant policies like ""no substitutions"").
In the Tesla world, APIs create a tunnel between the outside world and your car. If you have the keys, you can give them to a third-party app to authorize it to do common and complex vehicle tasks like open your trunk, document your mileage, or perform automated controls like pre-heating your car's battery at a certain time before you leave for work every day.
Tons of third-party apps have been built on Tesla's API. And there's a good reason for it, too. Tesla's native phone app is great for basic functions, but it lacks more advanced controls for power users, or people who want to go above and beyond what the Tesla app allows folks to access. Tessie, one of the most popular, provides insight on battery health and charging cost projections, and up until this week, was one of the only ways to put Tesla controls on your wrist with a wearable.
Tesla's user-facing API has been undocumented for more than a decade—that is, until, Tesla officially released documentation on how to use the API last October. Until then, it was a community effort that began in 2013 and just kind of worked, unofficially.
Last week, Tesla officially unveiled its pay-per-use pricing for its API. These are the costs that developers will need to pay per vehicle to access data and perform actions for vehicles on its app. And, folks, things aren't looking great if you use one of the dozens of third-party Tesla apps out there that will be affected in just a matter of weeks.
""I'll owe Tesla around $60 million per year using current rates,"" wrote James Gragg, the founding developer of the popular Tesla app, Tessie, on Reddit.
Gragg told InsideEVs that Tessie has been planning on adapting to the API changes for more than a year, so it's not something that the dev hasn't planned for. However, the abrupt change and sky-high pricing make it clear the direction that Gragg and many other devs will have to go if they want to keep their apps active in the Tesla ecosystem.
""[W]e'll need to move off of Tesla's web API and to direct car communication [over IP and Bluetooth Low Energy]. Tesla has recently introduced firmware improvements which will allow this. It's not on all cars yet but hopefully will be within the next few months. Since those are low/no-cost methods, hopefully, I can migrate everyone with little to no impact on functionality or price. That's the best-case scenario that I'm shooting for,"" continued Gragg. ""There is a wild amount of effort required, but I'm dead set on making it work.""
Effectively, this means removing the real-time access to date from Tesla's always-connected cloud and instead requiring proximity-based connection to the car. For local IP connection, this means being on the same wireless network, and Bluetooth Low Energy requires that the driver's phone be physically within reach of the vehicle.
Of course, not all apps will go down this road. As Gragg mentioned, the change takes ""a wild amount of effort"" to make it work. However, if the only alternatives are millions of dollars in API fees or a non-functional app, it seems that developers will have a tough choice to make sooner rather than later.
""The new API pricing from Tesla came as a shock to the community. Tesla did announce a transition to a paid model at the end of 2023, but the new pricing model is quite prohibitive. In most cases, it would require developers to pay thousands of dollars per day to Tesla, whereas developers make only a fraction of that amount,"" said Ramin Nasibov, developer of the Stats App for Tesla, in an email to InsideEVs.
""Most third-party developers are individual, independent developers (I am). There are tens of thousands of Tesla car owners who have come to rely on these third-party apps, which provide the users with features that complement the official Tesla app. We really hope that Tesla reconsiders the API pricing model so that we can continue serving our users.""
In case this cash grab sounds familiar, recall that X—or Twitter, as it was once better known as—did the exact same thing once it came under the ownership of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. This effectively erased some of the most popular third-party Twitter apps from the face of the earth that couldn't afford monthly bills in the tens of thousands of dollars because of API requests made to the platform.
Reddit soon followed suit. CEO Steve Huffman said that he was inspired by Musk's strategic move to ratchet up API prices and did the exact same thing to Reddit's API. Unsurprisingly, popular apps like Apollo bit the dust, at least officially.
This has led to the internet lashing back against the platforms because of the change in user experience. For Reddit, moving from the Apollo app to the official Reddit app meant more ads, less functionality, and more power consumption. For Twitter, apps like Tweetbot were killed, which also meant a less pleasurable experience for users who were instead forced to Twitter's—sorry, X's—native app.
With Tesla pulling the same strings as X and Reddit, it's likely that we'll see the exact same thing happen. Sure, there's the risk of paid apps getting kneecapped, but also a much higher hit to the usability of free apps like A Better Route Planner:
""The Tesla data streaming is a technically good solution that enables really good real-time data for users. The pricing for this data method and the way we use it in ABRP would become $4-5 per vehicle and month, which is not possible for us to sustain as a free service to the users,"" Bo Lincoln, founder of the app A Better Route Planner (now owned by Rivian), told InsideEVs. ""Even with ABRP Premium ($5/month), which is what we typically require for paid telemetry solutions, it would not cover our costs.""
Lincoln explained that ABRP would need to drop Tesla connectivity from ABRP's free user-facing mapping service due to the API charges. And even if users purchased a premium subscription, the live data would need to limit the quality and frequency of the data pulled in order to ensure that its API bill is manageable.
From a user perspective, this is kind of frustrating. Tesla opening up its API last year finally acknowledged the innovation that third-party developers can bring to Tesla's already software-rich ecosystem. Hell, it's even been rumored that the automaker has considered an in-car app store. But financially walling off developers from control of cars is a move that owners should be riled up about.
Tesla shows that it's planning to give folks a $10 credit for personal API use. Perhaps some apps can allow users to input their own API key to use the software to offload the cost from the developer and still maintain functionality. But the ease of seamless click-and-go integration appears to be over, at least without a huge uptick in price.

Would You Turn Your Classic Mazda Miata Into An EV With This Kit?,https://insideevs.com/news/743271/mazda-miata-mx5-ev-conversion/,This EV conversion kit will elevate the NA Miata’s performance considerably while still keeping the car light.,2024-12-04 16:00:08,"Electrogenic is a company specializing in “drop-in” EV conversion for classic cars and it just announced a kit for the first-generation Mazda Miata built between 1989 and 1997. The U.K.-based firm (one of many) also offers kits for the Jaguar E-Type, Land Rover Defender, Rolls-Royce Phantom, DeLorean, classic Mini and Porsche 911.
The plug-and-play kit for the NA Miata features a 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which sits in the engine bay and gives the car a real-world range of 150 miles (241 kilometers). A full charge takes about one hour. Having the battery pack in place of the engine is a great use of space, and it keeps the trunk free to carry some cargo. However, it also helps preserve the car’s weight distribution and handling balance.
The battery pack does make the MX-5 heavier by around 220 pounds (100 kilograms), but that still only means the car weighs about 2,650 pounds (1,200 kg).
With 160 horsepower and 229 pound-feet (310 Nm) of torque from the electric motor, the power-to-weight ratio is improved by 21% over the original, whose engines never made more than 130 horsepower. With the 130 hp 1.8-liter, an NA could accelerate to 60 mph from a standstill in about eight seconds and Electrogenic says its EV swap will drop that by about two seconds. The top speed is 115 mph (185 km/h), about the same as the original.
While some conversions keep the car’s original transmission and still allow you to shift gears, this kit has a single fixed ratio. For Miata enthusiasts, rowing their own is one of the highlights of the driving experience, so taking away the shifter will also take something away. However, the fact that the car is still so light, even as an EV, should ensure that the legendary Miata handling persists.
Having so much more torque than the original in such a light car should provide a different kind of fun. You should be able to slide the tail around more in the EV conversion and thanks to electric motors’ instant torque delivery, you should have a lot of control under your right foot.
Steve Drummond, Electrogenic CEO, said about the kit: “We’ve long been intrigued by the concept of a light, well-balanced, rear-wheel-drive electrified modern-classic, one that truly delivers when it comes to the old-school thrill of driving. It seems we weren’t alone, as we’ve received a great deal of interest in the idea of an MX-5 conversion over the years. It’s exciting to finally reveal our creation to the world and give MX-5 fans the chance to electrify one of the most popular sports cars in history.”
To answer the question in the title, you probably don’t want to turn your classic Miata into an EV. However, if that’s the only way you’ll still be allowed to drive one in the future, well, an electric Miata is better than no Miata at all, especially since Mazda is still unclear on the formula an electrified Miata should have.

Effortless 'Plug And Charge' Is Coming For All EVs Soon,https://insideevs.com/news/743273/effortless-plug-and-charge-protocol-for-evs/,A universal electric vehicle charging protocol will make the EV ownership experience a whole lot easier.,2024-12-04 15:30:39,"Charging a non-Tesla electric car isn't as straightforward as it should be. There are half a dozen charging apps on my phone to authenticate and initiate charging at different stations. Even then, I have to often contort to awkward angles at charging stations, over dangling cables, to glance at poorly lit screens on the dispensers to check the charging status. If you drive an EV you've likely had a similar experience. It's a real pain sometimes.
But the charging experience could soon improve with a new nationwide framework in the U.S. that aims to establish a simple ""plug and charge"" method for all electric cars, regardless of the brand. If it goes into effect, charging could be as simple as pumping gas; just pull up and plug-in.
Currently, automakers and charging companies use their own authentication systems. Principally, it's all the same: when you plug in an EV, there's a ""handshake"" between the car and the charger; a process where the two communicate to ensure a safe connection before charging begins.
But this doesn't always work seamlessly and EV owners have to navigate a number of steps before the actual charging begins. Now that's set to change.
The Society Of Automotive Engineers along with a consortium of carmakers and charging companies and the U.S. Government's Joint Office of Energy and Transportation announced a common framework on Wednesday to enable drivers to plug in and charge at all public charging stations, without having to download apps or fiddle with payment systems.
SAE will establish what's called ""Certificate Trust List Requirements,"" which is basically a rulebook for automakers, charging companies and equipment suppliers who will have to meet certain technical and safety standards for plug and charge. Suppliers who meet these standards can apply to be approved for deployment of plug and charge to their networks.
“Today’s announcement focuses the industry on interoperability and security,” said Sarah Hipel, Chief Technology Officer of Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. Several major charging companies and automakers, including Tesla, Electrify America, ChargePoint, General Motors, Ford and Toyota are already part of this consortium and more are expected to join in the coming months and years.
If it's rolled out as promised, EV drivers will simply have to pull up to charging stations, plug-in and walk away. The network would handle the whole ""handshake"" and process payments seamlessly. This would reduce the time spent at charging stations and also ease some of the charging anxiety that's slowing down the mass adoption of EVs.
“We are rapidly approaching a future where every EV driver can just plug in, charge up, and go; the network will talk to your car and process the payment seamlessly,"" said Gabe Klein, Executive Director of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. ""This is a fundamental step in architecture toward enabling bidirectional charging and true vehicle-to-grid integration, the holy grail for energy and transportation.”
Testing of this universal protocol begins in 2025 and availability for the public could take longer than that. Either ways, it's a positive step forward that could make the EV ownership experience a whole lot easier in the next couple of years.

The Pope's New Ride Is This Electric G-Class,https://insideevs.com/news/743265/mercedes-electric-popemobile/,Mercedes just gave the Pope a new set of all-electric wheels.,2024-12-04 15:00:20,"Mercedes has unveiled the latest version of the Pope's open-air transportation, lovingly called the ""Popemobile."" The 2024 edition has gone electric, with a cut-roof design based on the awfully named ""G 580 with EQ technology."" Or, as everyone else calls it, the electric G.
Mercedes has a long history of furnishing His Holy Father's whips. Because the Pope's duties involve a lot of crowdwork, the Bishop of Rome has long traveled in an open-air car that allows him to greet, bless and interact with worshippers. Though a plexiglass-enclosed version was later used, people mistakenly assume that was a bulletproof setup for the Pope's protection. They're half right. According to plaques next to it at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany, the enclosed Popemobile was designed to protect the Pope. Not from gunmen, though, but from wind and rain.
The new edition has a removable top that covers the front and top of the Pope's seat from the elements. But the sides and rear appear to be open-air, a nice sign of the Pope's openness to his followers. Pope Francis will sit in a large white plush chair, which should allow him to do some 360-degree hand-waving. As per tradition, the seat and the vehicle are a brilliant shade of white.
The all-electric powertrain will help, too, as the first all-electric Mercedes Popemobile is sure to be quieter than any internal-combustion G. (Note that Fisker, of all companies, beat Mercedes to the punch on offering an electric Popemobile ""design."") It also allows him to travel emissions free, a good perk when you represent a Church that aims to protect the Earth and its people. Mercedes says the powertrain has been specially configured for the low-speed driving the Pope does, but offers no more details on powertrain changes. I'll assume, then, that the Pope's driver has access to 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque, more than you need when your main passenger is in an unrestrained swivel chair, outside and, notably, 87. No wonder Mercedes tuned it for more low-speed operation.
The G 580 also comes with a 116-kWh battery. Considering the low speeds, I expect the Pope's hand will get tired long before his car does. And with a 10-80% charge time of just 32 minutes, the electric Popemobile should be capable of a quick turnaround.
Here's it without the rain cover.
Clearly, this is a great use case for an EV, and it's awesome to see the Pope going electric. It's a small win in a world that faces many challenges on its road toward a more climate-friendly transportation sector, but it's good to have His Holiness on our side. Plus, when they see the Pope riding in silent all-electric comfort, maybe some of his followers will get a bit more excited about the electric future.

The Chinese EV Market Is Now Unbeatable,https://insideevs.com/news/743253/chinese-ev-market-is-now-unbeatable/,"New subsidies, dizzying variety for consumers and sluggish demand for EVs in other parts of the world is helping China further its lead.",2024-12-04 14:00:47,"Over the past decade, Chinese automakers have staged a stunning rise in the auto industry, establishing a clear lead over the U.S. and Europe in democratizing electric vehicles. Now the latest sales data suggests that the country is so far ahead in electrification that a miracle would be needed for others to catch up or come even remotely close.
Data from the China Passenger Car Association, posted on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, indicates that China's EV market accounted for a whopping 76% of global EV sales in October. That figure represents new energy vehicles (NEVs), as they're called in China, which include both fully electric models and plug-in hybrids.
Of the 14.1 million NEVs sold globally between January and October, 69% were in China, as per the CPCA. The U.S. accounted for less than 10% of this, with about 1.28 million EVs and PHEVs sold during the same period. Automakers in Europe sold about 2.32 million units in the first eight months of the year, but that growth is now slowing down as legacy brands in the continent struggle to sell EVs.
When you break down 'NEVs' into EVs and PHEVs, things also look good. From January to October, China's share of fully electric global sales stood at 63.2%. The share of PHEVs reached 78%. Simply put, much of the EV mass adoption is driven by China and Norway, with the former having a far greater statistical significance.
However, not all of this is great news. There have been concerns about EV production overcapacity in China spilling over to the rest of the world, especially the Global South, where Chinese EVs are now increasingly popular. Plus, the European Union has imposed a tariff of up to 45.3% on Chinese cars, while the U.S. and Canada both have a 100% tariff on Chinese EV imports, in addition to a proposed ban on Chinese-origin software in future EVs.
These protectionist measures may help the U.S. and Europe keep its homegrown car factories humming, but the numbers indicate that China's domestic market continues to expand regardless. China doubled its EV subsidy in July. EV buyers who replace their gas cars can now get a subsidy of 20,000 yuan ($2,770), double the 10,000 yuan announced earlier this year.
Plus, the competition in the Chinese EV market is far more cutthroat. Automakers like BYD, SAIC and Xpeng, as well as newcomers like Xiaomi, are battling to gain a higher share of the market. Analysts estimate that less than 20 of the 137 EV brands in China will be profitable by the end of the decade.
Now the incoming Trump administration has threatened to repeal the EV incentives for consumers and possibly even manufacturers, likely allowing China to expand its lead further.

"Genesis Will First Add Hybrids To Its Lineup, Then Range Extenders",https://insideevs.com/news/743249/genesis-range-extenders-coming-2027/,The company is backtracking on its previously announced plan to only introduce electric vehicles after 2025.,2024-12-04 13:00:53,"Genesis isn’t going ahead with its plan to only introduce electric cars after 2025 (and go EV-only after 2030), and it’s going to add hybrid powertrains for most combustion-powered models in its lineup starting next year. Once that’s done, the next step won’t be full EVs (of which it already offers several) but range extenders instead, which the manufacturer expects will be really popular in America.
When Hyundai’s CEO Jaehoon Chang spoke during the automaker’s CEO Investor Day event earlier this year, he said extended-range EVs (EREVs) are seen as “the same as EVs by North American environmental standards.” American regulators do indeed see EREVs as being closer to a pure EV than a hybrid, even though that’s basically what they are.
Range extenders, like the upcoming Ram 1500 Ramcharger or the Mazda MX-30 R-EV, have a smaller battery pack compared to an EV. This allows manufacturers to sell them cheaper since they have fewer (expensive) lithium-ion battery cells. You can look at a range extender as one step above a plug-in hybrid, usually offering more range than a PHEV, but not quite an EV.
Earlier this year, the Korean Car Blog published a report stating that Genesis was going to start building a range-extender GV70 in late 2026 and begin selling it in the U.S. in 2027. The hybrid version of the GV70 will come first, likely next year, followed by the EREV, making the GV70 (pictured) the first Genesis model to offer combustion, hybrid, range extender and full electric powertrains.
The GV70 for the U.S. market is currently being built at the Hyundai manufacturing facility in Alabama, but the range extender will reportedly roll off the assembly line at the manufacturer’s Georgia plant, which currently builds the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9.
Hyundai previously announced that the Georgia facility would also produce hybrids, but it seems now that the manufacturer was likely referring to range extenders.
More On Range Extenders
We don’t know the specifics of the GV70 EREV, but Hyundai has already shared some more general details. We know that even though EREV versions will have a smaller battery, they will have more combined range than pure EVs by including a full tank of fuel. Hyundai says its EREVs will go up to 560 miles (900 km), and it also wants to sell them in China.
The manufacturer wants to sell 40% hybrids globally by 2028, or about 1.33 million vehicles. Offering vehicles with varying levels of electrification (from none to full) is a smart approach by Hyundai that broadens the appeal of its vehicles, and even though it will be first implemented for its Genesis luxury brand, it will likely also be used for Hyundai and Kia too.
More manufacturers will follow and partly shift to range extenders, with the market for pure EVs not looking quite as strong as projections were suggesting a few years ago. Porsche has announced that it wants to add gasoline back into the mix going forward, while Mercedes-Benz reportedly ended its research project into extended-range EVs, although it too has backtracked on its EV plans—the new CLA, which will be available as a hybrid or EV shows Mercedes' midterm strategy.",Andrei Nedelea
Lucid Could Use Two-Speed Transmissions In Future EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/743104/lucid-two-speed-electric-vehicle-patent/,The American automaker is interested in two-speed transmissions that allow electric motors to operate in ideal ranges at different speeds.,2024-12-25 01:25:54,"Although Lucid already makes the world's most efficient electric cars, it's keen to extend its lead. One area other automakers like Porsche have explored to boost their EVs' range is the use of two-speed transmissions. Lucid has yet to do so, but now it looks like it might apply the technology in its own unique way.
If you don't know how Lucid's drive unit works, you should read up on it. The system is ingenious and, as it turns out, flexible. The electric motor's speed is reduced from tens of thousands of RPM down to wheel speeds by two separate planetary gearsets on either end of the casing. This allows the motor and gearboxes to be coaxial, reducing the drive unit's size and mass. Planetary gearboxes can also be used as transmissions by braking separate parts of the mechanism, and that's what Lucid is doing here.
A patent applied for back in 2023 and recently granted to the automaker describes part of this system, although the precise design seems somewhat obscured. Several patents reference different aspects of what is likely a new drive unit configuration, so the exact nature of it all isn't entirely clear just by reading this one document.
What we can nail down, though, is that the system uses one or more planetary sets on either side of a coaxial drive unit to achieve its two speeds. A system of one-way clutches enables these two ratios. How much of a difference in efficiency can this make? Automakers and suppliers have claimed gains in the region of five percent, although it's going to depend on how and where you drive.
Lucid might be shooting higher than that with this unique design. In recent interviews, the automaker's chief executive, Peter Rawlinson, has claimed the company wants to achieve six miles per kilowatt-hour. For reference, the most efficient Lucid Air can currently achieve about five miles per kilowatt-hour. Do the math on a car with a 100kWh battery; it's a big difference not only in pure range, but also the rate at which charging gets you miles back in the battery. Any charging speed is effectively multiplied by the drivetrain's efficiency.
We know Lucid's SUV, the Gravity, is coming soon. Another mid-size car is coming after that. It's plausible that this new drivetrain tech could be applied to any vehicle in the automaker's lineup, though. An updated Air sedan could see a two-speed transmission get added to at least one axle, although that's pure speculation. Until the automaker pipes up, we won't know its plans for this tech.

The Honda Prologue Is Becoming America’s Sweetheart EV,https://insideevs.com/news/743220/honda-prologue-sales-november-2024/,Honda sold more Prologue EVs in November than Volvo sold EX40s and C40s in the first 11 months of this year.,2024-12-04 11:00:07,"The Honda Prologue is proving to be this year’s underdog. A badge-engineered Chevrolet Blazer EV with the added benefit of Apple CarPlay, the Prologue is Honda’s only electric offering in the United States. Its future was uncertain, especially considering the not-so-rosy state of General Motors’ Ultium efforts at the beginning of the year.
But what started as a big bag of uncertainties eventually became a resounding success. The Prologue is a hit and it proves Honda is capable of stepping up its electrification game with everything it entails–good lease deals, readily available inventory and an expansive service network.
Honda sold 6,823 Prologue EVs last month alone and 25,132 units from January through November. To put things into perspective, Honda sold more Prologue EVs in a single month than Volvo’s two-EV portfolio managed in 11 months. Year-to-date, the Volvo EX40 and C40 amassed 4,819 sales in the United States and just 493 sales in November. (Yes, it’s bad for Volvo here.)
More Stuff Like This
By comparison, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, which is very similar to the Honda Prologue (they’re even built in the same factory in Mexico), sold 7,998 units in the three months of the previous quarter. Similarly, the Cadillac Lyriq scored 7,224 sales in Q3, while the smaller Chevrolet Equinox EV saw 9,772 sales in the previous quarter.
General Motors doesn’t offer monthly sales figures for its cars, so it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, but from what we have available, it’s clear that Honda is doing something better than GM even though the cars are very similar. The Prologue also did better than the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Toyota bZ4X and Nissan Ariya in October.
At the end of the day, the answer to selling more EVs might be very simple: give people a solid choice with a decent range, decent looks and decent specs. No gimmicks, just something that ticks enough boxes to convince people they’re not making a mistake.
In the case of the Prologue, it offers Apple CarPlay, something that GM decided against in its latest EVs, up to 296 miles of range and a maximum DC charging speed of 150 kilowatts. It doesn’t excel in any way, but it’s just enough for a lot of people.",Iulian Dnistran
Why General Motors Just Took A $5 Billion Hit In China,https://insideevs.com/news/743209/gm-china-5-billion-cm/,"Also on today's Critical Materials roundup: how Stellantis' ex-CEO made ""enemies with everybody.""",2024-12-04 09:54:03,"For much of this year, we've been covering the rise of the Chinese auto industry as primarily a problem for the European auto industry.

Tariffs here in the U.S. have kept that problem away from our shores. But car companies are global operators, and if you want an example of how intense this challenge is, look no further than General Motors.
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and technology news. Also on our agenda today: how Stellantis' CEO got fed up and quit after basically making enemies with everyone, and Hyundai gets ready for an Android Automotive shift.
Beijing Auto Show Buick
China was like a giant money-printer for GM for more than a decade. When the country's modern economic boom really started kicking off in force, a newly empowered generation of buyers fell in love with cars from the American automaker, Buick in particular. For a while, it seemed like GM could see almost endless growth in the world's biggest car market, aided (and for a while, legally mandated) by a range of joint ventures with local automakers.
That was then. Now, Chinese drivers want Chinese cars, in large part because their electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid technology far surpasses what the rest of the world can do. GM sales have been plummeting in China for years and the entire operation now needs restructuring. The cost of that is more than $5 billion. Automotive News explains:
GM said in a Dec. 4 regulatory filing that it will take noncash charges of $2.7 billion for the restructuring and $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion to account for the diminished value of its equity in the 50-50 joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp. The charges will affect GM’s net income primarily in the fourth quarter and will be reported as one-time special items.
GM said in the filing that its board of directors’ audit committee determined Dec. 2 that the impairment was necessary “based on a determination that a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JVs is other than temporary in light of the finalization of a new business forecast and certain restructuring actions that SGM is finalizing that are expected to be taken to address market challenges and competitive conditions.”
GM has lost money in China for three consecutive quarters, with its sales in the country falling 18 percent in the first nine months of the year to 1.2 million vehicles. SAIC-GM, which builds Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac vehicles, is one of two joint ventures for the automaker in China.
I don't think I need to explain how much $5 billion is a lot of money, but just in case, let's put that write-down into perspective a bit. GM's global net income before taxes in 2023 was $12.4 billion. Its profits in Q3 of this year before taxes was $4.1 billion. It is projecting pre-tax annual profits of between $14 billion and $15 billion for 2024.
So this loss was basically like wiping out a quarter of profits, not just revenue, and then some, or more than a third of its profits from 2023. There's no other way to put this: ouch.
As I mentioned, GM is hardly alone in its China problems. Volkswagen had success there for decades and it's got similar troubles now. Nissan is basically throwing in the towel in China and even mighty Toyota is getting hammered there. Even Tesla has intense competition in China after kickstarting the modern EV market, and while it's held the line better than most, it can't fend off that much heat forever.
As that story notes, GM CEO Mary Barra in October promised ""a significant reduction in dealer inventory and modest improvements in sales and share"" for China, which is a nice way of saying everybody just needs to lower their expectations from now on. And that portends bad omens for GM's future bottom line.
Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO
As I noted in Monday's Critical Materials, nobody seems sad to see Stellantis' Carlos Tavares abruptly quit his CEO role well ahead of his scheduled 2026 retirement. But that's pretty much the problem in a nutshell.
Reuters has a great deep-dive into what led Tavares to quit, and the biggest factor was reportedly his disputes with the Stellantis board and his total lack of allies in the auto sector. By the end, the board didn't agree with his strategies, and the dealers, suppliers, unions and even customers were fed up with him as well.
If you've ever been in any kind of professional leadership role, you know that playing the politician can be an important part of what you do. And when you don't have any friends left, it's time to go. From that story:
On Sunday, Senior Independent Director Henri de Castries said in a statement that differing views emerged in recent weeks among the CEO, major shareholders and the board.
In November, however, Tavares' brash style led to a ""totally untenable"" relationship with the board, whose members represent major shareholders Exor, the Peugeot family and the French government, the other source said. When board members started asking more specific questions about the executive's strategies, the person said, ""Tavares' reaction was: 'You do not interfere with my job—that is not your business.'""
Board members, irritated, continued pressing Tavares, the source said. They were unsettled by what they viewed as the CEO's relentless but narrow focus on cost-cutting, which had caused supply disruptions and angered dealers. Those problems had been overlooked in previous years, when Stellantis was hitting double-digit profit margins.
Now those and other issues were causing angst across the sprawling company, as Tavares tangled with dealers, unions, suppliers and governments - and now board members
""You cannot make enemies with everybody,"" the person said.
Tavares was renowned in the industry for his cost-cutting skills but not so much for his people skills. Now, Stellantis—which includes 14 brands that operate globally—faces a very uncertain future at a time when it should have had a viable plan years ago.
Speaking of automakers with a plan: you can't deny that Hyundai Motor Group is doing pretty well at the moment. Its EVs are popping off and it's executing hard on hybrids too at a time when GM, for example, is scrambling to figure out where it put the ""How to engineer a Chevy Volt"" manual. But as a Kia EV6 owner myself, I'd say that Hyundai's overall software game isn't where it needs to be yet. Over-the-air updates, navigation and integrated apps just aren't as world-class as the powertrains are.
But there's light at the end of the tunnel and it comes from Google. Hyundai's upcoming cars, starting with the next-generation Ioniq 5 (not the 2025 one with NACS, but whatever's next) will be the first to use Android Automotive. That's the system used by GM, Volvo and a few others, and it comes with full Google integration for Google Maps and other services; I'm a big fan of this system and think it's among the best out there now.
Hyundai dropped that tidbit in its Investor Day event in October but it didn't get a ton of traction until Korean Car Blog pointed it out the other day:
The next-generation IONIQ 5 (known internally as NE2) will operate on an Android-based operating system, introducing a larger and more advanced center screen to host Google Maps. This move underscores Hyundai’s dedication to delivering state-of-the-art technology to its customers.
Google Maps offers exceptional features, including precise navigation, real-time traffic updates, and a vast database of searchable locations. Hyundai’s decision to integrate this platform aligns with its goal of providing drivers with a more seamless and efficient driving experience.
The rollout of mass-produced vehicles is scheduled for 2026. Initial sales will target the U.S., with production at Hyundai’s Meta Plant in America, before expanding to other regions.
I hope this spreads across the board. An update to my car is unlikely, but if I could use Google Maps all of the time instead of the EV6's native navigation, I'd be over the moon.
Ioniq 9 Apple CarPlay
Let's turn away from Tavares (who, after making $39 million a year, is probably gonna chill on a yacht for the rest of his life) and China woes to talk tech. We're almost done with 2024 and a ton of new EVs hit the market this year. Which company is doing software the best, and is that influencing your purchasing decisions at all?
Also: the answer is ""Apple and Google,"" right?

This Guy Made A High-Capacity E-Bike Battery Out Of OId Vape Pens,https://www.rideapart.com/news/742372/homemade-ebike-battery-disposable-vape-pens/,It’ll make you rethink what should and shouldn’t be thrown in the dumpster.,2024-12-25 01:25:55,"We humans are an inherently wasteful species, and nowhere is this more evident than today. Everything from single-use plastics to disposable electronics are a living testament to this. The sad reality is that a lot of us simply don’t care about how our actions affect the planet, not just for now, but for future generations, too.
We don’t really need to look at the bigger picture, either. The smallest things we do can have a profound effect on the world around us. Take, for example, vapes. I’m sure a lot of you own and use a vape on a regular basis. You see, e-waste is a thing, and the e-waste brought about by disposable vapes seems more than enough to outdo any supposed good they bring to the table.
This was brought to light in an incredibly eye-opening way by UK-based YouTuber and Electrical Engineer Chris Doel when he gathered hundreds of discarded vapes at a music festival and transformed them into something very valuable, something people would pay hundreds of dollars for.
More often than not, the most expensive component in any small electric mobility device is its battery. Spare lithium-ion batteries for e-bikes can set you back hundreds of dollars. But as Chris Doel demonstrates, a look inside reveals that most if not all lithium-ion e-bike batteries are made of the same stuff found inside disposable vapes.
Of course, the logical thing to do here was to put his electrical engineering skills to the test and create his very own e-bike battery out of the discarded vapes. And this is exactly what he did. You can check out the video, and all the creative thinking that went into building the homemade e-bike battery by clicking here.
Chris quickly went to work dismantling every vape and plucking out its battery. He then made use of 3D-printed battery modules to hold the individual cells, and began wiring them together in series, essentially transforming the individual battery cells into one gigantic 48-volt battery.
The technical side of this is very, well, technical, but Chris does a really good job of making it easy to swallow for non-electrically minded folks. But the biggest point here is that he was essentially able to make a high-capacity, high-performance e-bike battery out of literal garbage. All he had to purchase was the 3D-printed modules and battery case, as well as the battery management system—a fraction of what he would’ve otherwise spent if he had bought a brand-new battery.
Talk about turning trash into treasure.
After building his homemade battery, he quickly slapped it onto his e-bike, and managed to cover 33 kilometers all without any pedaling whatsoever. Not bad, and actually at par with a lot of the more affordable ready-made e-bikes on the market today. If he were to use it on pedal assist mode, there’s a good chance he could’ve gone twice the distance, too.
Now, the point of this whole project was clearly to prove a point. There’s so much more to the stuff we treat as garbage, to the point that the whole system is severely flawed. Vape manufacturers intentionally stuff rechargeable batteries into their products without allowing users to charge them, and instead dispose of them while still having a lot of service life left in them.
The batteries used in Chris’ homemade battery pack are rated for around 300 recharge cycles, but the Vape manufacturers that use them only allow you to use them for one.
It took around 130 vapes for Chris to build this e-bike battery for next to nothing. And he explains that around 260 million disposable vapes are thrown away every single year in the UK alone. That translates to around 2,000,000 e-bike batteries, if Chris’ formula were to be followed. So yeah, there’s no shortage of raw materials for making batteries. It’s all just being used for the wrong stuff.
And it isn’t just the batteries that are wasted here, either. Chris points out that a lot of the vape cases are actually made of aluminum, and can be collected and sent over for recycling. Instead, people are leaving them discarded on the floor of clubs, bars, and music festivals. Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if you could actually make a whole bicycle frame out of all the vapes Chris managed to collect.
So yeah, it’s crazy to see how some companies have the audacity to be so wasteful. But that’s largely because they know they can make a buck off of consumers who wouldn’t think twice about throwing away something that’s still very much useful.
So at the end of the day, it’s on us to change the way things work. I’m not saying that you should go out there and aim for a zero-waste lifestyle. This simply isn’t possible for a lot of us. But being more mindful and deliberate, and doing our research on the stuff we buy, will certainly go a long way.

Americans Just Aren't Buying Volvo EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/743198/volvo-ev-sales-us-november-2024/,"Without the entry-level EX30 on dealer lots, the Swedish automaker sold shockingly few EVs in the U.S. last month.",2024-12-04 08:14:44,"Volvo is struggling to sell all-electric cars in the United States. While its EV game has seen solid gains in Europe, China and everywhere else, the story is completely different stateside. As in, it’s very bad. And a lack of new models that are powering Volvo's electric success elsewhere is to blame.
In November, Volvo sold just 493 fully electric cars in the U.S. No typos, you read that correctly. To make matters worse, that's down 41% compared to last November when 840 EVs were sold stateside, but the final blow comes when comparing year-to-date sales.
In the first 11 months of 2024, Volvo sold 4,819 EVs, down a whopping 63% from last year’s 12,923 units. To put things in perspective, Honda has sold 25,000 Prologue EVs since the beginning of the year, and that car isn’t even Honda’s own creation—instead, it’s based on General Motors’ Ultium platform and is assembled alongside other GM EVs in Mexico.
More Volvo Stuff
Back in October, Volvo said that “the car market in the company’s main regions of Europe, China and the U.S. is increasingly under pressure which affects demand.” But General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Kia are doing quite well, so surely there must be other factors at play here.
One reason I can think of is the current EV portfolio offered to American customers. The EX40 and EC40 (formerly known as the XC40 Recharge and C40 Rechage) are the only EVs on sale right now in the U.S., and they’re both $50,000+ cars. We're generally fans of them here at InsideEVs, but in terms of specs they're rather dated compared to more modern examples.
The real problem in the U.S. is the lack of the entry-level EX30. That car should've been on sale earlier this year but because it's made in China, it got spiked by Biden administration tariffs—leaving Volvo without this huge electric growth driver it has in Europe and other regions.
After Volvo worked out pricing, the EX30 is finally on its way to the U.S., with deliveries set to begin before the year ends. In Europe, it proved to be a hit, but because the first version to ship to the U.S. will be the mid-tier, dual-motor, its starting price is $46,195 (including destination).
The Volvo EX30 will arrive at U.S. dealerships by the year's end.
That’s a pretty penny for a car that’s about the same size as a Hyundai Kona, so it will be interesting to see if the subcompact crossover will turn the tide for Volvo stateside. Granted, the Kona doesn't have 422 horsepower, but in such a small car, that sounds like overkill.
And then there's the much more luxurious EX90 SUV. Originally positioned as an electric successor the XC90 that helped reset Volvo for the modern era (which is now returning as a hybrid), American supplies of the EX90 are off to a slow start. A search of Cars.com reveals fewer than 300 are for sale nationwide as of this writing and our early tests indicated it doesn't feel quite ""finished"" in terms of software and features, so Volvo Cars USA won't be able to count on that as a growth-driver for a while.
Also, it’s not all bad news for Volvo. In Europe, sales of its all-electric lineup went up 50% in November and 86% year-on-year. Overall, including combustion vehicles, global sales went up 5% last month and year-to-date, the Swedish automaker sold 9% more cars than in 2023.
Globally, EV sales are also doing well, with a 40% increase in November and a 59% increase year-over-year–it’s just the United States where the brand is suffering on the EV front.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Lease Prices Drop Amid Looming Demand Issues,https://insideevs.com/news/743151/tesla-cybertruck-lease-price-decrease/,"It’s still not cheap, but at least it’s moving in the right direction.",2024-12-04 03:47:57,"The Tesla Cybertruck is now cheaper to lease. That said, it’s still not exactly what I’d call “cheap.”
Arguably the most controversial vehicle on sale today in the United States, the Cybertruck is listed on the automaker's website with a starting lease price of $899 per month for the entry-level All-Wheel Drive version, while the tri-motor Cyberbeast is $100 more.
That’s a $100 decrease compared to the initial pricing, but don’t let the numbers fool you because the story is a little more complicated. First, the new prices are valid with a $7,500 down payment, a 30,000-mile limit and a 36-month term.
Second, several taxes need to be paid in order to get the EV into your hands, including a $695 acquisition fee. Then, there’s a $395 disposition fee when returning the vehicle. So, let’s do some simple math. With $7,500 down, a 36-month agreement and a 10,000-mile annual limit, we get an effective monthly payment of $1,137. If you want to buy the truck at the end of the lease agreement, there's an additional fee of up to $350.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Want to drive 15,000 miles per year? Sure, you can do that, but it will cost you $1,175 per month. There’s also a 24-month lease option which comes down to $1,347 per month. Cheap, it is not, but neither is the Rivian R1T, which costs $1,061 per month for 36 months and 30,000 miles if you go for the dual-motor version with the Large battery pack.
In the case of the Cybetruck, it looks like Tesla is doing everything it can to boost sales. The angular pickup had a great sales start this year, becoming the best-selling pickup in the United States along the way, but that might not hold for long. This week, assembly workers at the Austin factory where the Cybertruck is made have been told to stay home until Friday. Previously, the reservation backlog seemed to have been exhausted after less than a year, despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk claiming the Cybertruck amassed “millions” of reservations.
According to data from Cox Automotive, roughly fewer than 30,000 Cybertruck were sold and registered in the United States in the first nine months. That’s a solid performance from a newcomer and one that beat both the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T. That said, we’ll see what will happen during the fourth quarter.",Iulian Dnistran
Why Hyundai Is Sticking With CarPlay 'Right Now',https://insideevs.com/news/743097/hyundai-apple-carplay-gm/,The brand is open to better alternatives to CarPlay in the future. But right now it wants to give people options.,2024-12-03 14:00:00,"If you’ve been turned off by General Motors’ now-infamous decision to eliminate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from its electric cars, here’s some good news for you: Hyundai’s got your back.
The South Korean brand is sticking with the popular phone-mirroring applications, a Hyundai executive told InsideEVs recently. For now, at least.
“Right now, we’re still maintaining Android Auto and Carplay,” Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy at Hyundai, said in an interview. “It’s a little bit like EV charging. As we’re moving, give people all the options.”
The Hyundai Ioniq 9.
Boyle is referring to Hyundai’s decision to adopt Tesla’s charging port design and give its customers access to around 17,000 Tesla Supercharger plugs. (That’s something most of the auto industry has done too, I might add, but Hyundai has been particularly speedy about it.) She says during this time of profound change in the auto industry—from familiar gas cars to software-heavy, battery-powered vehicles—it’s key to give consumers options and not try to force them into a technology they’re not ready for.
For Hyundai, that means beefing up its cars’ user interfaces while also delivering the CarPlay and Android Auto people know and love. It also means offering combustion models, hybrids and plug-in hybrids alongside fully electric cars. “Eventually, we’ll all be fully EV,” Boyle said. “But it’s going to take some time, and you don’t want your business to fail in between. So you need to have a strategy that can adapt.”
Unsatisfied with the relatively low-margin business of selling cars, automakers have been trying to act more like tech companies. They’ve got big plans to rake in billions off of software services like games, subscriptions and entertainment features. That’s pushed carmakers to invest more in sleek digital interfaces and it’s led some—like GM—to shun the influence of Apple and Google from their software ecosystems.
GM has caught a lot of flack for its move, since so many Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC drivers like the convenience of using their phone's operating system and have a bad association with historically clunky automotive software. Others, like Tesla and startup Rivian, have never offered CarPlay either.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Hyundai hasn’t gone that far, but it is working on its tech. In the just-unveiled Ioniq 9 three-row SUV, the brand debuted “features on demand,” a platform that lets owners buy upgrades for their vehicle on the go. It’s starting out with special lighting options and custom themes for the SUV’s displays.
Whether automaker software and phone-mirroring features coexist in the future or not, Boyle thinks the auto industry will eventually converge on some kind of standard. Knowing what Hyundai has in the pipeline, she says there may be better alternatives to CarPlay and Android Auto “that people are not even imagining now.” That “might be the future,” she said.
Still, getting people to change their ways would be a battle. “People are so tied to everything,” Boyle said. “So we’re going to give it some time to play out.”

"Honda's First Electric Scooters For India Are Coming Soon, You Guys",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742510/honda-activa-qc1-ev-scooters/,One of them is even bringing the swappable Honda Mobile Power Pack e: to the party in select cities!,2024-12-25 01:25:57,"If you've been reading RideApart for a minute, you may be aware that I've been following Honda's Mobile Power Pack e: developments with interest for the past few years.
So far, we've seen it appear in scooters in Japan, Europe, and Indonesia, in construction equipment, in cool concepts for electric generators that can power your home, and even powering tourist boats. Will you need more than one HMPP e: for some of these applications? Sure, but the modularity and purposely wide range of use cases is kind of the entire point of this system.
If you've been wondering when Honda would finally bring the HMPP e: to India, the wait is over at last. Order for the newest member of the Honda Activa family, the Activa e: (you totally saw that name coming, right?) will officially open in India on January 1, 2025.
For those unfamiliar, the combustion version of the Honda Activa has been extremely popular for a long time, so developing an EV version that utilizes the new HMPP e: was kind of a no-brainer. Of course, if you're going to have swappable batteries, you also need swappable battery stations that riders can access and use out in the wild.
So far, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India has established Honda Power Pack Exchanger swap stations in Bengaluru and Delhi, with additional plans to roll out in Mumbai soon. The Activa e: uses two HMPP e: packs, which each provide 1.5 kWh and offer a claimed 102 kilometers (about 63.3 miles) on a single charge. For city riding, something like this is ideal. This is where EV motorbikes absolutely thrive.
At the same time, Honda India is also introducing a non-swappable EV scooter, the QC 1. Both scoots get cool modern features like full LED lighting, ride modes, and big digital displays on their dashboards (a whopping 7-inch TFT display on the Activa e: and a smaller 5-inch LCD on the QC1). The Activa e: can also offer phone connectivity via the optional Honda Roadsync Duo app, allowing for turn-by-turn navigation, phone and music access, and more.
Pricing information hasn't been announced yet, but deliveries are expected to begin in February 2025. Additionally, HMSI says it's hoping to produce around 100,000 of both of these electric scooters (combined, not individually) from its plants in India per year. Will the demand be there? That remains to be seen, but Honda India's most recent moves seem to indicate that it knows what it's doing.

EVs And Hybrids Helped Hyundai And Kia Reach Record Sales Last Month,https://insideevs.com/news/743077/hyundai-kia-record-sales-november-ev-phev/,"The Kia EV9 is already selling better than the EV6. At Hyundai, EV sales went up a whopping 77% from last year.",2024-12-03 11:00:51,"It’s safe to say that both Hyundai and Kia are doing pretty well on the all-electric and electrified vehicle front. The two Korean automakers posted best-ever November sales numbers in the United States, thanks in part to their battery-powered model lineup.
Hyundai’s total sales, including combustion, hybrid and electric models, went up 8% last month. However, it’s on the electrified front where the numbers are truly staggering: EVs went up 77% year-over-year, hybrid sales grew by 104% and all electrified model sales (EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids) increased by 92%.
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV went up an impressive 110% year-over-year in November. Sales of the Santa Fe hybrid jumped 64% while the Tucson plug-in hybrid went up 23%. In total, Hyundai Motor America sold 76,008 cars in November–out of these, 4,989 were Ioniq 5s and 1,121 were Ioniq 6s.
More Good News
Meanwhile, Kia sold 70,107 units last month. That’s a 20% increase over November 2023 and the first-ever November to surpass the 70,000-unit mark stateside. A big part of this success is attributed to the SUV lineup’s sales performance, as well as the significant gains recorded by the automaker’s electrified vehicle lineup.
“Hyundai delivered an exceptional sales month, driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor America. “Customers continue to be attracted to Hyundai’s diverse vehicle lineup which can meet a variety of customer needs. We also saw significant interest and excitement for the worldwide debut of the U.S.-built IONIQ 9 and we can’t wait to bring it to market next year.”
The all-electric EV6 saw sales climb 46% year-over-year, while the Sportage models (combustion, hybrid and plug-in hybrid) went up 28%. The EV9 electric three-row family sold 2,155 units last month, slightly better than the EV6’s 1,887 units. In total, Kia sold 20,066 EV9s and 19,604 EV6s in the first 11 months in the United States.
The Ioniq 5 was Hyundai's best-selling EV in November.
At Kia, the EV9 surpassed the EV6 to become its best-selling EV in November.
“Kia is clearly a brand on the move with world-class ICE and electrified vehicles that far exceed consumer expectations that have helped us achieve back-to-back monthly sales records in Q4,” said Eric Watson, vice president, sales operations, Kia America. “The Telluride has had an immeasurable impact on Kia since launching in 2019, and to reach all-time best monthly sales in 2024 speaks to its enduring appeal. And with five all-new and significantly redesigned vehicles recently unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show, we have no plans of slowing down.”
With an increasing portfolio of electric vehicles, including the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and sporty Kia EV9 GT, the two Korean automakers are on their way to a very good year in sales. However, looking at the numbers posted so far, it’s clear that there is still a long way to go until pure EVs catch up to their combustion and hybrid counterparts. At Hyundai, the combined year-to-date sales of the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 amount to 50,860 units–just 6.7% of the total 758,304 vehicles sold. It’s worth mentioning that the sales of the Kona EV are not reported separately from the rest of the versions, but it’s unlikely it would make a big dent in the big picture.
At Kia, the story is similar: the individual sales of the Niro EV are not reported separately, but the EV6 and EV9 managed to sell 39,670 units combined in the first 11 months–just 5.5% of the total volume of 723,185 cars sold to date.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tesla Won't Sell You A V2L Adapter, But These Companies Will",https://insideevs.com/news/742948/tesla-model-v2l-power-adapter/,"Tesla couldn't be bothered by adding V2L to its cars, so companies are taking it into their own hands.",2024-12-03 10:00:05,"Tesla, once a pioneer in the EV space, is falling behind. Now, sure, the EV maker's cars still boast cutting-edge tech and a promise to become robotaxis, but there are some glaring omissions from the hot-tech list that other automakers have begun to make standard features in their battery-powered cars. One of those happens to be bidirectional Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) power sharing.
Despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk calling V2L ""extremely inconvenient,"" Telsa said the feature would come to its EVs in 2025. But rather than wait for Tesla to make good on its promise, third-party companies are taking it into their own hands. Tesla's V2L era is (prematurely) here.
Vortipower is the newest company specializing in Tesla-V2L to start making waves on social media. Its product, which gives 3.5 kilowatts of juice in the form of two 15-amp 120-volt outlets, promises to make the process of V2L super simple for owners—just plug in and go. That's enough power to run a refrigerator, space heater, an air conditioner, or some lights if the power in your home were to go out. The device will continue to sip power until the car reaches 20% remaining in its high-voltage pack and then cut off the electricity to any connected device to avoid discharging the battery too far.
Now, here's the gripe—this product is expensive. At the $1,499 list price, it towers above the $99 adapters offered by Lectron for the Hyundai's E-GMP vehicles. Fortunately, there are more affordable options. Chinese accessory manufacturer WeiDian sells a similar product called the Power 2 for under $350 in its domestic market. Then there's A2Z EV (the company that makes the controversial Supercharger extension cables) that sells a V2L adapter with just one outlet for a more reasonable $130.
Vortipower claims that it has verified that its V2L adapter works with ""all Tesla models currently available on the market,"" including older variants of those models. While it doesn't hold a UL certification, it also says that the way it saps power from the car's high-voltage battery is safe and won't adversely affect the pack's health.
However, that's not to say that Tesla won't have problems with you running one of these adapters. See, the automaker has a bit of a conflict of interest in order—which could be one of the reasons that it hasn't enabled power sharing in the majority of its cars just yet. Enter: the Powerwall.
One of Tesla's revenue generation schemes is its whole-home battery backup, the Powerwall. By enabling cars to share power, even something as simple as V2L, it's hard to ignore that this takes away from the value of its $10,000 battery backup system and could undercut demand. The conflict becomes even more apparent when peeking at Tesla's limited vehicle warranty, which explicitly prohibits using the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, or Model X ""as a stationary power source"" and voids the warranty.
Vortipower says that it can't guarantee its product doesn't void Tesla's warranty either:
""While we cannot guarantee that Tesla’s warranty will remain unaffected, we’ve designed the PowerShare device to operate safely within Tesla’s protocols,"" wrote Vortipower. ""Our product is engineered to avoid causing harm to the vehicle’s battery or systems when used as intended.""
Meanwhile, owners are stuck waiting. Tesla insisted that it would bring bi-directional charging to all models in 2025, though it was in the middle of retooling its power electronics when it made that promise in 2023. Whether Tesla meant all legacy models or just new vehicles is an unknown—Tesla is known for enabling new features via a simple software update—but if the feature is reliant on a power electronics hardware upgrade, then it may not be so simple.
It seems that the functionality is already there, at least for basic 3.5-kW V2L needs. If nothing else, products like Vortipower highlight just how accessible the power is, even if the means of tapping into it aren't officially sanctioned. However, with Tesla threatening the vehicle's warranty, one use of the charger could make a simple warranty claim an uphill battle with the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act. Is it worth it to beat Tesla to the punch? Maybe. But I'll let you decide.

Today, we're chatting about Musk's newly-rejected $56 billion pay package (yes, again), Stellantis gets a $7.5 billion EV loan, and General Motors cashes out of a nearly-completed battery plant. Let's jump in.
On Monday, the Delaware judge presiding over perhaps the largest single display of corporate opulence in history decided that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not entitled to a pay package now valued at $101.4 billion after post-election share price jumps, the New York Times reports. For the record, that's up rom $56 billion previously. This might seem like something you've heard before, but the Monday ruling of Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick is upholding the court's previous verdict denouncing the pay package despite majority shareholder backing in June.
First, the backstory. McCormick's initial rejection of Musk's pay package stems back to 2018 when the compensation package was drafted. According to McCormick, Musk improperly controlled the process used to negotiate the pay package. Furthermore, the judge noted governance irregularities, including that the board was populated with members who were ""beholden"" to the CEO which created a vast conflict of interest.
The board argued that Musk deserved the compensation package given that he managed to hit all of the seemingly insurmountable targets, and thus created immense profits for the company (and investors).
McCormick asked the board to go back to the drawing board and renegotiate the package before properly presenting it to shareholders. Instead, Tesla used a Delaware corporate loophole to call a shareholder vote to ratify the pay package. Things got even more serious when the board created a website and even paid for ads on the CEO's privately-owned social media platform, X, urging shareholders to vote in favor of the package. Shareholders voted and the compensation package passed.
However, Monday's decision by McCormick ratified a formal rejection of the plea to reinstate Musk's pay package.
“Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” said McCormick in her 101-page ruling.
Now, look, it's easy to see why this is such a hotly debated topic. Musk isn't the most popular guy right now, and $100 billion (let alone the initial $56 billion) is a lot of money, even for the world's richest person. Hell, it's almost the entirety of Bill Gates's net worth.
But it's hard to ignore why, from a financial perspective, this is such a big story. It's the single largest executive pay package in history. To put it into perspective, it's 33 times larger than the next-largest executive compensation plan.
As of Monday, Forbes' billionaire list puts Musk's net worth at $336.8 billion, roughly $110.9 billion ahead of the world's next-richest person, Jeff Bezos.
So what's next? It's unclear, but it's extremely likely that the rejection will be challenged by Tesla, Musk, and a team of lawyers. Musk called the decision ""absolute corruption"" and ""totally crazy,"" followed by a slurry of reposts on X showing his displeasure with the judge's ruling.
It's possible that an appeal could be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, though that could push this final outcome out a year or more.
Stellantis, abruptly left without a CEO at the helm over the weekend, may soon join the ranks of Rivian with a multi-billion-dollar loan from the U.S. Department of Energy aimed at furthering the domestic production of EVs.
Uncle Sam is opening up his checkbook and is ready to sign a whopping $7.54 billion payment to a joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI called StarPlus Energy. The large cash infusion is part of the outgoing Biden administration's plan to domesticate EV production all the way down to the battery level. StarPlus' loan will be used to supercharge its battery cell output by bankrolling the venture's planned production sites in Indiana.
Call it the next gold rush, or maybe the EV equivalent of drill, baby, drill—whatever it may be, know that battery production is so hot right now. StarPlus knows this, which is why it's setting up shop at not one, but two planned plants in Indiana where it intends to manufacture enough batteries to power 670,000 vehicles annually.
The first plant, which is already under construction, is slated to open in 2025 while the second is slated for 2027. Separately, Stellantis intends to build another battery factory in Canada with the help of LG Energy Solution.
More and more automakers have been domesticating EV production all the way down to the component level. This Biden-era shift has been influenced by the EV tax credit, which requires production and battery materials to be sourced more domestically. Likely, this protectionist-influenced shift will be aided by the CHIPS act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act (which brought the EV tax credits) and with DoE-issued loans such as what Stellantis and other automakers are conditionally receiving.
We also know that the Biden administration is shoveling out this money as fast as it can before the government changes in January, so expect more news along these lines, potentially.
EV automaker Rivian was recently awarded a $6.6 billion conditional loan by the same office. Musk, who was tasked with heading the ironically-named Department of Government Efficiency under the incoming Trump administration, criticized the DoE's decision to issue Rivian a loan despite Tesla also receiving funds from the DoE in 2010. Musk has not yet commented on the DoE's decision to loan the StarPlus venture roughly 15% more.
While Stellantis is preparing to gear up battery production, GM has worked out that it needs to downsize. The automotive giant has decided that it will unload its stake in the nearly-completed $2.6 billion Lansing, Michigan battery production plant to its production partner, LG Energy Solution (LGES).
GM's pull-out represents a larger cooling for the EV industry which overshot its expectations globally on how rapidly electric car sales would take off. CEO Mary Barra told the world earlier this year that the parent company expected to miss its goal of one million GM-powered EVs hitting the road in 2025 because of the ""market not developing"" as expected. Now GM will offload its stake in the plant just before it is expected to go online.
To put into perspective just how close this plant is to being finished, GM said earlier this year that production was expected to start in early 2025—three years after the plans were revealed to the world. The plant was expected to employ around 1,700 people, though it's not clear if this will change under LGES' control.
GM says that it has around $1 billion tied up in the plant but expects to recoup its investment when the two companies close the deal in March.
The move also comes just after GM says that it plans to ditch its hard-pushed Ultium branding amid a larger shift in electrification strategy. The brand says that the name will be sunset and won't refer to any of its future battery products, only those involved with its LGES joint venture, which, obviously no longer includes its Lansing plant.
Furthermore, GM is convinced that a ""one type fits all"" battery is no longer the path forward. It will instead tailor solutions to fit its vehicles, meaning using a combination of high-nickel, mild-nickel, and Lithium Ion Phosphate (LFP) chemistry across its packs, which could be existing pouch cells or easier-to-assemble prismatic cells. It sounds exhausting, working all of this new tech into a rapidly changing industry. But GM seems to know what it's doing here, so let's trust the process and see where it takes the brand.
GM is up to something. With the automaker slicing Ultium out of its lineup and pulling the plug on one of the most anticipated battery plants that have yet-to-open, it's clear that the brand has had a revelation on the electrification front.
The moves came just months after GM's new battery chief, Kurt Kelty, joined staff as the Vice President of Batteries (fun title). And if that name sounds familiar, it's because Kelty was one of Tesla's longtime battery executives. His task? According to a GM spokesperson speaking with InsideEVs in February, solve more future-facing problems rather than focus on immediate Ultium issues. Think: cost reductions, end-to-end battery development, and more.
It seems like GM is at a pivotal point in its EV timeline and the brand has already made a decision on how it needs to navigate a changing political and unsettled economic climate. But what exactly is GM's secret sauce? And, more importantly, what would you like to see GM do with its all-but-blank battery slate for future vehicles? Let me know in the comments.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Rally Actually Rocks: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/742491/2024-ford-mustang-mach-e-rally-review/,This isn't just another crossover with a badge—the Mach-E Rally is genuinely good on the dirt.,2024-12-25 01:25:59,"There are so many crossovers out there pretending to be off-roaders. Hell, you can get a toughened-up Nissan Rogue these days (and honestly, it's not half bad). But for the most part, adding grippier wheels and faux running boards to a crossover does not an off-roader make.
Ford at least put some effort into the new Mach-E Rally. It has a 1.0-inch lift, optimized springs, genuine underbody protection, and a pretty nifty body kit to boot. Tack on the Mach-E GT's powerful output and you've got yourself a genuinely fun little off-road EV.
With two electric motors and a 91.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the Mach-E Rally has 480 horsepower and a whopping 700 pound-feet of torque. Alongside the GT, it's the most powerful Mach-E money can buy—hell, it's one of the torquiest EVs on sale anywhere today.
Tick over to the Mach-E’s “Unbridled” powertrain mode to uncork all 700 lb-ft. A huge wave of electrons launch the rally-ready SUV to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds—just a tenth of a second slower than the standard GT—and on to a limited top speed of 128 mph. It's quick as heck. There's even a faux acceleration sound that's pretty convincing at speed (it sounds like a rumbly V-6).
Ford tweaked the suspension specifically for off-road use. But that also means the Mach-E Rally is plenty compliant on pavement, too. Standard MagneRide shocks, slightly softer dampers, and tweaks to the anti-roll bars and bushings give it a more pliable yet still compliant ride.
There's a titch more body roll when you flick this Mach-E hard into a turn compared to other trims in the model range, presumably from the added ride height. But it handles well otherwise. It has ample body control, excellent balance, and a light but responsive steering feel.
There is some tire noise from the chunkier Michelin CrossClimate2 all-seasons, especially at highway speeds. And that massive rally-style wing makes rearward visibility a thing of the past. But who cares, this thing was made for rallying.
Since I'm about 5,000 miles and an ocean away from Col de Turini, a dinky dirt road is the next-best option. Step one is to dig into the touchscreen (mildly annoying) and select the RallySport drive mode, made specifically for the Mach-E Rally. Activating this mode smooths out the throttle response—instead of an instant shove of torque, power arrives in a more linear way. This mode also softens the dampers and relaxes the traction control just enough to allow you to rip off some sweet dirt drifts. If you really want to get wacky, you can disengage traction control entirely.
Even on this tight dirt road with a few tiny corners, the Mach-E Rally is an absolute hoot. Prod the throttle and yank the steering wheel hard to send the back end into a tidy, refined drift. Get up to speed and the softened suspension skips over rocks and powers through ruts like a genuine rally car, while the chunkier rubber claws its way through the dirt.
There's a bit of cladding on the fenders and side sills to protect it from kicked-up rubble, and a film on the doors helps to save the paint. There's even genuine underbody protection in the form of two panels, front and rear.
The one downside is that the Mach-E Rally doesn't have a limited-slip differential. Instead, it uses brake-based torque vectoring, which is less predictable and harder on the rotors. For the 95 percent of owners who won't take this thing to an actual rally stage, it's no big issue. But for the slim majority who might actually aim this car down a logging road in earnest, you'll have to live without that one key feature.
Otherwise, Ford made a genuinely compelling Mach-E rally car. And it still has all the things that make the standard Mach-E such a great electric SUV.
The extended-range battery comes standard on the Rally model, which gives it 265 miles on a single charge. Plugging into a 150-kilowatt DC fast charger refills it in just over 35 minutes, and there's a one-pedal mode for ultra-efficient driving.
The interior feels premium and airy, with high-end materials almost everywhere you look (apart from a chintzy-feeling rotary shift controller). The Rally model adds gloss white accents on the steering wheel and dash, and a unique trapezoidal pattern shared with the exterior. And love it or hate it, you get the same 15.5 vertical touchscreen found on other Mach-Es with functions like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. It even has BlueCruise hands-free highway driving (a $2,100 option with a three-year subscription).
Not to mention the Mach-E Rally just looks cool as hell. The 19-inch rally-inspired white wheels fit the personality of the car perfectly, the custom grille with two integrated fog lights further hammers home the rally theme, and that massive rear wing looks awesome, which Ford says was inspired by the Focus RS. My test car had two slick racing stripes down the middle with that same trapezoidal pattern from the cabin, though unfortunately, an uninspired Glacier Gray paint job. Go for one of the good colors; Grabber Blue, Grabber Yellow, or Eruption Green.
With a starting price of $60,990 and an as-tested price of $65,485, it’s definitely not the cheapest performance crossover out there ($55,890 for the Mach-E GT AWD and the Rally trim is another $6,000 on top of that). But while I was expecting another warmed-over soft-roader, the Mustang Mach-E Rally was genuinely impressive and thoroughly charming.
See, electric SUVs can be fun.

Aptera Needs Your Money To Bring Its Solar EV To The Market–Again,https://insideevs.com/news/743053/aptera-crowdfunding-campaign-again-production/,The American startup needs roughly $60 million to get the first production units off the assembly line.,2024-12-03 08:00:10,"Aptera, the California-based startup working on a solar-powered three-wheeled electric vehicle, has re-opened its crowdfunding campaign to finish development and start assembling production-ready units. The move comes after the previous campaign ended in May with a rather impressive tally: $135 million raised from 19,000 investors.
But as other startups have learned, sometimes the hard way–cue the Fisker story–making a car from scratch is very expensive. In Aptera’s case, it needs an additional $60 million or so to make its two-seater solar EV a finished product that people can actually buy.
As per Aptera, those interested in investing in the startup can do so with a minimum sum of $1,000. This will buy shares in the startup, with each share priced at $14.80, according to the solar EV maker.
More Aptera Stories
The up-and-coming entity is currently testing its first production-intent prototype that uses a different electric motor compared to previous prototypes. The electric three-wheeler was initially supposed to be powered by a hub motor at the rear but the newest iteration of the mule has an inboard drive unit made by Vitesco Technologies. The change was made because the hub motor wouldn’t have been ready in time for the start of production, Aptera said.
But when is the solar EV going into production? The latest estimate from the startup says that will happen sometime next year, with an initial run of around 7,000 units. That all hinges on whether or not Aptera can convince enough people to give it $60 million, though. So far, it has made a handful of prototypes and a lot of promises.
On paper, the solar-powered three-wheeler sounds like an ideal commuter. With small solar panels covering the entire body, Aptera claims the EV can gain up to 11,000 miles of range per year from harnessing the sun’s energy alone. That’s around 30 miles per day in ideal conditions. If it’s cloudy, raining or snowing, that figure will certainly be lower, but owners can still recharge the batteries as a conventional EV. In total, the Aptera SEV can go up to 400 miles on a full charge, as per the manufacturer.
Estimated pricing is between $25,900 and $48,300 depending on the number of solar panels on the body, battery size and powertrain configuration.",Iulian Dnistran
Ford Puma Gen-E: Mustang Mach-E’s Little Brother With Up To 233 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/742709/ford-puma-gen-e-electric-specs-range-battery/,The electric crossover is smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV.,2024-12-03 04:30:00,"The well-known Ford Mustang Mach-E electric crossover now has a little brother–in Europe, at least. Meet the new Ford Puma Gen-E, a battery-powered subcompact crossover that’s smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV but somehow has a bigger trunk than some large SUVs.
Measuring 165.9 inches long and 71 inches wide and with a wheelbase of 101.8 inches, the new Puma Gen-E is roughly 4 inches shorter than the Bolt EUV and the smallest electric vehicle in Ford’s European portfolio. The combustion-powered Puma is the automaker’s best-seller in Europe, and with the introduction of the electric version, Ford is hoping it can turn the tide that forced it to idle its flagship EV factory in Cologne due to poor demand for the Explorer EV and Capri.
Set to be built at its factory in Romania, the Ford Puma Gen-E is available with a single battery version–a 43-kilowatt-hour (usable) lithium ion pack with nickel manganese cobalt chemistry. On the four-door crossover, it can deliver a combined WLTP-rated range of up to 233 miles. The maximum DC fast charging speed is 100 kW, and it takes a little over 23 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% state of charge. Ford did not say how much power the on-board AC charger can accept or how long a top-up on a Level 2 charger would take.
Two trim levels will be on offer, but a single powertrain is available–a front-mounted single electric motor making 165 horsepower and 214 pound-feet of torque. It takes eight seconds for the Puma Gen-E to accelerate from a standstill to 62 miles per hour. That’s nearly as fast as the sporty, gas-powered Puma ST which needs 7.4 seconds to reach 62 mph.
Design-wise, the electric Puma is very similar to its dinosaur juice-powered siblings. The biggest difference is the Mustang Mach-E-like front “shield” design. Different alloy wheels and a sporty rear spoiler complete the picture.
Inside, there’s a pair of screens–a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen running Ford’s latest Sync 4 system and a 12.8-inch digital instrument cluster. Both come as standard, as does the wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.
More Stuff Like This
One thing that set the gas-powered Puma apart from its rivals was the clever use of space, particularly in the trunk, where the so-called MegaBox adds 2.8 cubic feet of cargo space under the floor. Well, in the Puma Gen-E, that under-floor storage is even bigger, as the name GigaBox would suggest. In total, the electric Puma has a cargo volume of 20.2 cubic feet, with the GigaBox accounting for 5.1 cubic feet. There’s also a 1.5 cubic feet front trunk that seems more like an afterthought than anything else.
The base model comes with 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, cruise control, a six-speaker audio system, heated door mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, ambient lighting, Amazon Alexa and four-way adjustable front seats. The Premium trim adds a B&O Play sound system with ten speakers, keyless entry, a hands-free tailgate, 18-inch wheels and Dynamic Matrix LED headlights with Glare-Free High Beam. Intelligent adaptive cruise control with stop & go and lane centering, as well as cross-traffic alert and a 360-degree camera system are optional.
The Ford Puma Gen-E will go on sale in Europe in the first part of next year. Pricing has not been announced yet.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Line Workers Told To Stay Home: ‘No Need To Report To Work’,https://insideevs.com/news/743007/tesla-cybertruck-assembly/,It looks like there’s a demand problem for the electric pickup that allegedly had millions of reservations before going on sale.,2024-12-03 03:42:27,"The Tesla Cybertruck is arguably the most controversial new vehicle on the market–five years after it was initially shown to the public in prototype form. Some love it, others hate it, but one thing is clear: you’ll be noticed on the road if you happen to be inside a Cybertruck.
It’s an attention-grabbing machine, and its sales success has so far been undeniable. It managed to climb to the top of the best-selling electric pickups chart in the second quarter in the United States, surpassing the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning, both of which have been on sale for longer.
But the initial boost seems to be drying out. Yesterday, workers at Tesla’s Austin factory, which assembles the Cybertruck, were told to stay home for the next three days, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. ""On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week (Dec. 3-5), you do not need to report to work,"" the memo said.
More Cybertruck Stuff
Workers were told to report back to work on Friday and that they would still be paid for the three days that they were supposed to work. Tesla doesn’t reply to questions from the media, so there’s no way of confirming if this is related to a demand problem or something else. Some workers would not follow the adjusted schedule and would be notified separately, the memo said.
However, factory workers on the Cybertruck line have occasionally been given other duties instead of building trucks since late October, according to Business Insider. Four workers said they had inconsistent schedules in the past month, either because they were sent home or given additional training exercises or cleaning duties instead of regular duties.
""When I started at Tesla you could expect to get overtime pay, now I feel lucky to get 40 hours,"" one worker on the Cybertruck line said.
Back in April, Tesla shortened the shifts for workers on the Cybertruck production line in Austin, Texas, as per a memo seen by Business Insider. Then, in October, the automaker started deliveries of the non-Foundation Series models–which are at least $20,000 cheaper than the limited-edition models that were the first to ship.
Fast-forward a few weeks and the alleged multi-year backlog of orders appears to have dried out in just a few months, with Tesla inviting reservation holders who pre-ordered as late as 2023 to get their trucks.
In total, fewer than 30,000 Cybertrucks were sold and registered in the United States in the first nine months, according to data from Cox Automotive and Kelley Blue Book. In the first two quarters combined, 11,558 Cybertrucks were sold in the U.S., with the third quarter marking 16,692 registrations. The numbers are on the rise, so it will be very interesting to see what will happen in the last quarter–will the numbers go up or down? By the looks of it, Tesla managed to ramp up production significantly in the previous quarter, but if fewer people want the angular pickup, it makes sense to tone down the assembly line pace to avoid filling delivery centers with inventory.",Iulian Dnistran
Jaguar’s Electric Comeback Is Big And Bold. But Time Is Running Out,https://insideevs.com/news/742967/jaguar-type-00-business/,"The Jaguar Type 00 Concept is a $120,000 bold bet on EV power, but this brand is already on its ninth life. Can it pull off a comeback?",2024-12-02 20:10:00,"Jaguar’s title sponsorship of Miami Art Week featured its own blank canvas in the Type 00, a concept car the brand hopes will spawn some electric masterpieces beginning in 2026. Its design is remarkably striking, easily the most interesting thing Jaguar has done in years.
But design is one thing; making a business out of it is another, and Jaguar is running out of time.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The Miami venue underscored the brand’s intention to collaborate with artists, who aren’t known for buying roughly $120,000 EVs; but also to market to wealthy coastal types who might. Forget the gray U.K. or a gritty Detroit in January—that’s so 1960s. Forget British punters crying in their Guinness over classic E-Types. They’re ambivalent at best toward EVs, and probably can’t afford these cars anyway. JLR estimates only 10 to 15% of current customers will come along for the ride.
That brings us to the first of Jaguar’s problems and possibly the ninth of its lives: lately, Jaguar hasn’t had many customers at all. The brand sold 8,348 cars in America in 2023, down nearly 80 percent since 2017, and about 64,000 worldwide. Mercedes and BMW each sold about 40 times that many cars in the U.S. Its current lineup, if you can even call it that, is just holdovers from the previous decade like the once-groundbreaking but now irrelevant electric I-Pace.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
As company executives note, that has proven the folly of butting heads with BMW, Benz or even Genesis in the mass-luxury ranks. Blame whatever you like, a dodgy quality reputation, anodyne designs, a revolving door of ownership and strategies. That includes balling and tossing a near-completed electric XJ design, and $634 million with it.
These are valid diagnoses of an ailing brand. But I prefer a swipe with Occam’s Razor: Jaguar is a sedan and sports-car specialist in a world that has turned its back on sedans and sports cars. And Range Rover has the SUV-heritage-thing wrapped up, leaving scraps for its starveling sister.
Jaguar’s good old days are over, and its internal-combustion ways weren’t working. So the brand will shutter its factories, pretend 2025 isn’t a thing, and start fresh in 2026. Type 00 might refer to the revenues Jaguar will generate between now and then.
More seriously, U.S. dealers, their count already reduced to 120, will spend at least 12 months unloading a staggered inventory of leftovers, including the excellent but oft-overlooked F-Pace SUV. You think you’re peeved about Jaguar’s reimagining? I’m sure those long-suffering franchisees love to hear Jaguar tout posh new in-house stores to offer “immersive steps into the world of the Jaguar brand.” This red-hot industry trend, whose failures include a now-shuttered Cadillac House in Manhattan, has shown little to no evidence of boosting sales or brand image.
But at its Gaydon design studios, where I saw the Type 00 prior to the Miami reveal, Jaguar showed a rendering of a future store design: More shelter-magazine fantasy than traditional dealership, complete with a dramatic spiral staircase. Jaguar plans to open the first of these brand showcases in Paris’ “Golden Triangle” luxury-fashion district in the 8th arrondissement.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The question lingers: How many Parisians, Persians or Philadelphians will spend six figures on an electric Jaguar? As Rawdon Glover, managing director, confirmed in an interview, the brand plans to boost average transaction prices from today’s $60,000 to roughly $120,000.
Considering today’s option-stuffed luxury models, that to me suggests base prices closer to $100,000, which I believe Jaguar had better be targeting through ruthlessly disciplined design, supplier deals, and resource sharing. Much higher than that, and the air gets thin and customers are finicky and scarce—especially for an underdog like Jaguar.
Plot an industry sales chart based on prices, and you’ll be struck by how new-car sales tumble off a cliff above $100,000. That surprisingly small niche of buyers tends to head straight to blue-chip ICE perennials, your Porsche 911s, Mercedes G-Classes and S-Classes, a few BMWs. Oh, and Range Rovers.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Normally, if people don’t want your $60,000 cars, shooting for $120,000 sounds like madness. But these aren’t normal times. Like many legacy brands, Jaguar rightly sees its current fossil-fueled path as a dead-end. If you’re going to go down, you might as well go down swinging, with three chances to hit a home run or even a bloop single. The strategy appears simultaneously desperate, smart and necessary. The entire industry, including mainstream GM and Ford, has figured out it’s better to build fewer cars and charge much more for them, rather than go broke chasing volume and market share.
So Jaguar will aim for just 50,000 global sales, a fraction of the roughly 130,000 it sold under Ford’s high-volume auspices in 2002. Glover believes Jaguar can make money at those volumes, and finally carry its weight within JLR.
If Jaguar has a trump card, it’s Gerry McGovern, and his status as likely the industry’s most successful contemporary luxury designer and turnaround artist. McGovern basically hit reset on Land Rover after its own years in the wilderness. When you see people routinely paying $200,000 and more for top Range Rovers; and their sleek convoys on shows like Succession that have become a stereotypical visual shorthand for wealth and power, you can thank McGovern. Now running the entire JLR design show from a tastefully curated office in Gaydon, McGovern won’t be getting his hands dirty with Jaguar clay models, but nothing will reach showrooms without his signoff. And considering McGovern’s track record, I’m not ready to bet against him.
For all that, Jaguar may still be leaping from frying pan to fire.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
I can’t shake a suspicion that Jaguar is trying to locate an imaginary slice of the market where competition doesn’t exist, or will curl up in a ball when faced with Jaguar’s (purportedly) superior designs. When I asked Glover to name the brands or models Jaguar was benchmarking or viewed as rivals, he demurred; saying Jaguar had often spent too much time worrying about the competition and was better off playing its own confident game. Fair enough.
Yet at Gaydon, Glover and other execs took plenty of broad shots at today’s luxury EVs as being generic, cab-forward transportation pods, designed to satisfy wind tunnels rather than discerning eyes. (I’d say “Looking at you, Mercedes,” but I’m not telling them anything they don’t already know.)
In contrast, Jaguar’s distinctive, design-led models would stand out and carry the day. But even recently, Jaguar often boasted the sexiest cars in various segments—the XJ sedan, the F-Type sports car and F-Pace SUV—and a fat lot of good it did them. Jaguar needs to bring the performance, tech, quality, everything, and not just show up at the party with the sharpest suit and prettiest bouquet.
If Jaguar won’t breathe a few Voldemort names, I will: Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lucid to start. All of those brands, I humbly submit, have managed distinctive EV designs of their own. Then there’s Tesla, which will flip you a Model S Plaid for $89,900. The Tesla may not be as swanky as a future Jaguar, but it’s got 1,020 horsepower, will cost roughly $30,000 less.
And there are signs that the uber-wealthy would rather pay for the privilege of internal combustion.
Global sales of the Porsche Taycan, a benchmark luxury EV, have tumbled a whopping 50% in 2024, though the heavily updated 2025 models aren’t out in force yet. Mercedes’ EQS sedan, with base prices ranging from about $105,000 to $129,000, has failed to win over traditional Mercedes ICE customers or conquest new ones. Despite stellar performance and industry-leading range and efficiency, Lucid’s Air has not done what the Model S did for Tesla. If Porsche, Mercedes and Lucid are struggling in the EV stratosphere, what chance does Jaguar have?
Other nagging questions include the brand’s ability to make money with a standalone Jaguar Electric Architecture. Can Jaguar sell enough cars and share enough components with Range Rover to balance the books and justify that investment?
Jaguar is also failing to take a lesson from Lucid’s gravest mistake, which was coming to market with a sedan first and not a higher-volume SUV. Akin to Lucid, Jaguar says its sedan-shaped GT will establish a design language and underscore its electric bona fides. But Americans especially don’t care about high-minded philosophies; they just want SUVs.
To the good: Jaguar may be out of cars for now, but it’s not out of money, engineering and resources. And nearly every EV purveyor, legacy or start-up, is currently struggling to make a go of it. Lucid and Rivian have yet to earn a profit, and are burning through billions of dollars each quarter, with the Saudis and Amazon/Ford as their respective key financial patrons. At Ford, the F-Series is the real sugar daddy, that bankrolls and offsets an EV operation that’s losing billions.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar’s deep-pocketed patron is Tata Group, India’s mightiest conglomerate.  JLR itself posted record revenues of $36.3 billion in the last fiscal year. JLR’s $2.75 billion in profit is its highest since 2015. Wait, actual profits? Lucid’s Peter Rawlinson and Rivian’s RJ Scaringe would pop champagne at the very thought. Sure, Land Rover generates roughly 100 percent of those earnings. But Land Rover has been carrying Jaguar like a sickly kitten since Ford sold both brands to Tata 16 years ago. What’s a few more?
Finally, the Jaguar name still carries more recognition than any start-up. Among laypeople, I hear this all the time: What’s a Rivian? Lucid, you say? But people know Jaguar, for better or worse. Their doctor or neighbor once drove one. A mechanic told them they should never buy one. In this brand-obsessed culture, that three-syllable name—redolent of classic cars, fragrant leather, British royals, the gentrified good life—still has potential value. If this revival fails, I can see the brand being sold to a Chinese automaker just as BMW bought Britain’s foundering Rover Group in 1994, then broke it up and sold the Land Rover portion to Ford in 2000.
Something else is being overlooked. Jaguar appears on track to become the world’s first legacy luxury brand with an all-electric lineup, even as others backpedal from promises. For people who support EVs and the fight against climate change, wasn’t that the idea all along? So let’s go easy on the hot-pink outrage, reserve judgment for now, and maybe hope that this once-glorious brand can thrive again.
Jaguar’s electric transformation does appear to be the ultimate Hail Mary play. But teams draw it up for a reason: Every once in a while, it works.

Jaguar Has Your Attention. Now The Type 00 Aims To Hit Reset,https://insideevs.com/news/742957/jaguar-type-00-design/,"Jag's next move may be the inflection point for an EV renaissance, with at least 430 miles of range and 575 hp. Or an epitaph.",2024-12-02 20:00:00,"Mission accomplished, Jaguar. You have our attention. Along with that of Stephen Colbert, the gay-panic shit-stirrers at Fox News, X-man Elon and every hot-take purveyor from London to Los Angeles.
I’m referring to the, um, “Exuberant” rebranding of this famed-yet-foundering British luxury automaker; complete with expressionless models whose ruched-and-ruffled attire and lunar-pink backdrop seemed equal parts Teletubbies and Dune. “Does Jaguar sell ketamine now?” Colbert quipped, noting the ad’s Infiniti-esque absence of cars.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Well, cue the EDM from Miami, because this brand isn’t through with provoking, or the color pink. Jaguar chose the city’s Art Week to unveil an actual car, the Type 00—a concept design statement that history may record as the inflection point for Jaguar’s EV renaissance. Or an epitaph.
The initial rebranding struck so many observers as Category 5 corporate wankery. But perspective, people: Almost nobody buys, or doesn’t buy, a car based on advertising. If they did, Volkswagen would rule America, and Lexus wouldn’t sell any cars until December. Tesla doesn’t even advertise, unless you consider Musk a walking advertisement. Which is certainly going well.
In the words of Gerry McGovern, JLR’s creative director, “Product is God.” And Jaguar does need a miracle. But it’s a long way between now and 2026 when the first of a planned three-car electric lineup goes on sale. Pouring a glass half-full, that’s bankrolled by Jaguar’s share of $19 billion from owner Tata Motors, in planned EV and autonomous investment in Jaguar and Land Rover over five years. With green capital drying up elsewhere, it’s the kind of money any EV start-up would kill for.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept

Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar says the Type 00 name alludes to zero emissions and a fresh start for an 89-year-old brand that once symbolized the best of British design. It’s a brawny two-seat fastback with faint echoes of those golden years, including a swept roofline, a boattail rear and a hood long enough to house a V-12, rather than a petite electric motor. As intended, this coupe appears carved from a single block of granite, albeit one with little room to spare for miniature windows. A freight-train front end recalls Audi’s original single-frame grilles, minus conventional openings.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The look is one part Streamline Moderne, one part armored vehicle. It's like a brutalist take on the Rolls-Royce Spectre, at barely one-quarter the price, minus the Rolls' traditional grille and graceful curvature.  But the exterior also looks unfinished, like a rough design sketch that’s come to life. Dramatic butterfly doors and three brass rails inside—including a 10.5-footer that splits the cabin between floating seats—clearly aren’t meant for production.
Then again, the screens that rise theatrically from the dash appear doable. A new Leaper logo is laser-etched onto brass fender “ingots” that deploy to expose rear-facing cameras. Gorgeous travertine stone inlays might win over buyers all on their own. Too bad the natural stone appears unfeasible: It’s the kind of bravura element that could back up Jaguar’s “Copy Nothing” mantra that traces to founder William Lyons.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The Type 00 does take an opaque page from the Polestar 4: There’s no rear window, rather a “glassless tailgate” and a camera-based rearview mirror. That offputting gimmick—something nobody ever wanted—appears headed to the first production car inspired by this concept, a four-seat, roughly $120,000 GT. You’re not going to make this easy, are you Jaguar?
Under-the-skin details remain scarce for that production model, beyond an 800-volt architecture and what Jaguar claims will deliver 430 miles of range on the EPA testing cycle. Jaguar has said it will be its most powerful road car ever, so we’re expecting output to top 575 horsepower. That GT is to be followed by an SUV in some form because they actually need to make some sales here, plus an electric super sedan that sounds like a more affordable Bentley Flying Spur or Rolls-Royce Ghost.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
To its credit, the Type 00 looks expensive, anchored by 23-inch wheels. But alluring roofline aside, it’s not traditionally “pretty,” lithe or elegant like Jags of old. And its blunt-force proportions and design pretensions will surely spark another round of handwringing from the easily outraged.
That includes the Type 00’s dusky shade of “Miami Pink” that I admired in November at JLR’s Gaydon, U.K. headquarters, during a hush-hush media showing prior to the official reveal. The rosy paint was a highlight for this careless coupe, seemingly designed for modern-day Daisy Buchanans to mow down peasants/pedestrians. In Miami’s Design District, Jaguar paired the pink car with a “London Blue” specimen.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
A literal whiff of fashionista does follow the “Prism,” a kind of magic handbag that tucks into the bodyside, behind a powered door panel. The Prism contains three “totems”—wedges of Alabaster, Travertine and Brass—that slot into the console to summon various moods in ambient lighting, soundscapes or bespoke fragrances. Silly? A bit. But for decades, these kinds of playful flourishes have been par for the concept course.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Screen animations use chiaroscuro, mixing light and shadow to suggest three-dimensional objects. Jaguar’s new “strikethrough” design hallmark traces front and rear ends, and tops a striking peekaboo roof that appears solid at first glance. Think a Venetian blind with gracefully thin slats.
Even if the initial rebranding exercise was the equivalent of two torn hamstrings, Jaguar has captured its biggest mindshare in years. With all eyes on Jaguar, expect some auto writers and armchair critics to continue the gleeful pile-on, and declare the Type 00 more evidence of a brand and electric transformation gone awry.
But concept cars don’t work that way. So many concepts or design elements that were declared “radical” or ridiculed, from those Audi front ends to BMW’s X6 “SUV coupe”, were soon accepted or even beloved by actual buyers. They became commonplace or spawned myriad imitators. Looking back, you wonder what the original fuss was all about.
So if you were expecting a definitive answer as to whether Jaguar can design its way out of trouble, the Type 00 is not it. We’ll all need to wait until this polarizing concept and design language evolves into showroom form. Jaguar plans to reveal that GT late next year and build it in the UK sometime in 2026. Then wealthy EV prospects, not Jaguar’s critics, will have the final say.

"Tesla's FSD Can Finally Park, Though Sometimes It Aims For The Sidewalk",https://insideevs.com/news/742973/tesla-fsd-new-version-improvements/,"Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" system can now back out of and find a parking spot, but it's far from flawless.",2024-12-02 18:06:53,"We’ve been covering Tesla Full Self-Driving since it was launched in October 2020. In the four years since we’ve seen it both working perfectly and failing, but true full self-driving with no safety driver just seemed distant. The latest version of FSD changes that, though, and it finally makes true driverless cars seem possible.
There have always been big claims made by Elon Musk about FSD and its capabilities, but the rate at which it was progressing made some of these statements seem exaggerated. What made us question FSD was Tesla’s decision to make the system only work on a combination of cameras and neural networks, ditching other types of sensors and radar.
FSD version 13.2 is a big improvement over version 12. It not only makes the autonomous driving better and smoother, but it also adds new features. You can now enable FSD while the car is in Park, and it will reverse out of the parking spot for you and begin its journey to your set destination where it will find a suitable spot to park itself.
Dirty Tesla drove around in his Model Y running FSD V13.2, and it worked well on the driving portion. But at its destination, the vehicle attempted to park on a sidewalk ramp. It looked big enough for a car to fit, in its defense, though it's hard to imagine a human making that mistake. However, that was one of the very few times when the FSD disengaged or the driver had to intervene. Still, it highlights a big problem for automated parking: Knowing where the car will fit is one thing, but knowing where it can legally park is an entirely different issue. It may be a long time before a Tesla can sort out what a loading zone is, what permit parking means, what permits it has and what spots are time-restricted.
It also failed to find a proper parking spot after the sidewalk situation, but its ability to navigate the parking lot is still impressive. It even had to squeeze through a tight gap between a parked car and a building, and it made it look easy. Don’t forget this is a car with no ultrasonic sensors to gauge distance, which only makes its performance more impressive. Though you can see why many automakers do use them.
One of the big changes with V13.2 is that it uses higher-resolution feeds from the exterior cameras, which also run at a higher refresh rate. This allows the AI model that underpins FSD to run faster, helped by the new Cortex supercomputer at Giga Texas, which is five times quicker at computing data compared to the older supercomputer called Dojo.
Another video where Dirty Tesla tests FSD V13.2 highlights just how smooth it is with steering and brake application. Early versions would saw the wheel as they made turns, which didn’t instill confidence. But now it seems to be getting close to matching a human driver’s level of smoothness. Note, however, that early reviews of FSD systems tend to be more positive, as Tesla has been known to prioritize data access to those with friendlier approaches to the system.
Such a big improvement in FSD’s performance makes Tesla’s robotaxi plans seem more plausible. The manufacturer intends to begin production of its Cybercab sometime in 2026 or 2027. I was doubtful when I originally heard that timeline, and I'm still unsure now. But now that FSD has the ability to start and end drives on its own terms—even with notable errors—that future feels closer than ever.

BYD Plans On Going The Distance In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/742961/byd-distance-video-stella-li/,"An exclusive interview with our Italian counterpart revealed that the brand sees tariffs, and a slowing European market as mere temporary setbacks.",2024-12-02 16:00:44,"BYD’s on everyone's lips now, and that’s a fact. This Chinese automaker once only made poorly-made gas-powered clones of Japanese sedans, pivoted to plug-in vehicles. Now, roughly 15 years later, BYD is one of the largest vehicle brands on the planet. Its plug-in vehicles are a stone’s throw away from catching Tesla in China, but it’s also been making huge inroads in Europe, despite pushback from EU tariffs meant to stifle Chinese brands from undercutting Europe’s own EV efforts.
Still, BYD’s pushing forward, and we’ve got some more information as to just how BYD itself might feel both about China and as it expands outward into other markets.
Stella Li, the Vice President of BYD Global, sat down with our colleague Alessandro Lago, Motorsport Network’s Automotive Editorial Director for Europe. The two had a wide-ranging 30-minute chat the brand’s successes, its headwinds in the global market, where it plans to go next and whether people are ready for electric vehicles.
“If you’re not prepared for long-term investment in Europe, you should never come to Europe. It’s not simple. It’s super challenging. It’s super competitive,” Li said.
Li said she certainly feels that the world is increasingly ready for electrification. Globally, BYD holds 23% of all of the world’s plug-in vehicle market (often called NEV, or New Energy Vehicles), which Li says is double the percentage of its next closest rival. Of course, that’s a stunning achievement, but Li also insists that the popularity of BYD’s models points to a market willingness for EVs and PHEVs. Thus, its successes at home have emboldened harder to push more into Europe.
BYD Seal U
One of those pushes includes BYD’s forthcoming Seal U PHEV crossover. This car, already on sale in China as the BYD Song Plus, is set to come to many European markets, slotting in as a crossover counterpart to the Seal EV sedan. Li says the Seal U will have at least 80 kilometers (50 miles) of full EV range, which she thinks will be a game-changer for Europeans, and be the start of BYD boosting its sales in Europe.
“I think you’ll see a big change in the European market,” Li said. Still, despite BYD making inroads, Li admitted that there aren’t enough dealers and aftersales service centers for the models in continental Europe, and it needs to build more. For example, BYD only has 20 stores in Italy—but it plans on having 105 dealerships in Italy by the end of next year.
Those sound like a lot of stores, especially since in some cases the EV infrastructure and revolution is faltering as of late. Sales can be interpreted as slowing. Legacy brands like Volkswagen, Ford and Fiat have been very open about slow-selling EVs hurting profitability and are the reason for shuttering factories.
Li says this is only temporary. In fact, the lull is pretty natural. “When you’re pushing a new technology, growth is fast growing, but then you’ll pause—[demand] will snap back,” Li said.
She also thinks that confusing messaging from legacy EU brands and government, some of which have reneged on their promises to move 100% electrification, have hurt sales. Add in high energy costs in some EU member states, and there’s a perfect storm for EV sales to lull in Europe despite the potential to market willingness.
BYD is dedicated to Europe, even the EU and China tariff spat will likely be resolved soon, and collaboration will continue. BYD’s European production plans (like its factory soon to open in Hungary) will continue.

"Fisker Ocean Owner Review: $69,012 To $13,500 In One Year",https://insideevs.com/news/742945/fisker-ocean-owner-review-depreciation/,"Fisker owners have to deal with massive financial losses, an unfinished car and plenty of unfulfilled promises.",2024-12-02 15:00:25,"Edmunds just wrapped up a 10-month test of the Fisker Ocean, and boy was it expensive. The auto buying site purchased the top-trim Ocean for $69,012. After 10 months that included Fisker filing for bankruptcy, the car is now worth $13,500. That hurts.
Watching Edmunds' latest video on the Fisker, it's not hard to see why. The brand's editors describe a litany of issues that they assumed would get better over time. But with Fisker now effectively defunct, there's little hope it'll get any better. With almost no spare parts out there and only a crowdsourced patchwork of support options, it may actually get worse.
That's tough when starting from such a low baseline. From the beginning, the Ocean has struggled to detect its keyfob. Senior Reviews Editor Brian Wong says it frequently fails to recognize an unlock command even after holding the button for 15-20 seconds. The car also occasionally won't detect the key once he gets inside, and it won't start until the issue resolves itself. Staffers couldn't carry a backup key, either, as the Ocean only came with one fob. The company promised that a mobile app was on the way to provide an alternative access method, but it never did. Now, it never will. There are plenty of other software issues that Edmunds editors and buyers alike were expecting to get fixed.
""We were really counting on those updates to sort of fix those things as we went along,"" Wong said.

The car still rolls backwards on hills when you let off the brake, he said. It was supposed to have a hill start function from the get-go. But it never worked. Fisker said an auto-brake-hold function was coming in software version 2.0, but Edmunds' vehicle never got it. Editors also complained of a laggy, low-resolution backup camera. There was enough of a delay that you might not see an object before you hit it, one staffer noted.
It wasn't all bad news, though. The Fisker looks good and rides well, with an exceptional maximum range. In Edmunds' range test, the Ocean delivered 358 miles of range in mixed city/highway conditions. That's fantastic for a mid-size electric SUV. Plus, people loved the California mode, which allows you to drop all of the glass behind the windshield, including the panoramic roof, the small window behind the C pillar and the rear glass. I often see a Fisker Ocean at my local surf break in California mode, with a surfboard sticking out of the back. The advertisement writes itself.
But unfortunately, there's no one left to buy an ad spot. Fisker is bankrupt, leaving its owners in the lurch. Edmunds took an 80% hit on this car, losing $55,512 in less than a year. The company buys these cars to get a true ownership experience. For Fisker owners, there's only one way to describe it: Brutal.

A Tesla Gets Much Better With These Stick-On Stalks,https://insideevs.com/news/742935/tesla-stick-on-stalks/,"Hardly anybody thinks Tesla giving up on indicator and wiper stalks is a good idea, but now there’s an aftermarket fix.",2024-12-02 13:03:32,"When I drove the refreshed Tesla Model 3, I was impressed with its blend of qualities and the improvements it had over the pre-facelift model. However, not all changes were for the better, and Tesla removing the stalks from behind the steering wheel was cause for some initial frustration.
The revised Model 3 no longer has indicator and wiper stalks behind the steering wheel. The Model S and Model X haven’t had stalks since 2021; the Cybertruck never even had them. All the controls that were previously accessed via the stalks have now been moved to either the steering wheel or the touchscreen. This includes turn signals, lights, wipers and gear selection. (Thankfully, the ultra-popular Model Y keeps them, at least for now.)
The turn signals are two buttons on the left spoke of the steering wheel stacked one on top of the other. Using them takes more thought than it should, especially when you need to indicate when the wheel isn’t centered. Tesla also forces users to put the car in drive or reverse by swiping on the screen, and while this isn’t as annoying as not having an indicator stalk, it’s not great.
One way around this would be to retrofit the stalks from an older Tesla, but they don’t look right (they stick out too much), and you need extensive modifications to make them work. That’s why a solution like the S3XY stalks by Enhance seems ideal for Model 3 owners who miss having stalks and who don’t want to start taking the car apart (and risk voiding the warranty) to get physical stalks to work.
Tesla Stalks Aftermarket
You just stick them on the sides of the steering column, and they communicate wirelessly to a command module that is hooked into the car’s OBD port. If you just want the left or the right stalk, you can just have one or opt for the pair to get additional functions. You can customize what they do and even map shortcuts, choosing from 60 available actions, which differ depending on the model they’re installed on.
The pack containing the two stalks, the wireless command module, and the necessary wiring to make it work cost €409.69 ($429), and the company is currently offering 22% off for a limited time. It will begin shipping kits next year. The ones designed for the Model 3 will be shipped first, starting on Feb. 24, while those for the Model S and X (which are €20 more expensive) will begin shipping in late April.

Stellantis' CEO Is Gone Ahead Of 'A Big Year' With A Huge List Of Problems,https://insideevs.com/news/742900/tavares-stellantis-december-cm/,"Plus, a recent Mercedes fire changes South Korea's EV calculus, and can the Trump administration work with China's automakers?",2024-12-02 10:30:36,"I think now-former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares was an interesting figure for just how unpopular he was. Sure, very few top executives get to where they are by making friends everywhere they go. But Tavrares was somewhat unique in how much he managed to make everyone mad at him; the employees, the unions, the board members, the suppliers and the customers are all probably thrilled to see him go. That's almost a talent in and of itself.
But Tavares was also the chief architect behind Stellantis, the bizarre conglomerate formed in a merger of Fiat Chrysler with France's Groupe PSA. What that company and its 14 car brands even are without him is an open question, and it comes right ahead of a crucial year on many fronts—including the electric one.
That kicks off the first Critical Materials news roundup of December 2024. We at InsideEVs hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, if you observed it. Also on today's docket: a Mercedes-Benz EV fire forces some big changes in South Korea, and can President-elect Donald Trump ""open up"" China's EV sector?
Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO
It's hard to believe this, but we're not even four full years into the existence of the entity that is Stellantis, the cross-Atlantic holding company that owns Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Opel, Fiat and a bunch of other brands. That's a lot of mouths to feed; I'm not even sure it can be done. But now Tavares, the former CEO of the PSA Group, is completely out even before his planned early 2026 retirement.
Stellantis was formed on the idea that the car industry was facing a profound transformation the only way to survive it is through scale: combining the resources of these many brands to keep costs down and drive investments in the future. And maybe things would have gone differently if COVID-19 hadn't blown up the automotive supply chain and raised car prices, though Tavares' leadership is absolutely guilty of taking that and running with it.
In the end, Tavares' tenure was doomed on two fronts. He was dealing with the European auto crisis on his home turf—falling sales, increased competition from Chinese car brands and waning EV interest as subsidies vanished—and plummeting revenue in the lucrative North American market as people stopped buying these newly ultra-expensive Jeeps and Ram trucks. This side of the Atlantic paid more than half Stellantis' bills but Tavares' team was roundly accused of jacking up prices and starving Jeep and others of new products to fuel a renaissance for certain European brands like Alfa Romeo, which didn't work out, either. Now it's facing existential problems like plant closures, furious dealers and an unclear strategy for what's next. Profits were down nearly 50% this year as 2024 was set to be a kind of total write-off.
The thing is—and don't take this as a defense of Tavares, because I have no interest in constructing one—some positive changes were beginning to take shape. Jeep has a new CEO who's working to make its prices less unhinged and get new models on the road, and Stellantis is starting to show some real promise on the EV front after years of lagging behind. But in the end, it wasn't enough to save Tavares and he probably didn't deserve it anyway.
So now what? For one, there's the matter of succession. But as The Detroit News pointed out, Stellantis has a pretty thin bench these days; it witnessed a huge executive talent drain under Tavares and will be run by a committee in the interim, not an acting CEO. And Stellantis has a huge year ahead: it's supposed to launch the Dodge Charger EV, the electric Jeep Wagoneer S, the Ram 1500 Rev and Ramcharger EREV and more next year. That's just on the North American front; more are coming in Europe too. There are new EVs coming from Fiat, Peugeot, that deal with China's Leapmotor... a lot is going on right now.
From the News:
In North America, where revenue fell 42% in the third quarter and shipments were off 36%, it appears Stellantis has a ""decent plan"" for a turnaround, said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Inc.
""It's a matter of letting it play out,"" she said. ""They were making progress on adjusting pricing. They're making progress on not just making things cheaper, but trying to come up with a way to repackage and develop products that are giving consumers the right value.”
Next year, Stellantis needs to move forward with the several products it's launching — including high-profile EV offerings — and ensure those launches go as smoothly as possible, she said: “It's going to be a big year for them, and they need to have it go as smoothly as possible, and that means being able to handle whatever unexpected issues come up as well as possible.”
Good luck to whoever ends up in that job. They're going to need it.
Mercedes EQS
Here's the thing about lithium-ion battery fires: they're statistically far more rare than internal combustion vehicles, but far nastier to put out when they do happen. This is especially bad news in South Korea, a country with big EV ambitions but where most urban people live in high-rise towers. One Mercedes-Benz EV fire earlier this year (followed by another involving a Kia) has the country spooked about what could happen if these cars are parked underground. That Mercedes fire alone sent dozens of tower residents to the hospital and left 200 families temporarily homeless.
So now, according to Bloomberg, South Korea is making changes that the rest of the world should consider adopting:
The new set of regulations included mandating automakers disclose the brands of their batteries, expanding the scope of safety inspections for existing EVs and preventing vehicles from being fully charged.
The government has also directly stepped in to ensure the safety of batteries via a state-run certification system. The pilot project has been running since mid-October with five companies, including carmakers Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp. as well as cell manufacturer LG Energy Solution Ltd., participating.
[...] Before the initiative, EVs were sold in South Korea without any third-party safety tests. Under the new system, state-run agencies like the Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute will put batteries through their paces before installation, ensuring they meet government-backed safety certification standards.
Korea planted its flag early in the EV space and these days, it seems like every fourth or fifth car in Seoul is an electric Hyundai or Kia. The country doesn't want to back down after all those investments, so these should be seen as positive moves:
The Mercedes-Benz blaze was undoubtedly an unfortunate event, but it cast a much-needed spotlight on the issue and sparked calls for stricter regulations. Ultimately, it could serve as a wake-up call for South Korea to create a safer, more supportive environment for battery-powered cars.
Here's hoping.
Trump BYD Seagull
Meanwhile, back in the U.S., the auto industry and buyers like are on pins and needles as they wait to see if incoming President Donald Trump will really act to kill the EV tax credit or if he's inclined to find some way forward that won't threaten manufacturing jobs in purple and red states. But there's also the question of China's automakers—currently kept out of the U.S. by tariffs and software restrictions—and what role they could play domestically. Trump has said in the past that he'd rather they build cars in the U.S. than overseas: “If they want to build a plant in Michigan, in Ohio, in South Carolina, they can, using American workers,” he said in March.
That's undoubtedly a scary proposition if you're Ford, or General Motors, or Volkswagen, or heck, even Tesla. But Steve LeVine at The Information (subscription required) proposes that Chinese EVs could come stateside as part of a broader trade deal with the country:
Yet there is reason to expect that Trump—after starting with maximal threats, like a 60% tariff he has vowed to impose on all Chinese goods—will favor a grand trade bargain in which the establishment of Chinese EV and battery factories in the U.S. would be a central feature. In exchange for that and other sweeteners to lower the U.S.-China trade imbalance, Beijing would seek reduced tariffs.
The reason: Trump, while unpredictable and prone to reversing course, would rightly view the potential for billions of dollars in investment, thousands of jobs and an improbable diplomatic breakthrough as a dealmaking coup that would burnish his legacy. For his part, President Xi Jinping “wants Chinese companies to dominate global markets in EVs and batteries,” said Ian Bremmer, president of geopolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “Call it the Japanese model of the ’80s and ’90s. Global domination requires a global presence.”
So could this actually work out for the U.S.? In terms of upping its battery game, which badly needs to happen, the answer could be yes:
[...] the U.S. could unroll a welcome mat to Chinese factories a win as long as a company like BYD, China’s largest EV manufacturer, sourced most of its parts and materials from North America and shared its technical knowledge with his American employees. “I think it is in the interests of the U.S. to onshore the dominant Chinese EV maker,” he said. “An investment like this supports the build-out of an onshore EV ecosystem from critical minerals production and recycling to battery manufacturing and charging network development.”
But then again:
Now Trump has invited Chinese EV makers into the U.S., and part of that bargain would likely be that they share what they know with American rivals. “In a complete role reversal from the ’00s, when foreign [automakers] wishing to access the growing Chinese market were concerned about forced tech transfer, it is now Beijing at risk of inadvertently undermining its companies in international markets by helping competitors catch up,” said Bremmer, the Eurasia Group president.
The deal is likely to be only the beginning: CATL, Byd and other Chinese companies make most of the world’s LFP batteries, and U.S. LFP startups haven’t even begun to manufacture them. Depending on the arrangement Trump offers, CATL seems likely to seek other business in the U.S.—and to get a warm welcome from automakers seeking the cheapest and currently the best batteries. “The United States does not have [LFP] experts,” a CATL engineer said. “The Chinese industry can help build that local talent pool.”
That story's worth a read in full. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Big Oil also have Trump's ear more than most, so it's also hard to fathom he'll become deeply interested in competitive battery technology all of a sudden.
Ralph Gilles Stellantis Jeep Wagoneer S
I've always been a fan of Ralph Gilles, the Chrysler-Fiat Chrysler-SRT-Stellantis design guru who's as responsible as anyone for America's 21st-century muscle car renaissance (and gets where the EV market is going.) He's a smart guy. But he may be too smart to want to take on that many brands.
Who should get the top spot at Stellantis next, and what must they do to right the ship?

Rivian Was Inspired By Anime And ‘Optimism’ To Transform Car Controls,https://insideevs.com/news/742830/rivian-software-artwork-hammoud-interview/,In-car software looks awful. Rivian’s latest updates to the 2025 R1S and R1T fix that problem in a unique and even philosophical way.,2024-12-02 10:00:00,"As crucial as things like touchscreens and software are to the modern automotive experience, we seldom stop to ask why everything looks so ugly.
Your average car’s touchscreen and menus likely have all the functionality of a Palm Pre, with the aesthetic appeal and artistic value of a Fort Worth outlet mall. Their menus and controls often feel haphazardly designed and look utterly forgettable. This is true even after more than a decade of in-car screen dominance and a future we’re constantly told is centered around over-the-air updates and smartphone-like tech features.
So when Rivian set out to completely overhaul its in-car software experience, its designers declared that things don’t have to be this way.
The electric startup’s latest infotainment setup features cel-shaded depictions of its trucks and SUVs, offset by animated depictions of different landscapes, bright colors, speed lines like you’d find in a Japanese manga comic and tons of “Easter eggs” in the backgrounds. New updates even give the software “costumes” inspired by classic TV shows and movies like Back to the Future and Knight Rider.
When I asked Rivian’s Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud why his team went this route, one word came up again and again: “Optimism.”
“We felt it was an opportunity to have a little bit of fun and create a personality around the car,” Hammoud said in a recent interview. More than that, he said, the new software interfaces reflect a philosophy inside Rivian. “We want it all to look inviting,” Hammoud said. “Our vehicles have a friendly look and that’s part of our brand… that optimism around what we're trying to do through electrification and protecting the world for our kids.”
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
Rivian’s new interface language went live this summer on the heavily updated 2025 R1S and R1T models and via software updates to earlier cars. They give owners an animated representation of their vehicle that spins and transforms as they adjust things like ride height settings and the various driving modes.
On another car, switching to sport mode might mean a new set of gauges on the central display or shifting the menus to a red color scheme. But on an R1S or R1T, a cartoon depiction of the car zooms onto what looks like a race track as its glowing taillights fade into a red-and-white background. Instead of pop-ups to confirm you’re in “Snow Mode” or some off-road setting, Rivian offers a shift to a charming winter landscape or the vehicle perched atop a rocky mountain. Clouds, windmills and birds move about in the backgrounds and all of these visuals take on a different character at night as well.
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
None of this is vital for a car to function properly, of course, and it’s highly unlikely that these animated graphics will be a make-or-break selling point. But they add a ton of something intangible—character—to Rivian’s cars, and they turn something that used to be an afterthought at best into something you actually look forward to using. And Hammoud said that a ton of effort went into devising how this ecosystem should look and feel.
“We used this idea of manga-style [or] Studio Ghibli films, those really optimistic movies where you feel like you're in another world, and really taking that into a style where we could create the different worlds of the drive modes,” Hammoud said. He’s of course referring to the famed Japanese animated classics from Hayao Miyazaki and other creators like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and, most recently, The Boy and the Heron. All of those are landmark animated films released to international acclaim. But Hammoud said they also share the general vibe Rivian is going for these days.
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
“You look at something like Akira, versus Studio Ghibli,” he said, referring to the 1980s comic and landmark animated film about a dystopian future. The latter is “a little bit more optimistic and on the friendly side of that. We want to communicate power and dynamism with the vehicle, but we still wanted to have this sort of, ‘sitting down Sunday morning watching cartoons with your kids’ vibe with it as well.”
That stands in stark contrast with another eye-catching electric vehicle designed that has a distinctly apocalyptic energy: hard angles, allegedly bulletproof stainless steel, a “Bioweapon Defense Mode.” While Hammoud didn’t mention it by name, he made clear that he, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe and their design teams didn’t share the same philosophy.
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
“When you look at trucks, their faces are very aggressive, very angry, like the front ends could eat small children,” Hammoud said. “Purposely, we're like, ‘All right, well, we don't need a big grill.’ We want it to look inviting. Look at our headlight shapes. Our vehicles have a friendly look.”
Much of this was afforded by the power of the Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics software system made famous in video games that’s now making its way to the automotive world. This allowed Rivian’s artists and designers to “scale” all these new images easily without having to draw each one individually.
“It was really important to us that whatever car you have, it’s the right set of wheels and it's the right color [on the screen], so that way we're looking at is actually representative of your vehicle,” Hammoud said. “If we had to create, which is what we did in the past, an image for every single [Rivian color or option], that’s thousands and thousands of images.”
With the Unreal Engine, Hammoud said, “You put in the specifications of the vehicle, like if it's a Forest Green car with 22s, you just put that into the code, and boom, it's rendered and it updates.”
2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Graphics
Rivian isn’t alone in trying to add a more distinctive look and character to its software experience as well as its exterior designs. Mini recently added a cartoon dog to its infotainment systems as an AI-powered virtual assistant, and several Chinese automakers are taking similar approaches. And as with those cars, Rivian’s approach goes beyond mere visuals; these functions represent new ways for drivers to interact with their cars and control their features in the software-driven vehicle era.
So does it work? Based on a recent test of a 2025 Rivian R1S, I think the answer is mostly yes. It’s fairly easy to find the functions you want and the big, bright displays represent novel ways of presenting information to the driver. That’s crucial since Rivian famously—or perhaps infamously—eschews most physical buttons and Apple CarPlay in its EVs. It also aims to do more with voice controls, although it has a ways to go there to match many competitors.
But this approach to software does show what Rivian’s made of, and why a traditional conglomerate like the Volkswagen Group sees such value in what the company does. That 2025 R1S got better while I had it, receiving an over-the-air software update that improved the energy and efficiency gauges (and put them in line with the rest of the car’s new artistic language) while correcting some issues with the stereo and adding the Halloween-themed visuals.
And until Rivian can get the upcoming R2, R3 and R3X models on the road, it’s got more in store for its current cars both through software updates and more tweaks—though Hammoud was cagey about what exactly is coming next.
“We have some new updates that are coming next year on R1 that I'm excited to share, some special editions,” Hammoud said. “I'll leave it at that.”

The Porsche Macan Electric Is Being Recalled Because Its Headlights Are Too Bright,https://insideevs.com/news/742893/porsche-macan-electric-ev-recall-headlights/,"The fix doesn’t require new parts, thankfully. But you'll still need to schedule a service visit.",2024-12-02 08:19:26,"The electric Porsche Macan has been on sale in the United States for two months, and now there’s already a recall with its name on it. Thankfully, there’s no need for spare parts and it’s not the kind of recall that deals with flapping body panels.
However, despite this being a software-related problem, owners will still need to go to a Porsche service center to get it sorted out. That’s because the headlights are too bright and the headlight control unit software will need to be reprogrammed to comply with federal regulation. And that can't be done via an over-the-air update.
As per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the upper beams on certain Macan Electric models aren’t calibrated properly and may shine too bright, which could reduce visibility for incoming drivers and thus increase the risk of a crash. Due to a software data set error, the affected vehicles were programmed from the factory after the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) specs, whereas U.S.-spec vehicles need to conform to the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).
More Porsche Stuff
In total, 2,941 Porsche Macan Electric built between March 15, 2024, and November 4, 2024, are affected by the recall. Cars assembled after November 18 were shipped with the correct headlight software that complies with FMVSS No. 108.
The fix for the affected EVs is free of charge. Porsche will notify dealers on December 11, while owners will be notified on January 24, 2025.
The Porsche Macan Electric is sold alongside the gas-powered model in the United States. In Europe, however, the combustion-powered version has been retired due to new cybersecurity regulations and not because of tightening emissions regulations.
Stateside, the most affordable Macan Electric starts at $75,300, but in traditional Porsche fashion, one could double the price tag relatively easily by going down the (very) long options list.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Buy A Knockoff NACS To CCS Adapter,https://insideevs.com/news/742873/nacs-to-ccs-dc-to-dc-adapter-cheap-vs-expensive/,"It might look the same as a product from a more established company on the outside, but it’s a different story inside.",2024-12-02 06:14:04,"Almost every car manufacturer that sells electric vehicles in the United States will get access to Tesla’s expansive Supercharger network of DC fast chargers. New models will come out of the factory gates with Tesla’s NACS plug starting next year, but owners of existing EVs will have to use an adapter to top up at Superchargers across the United States and Canada.
As a result, there’s a growing number of companies out there that are selling NACS to CCS DC fast charging adapters. But as always, not all of them are created equal and the devil is in the details.
For starters, you should know that automakers’ stance on using third-party adapters is simple: don’t use one. Ford, Rivian, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and all the others claim they won’t repair a vehicle under warranty if something went wrong during a charging session where a non-approved adapter was used.
More Charging Stories
That said, you might not want to pay hundreds of dollars for an approved product and instead go for the cheaper, knockoff version. Save a couple of bucks and be done with it. They look roughly the same as the more established units out there, so why bother? Well, as you’ll see in the Auto Buyers Guide video below, you might want to hold off on that no-name purchase.
Safety is the name of the game here. Most well-regarded DC-to-DC charging adapters are rated at 1,000 volts and 500 amps, which comes out to 500 kilowatts. That’s a lot of power to go through a hand-held device, so some temperature monitoring is required.
Both the Tesla-supplied NACS to CCS adapter and the Lectron-made unit come with a pair of thermal sensors that cut off the flow of electricity if the temperature of the power pins exceeds 185 degrees (85 degrees Celsius). The sensors are placed right next to the pins and, when triggered, send a command to the communications pin to end the charging session. The same happens when pressing the unlatch button–there’s a contact inside that sends a signal to end the flow of electricity.
The DC pins are massive on these units. They’re also made out of copper and coated with silver to improve conductivity.
As for the cheap knockoff adapters, things are slightly different, in a bad way. The unit that was disassembled in the video had two temperature sensors, just like the Lectron adapter, but the wires were just dangling inside the housing. They were not firmly placed next to the DC pins, so if they were to get very hot, the sensors would not cut off the flow of electricity and the adapter housing could melt. Furthermore, the power pins themselves are slimmer than on the more expensive products and they’re plated with tin, not silver, so the conductivity is smaller.
An interesting discovery after tearing apart a couple of these adapters is that neither the charging provider nor the car manufacturer has any way of knowing what type of adapter is being used. There’s no communication between the adapter and the car or between the charging stall and the adapter–the thermal sensors and latch contacts are just cutoff switches.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares Quits Amid Strategy Dispute,https://insideevs.com/news/742850/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-resignation/,"UAW boss Shawn Fain, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the move is “a major step in the right direction.”",2024-12-02 03:14:35,"Carlos Tavares has suddenly resigned from his position as Chief Operating Officer at Stellantis, one of the largest car manufacturers in the world. The decision was announced yesterday evening and the board of directors has already accepted Tavares’ resignation.
Stellantis has created an Interim Executive Committee which will effectively do Tavares’ job until a new CEO is appointed “within the first half of 2025.” Board of Directors chairman John Elkman leads the IEC.
Previously, Tavares, who has acted as CEO since Stellantis’ creation in 2021, said he would stick to his role in the company until his mandate ended in early 2026. The comments came after Stellantis acknowledged it was looking for a successor to him.
More Stellantis Stories
Bloomberg wrote that Tavares’ sudden resignation came after a dispute with the board over how to turn the tides on weakening sales and a stock slump. In the third quarter, Stellantis reported a 27% drop in revenue and a 20% decline in shipments globally. In North America, the picture is even bleaker, with shipments down 36%.
Earlier this year, the automaker announced it would sell its massive Arizona proving grounds by the end of the year as a cost-cutting measure. Slow sales have also prompted Stellantis to pause the production of several models around the world, including the venerable Fiat Panda, electric Fiat 500e, Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee. The launch of the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and the range-extended Ram 1500 Ramcharger has also been delayed.
Maserati, the conglomerate’s highest-priced brand, is bleeding money, and Alfa Romeo, a staple of the Italian auto industry, is having a rough time appealing to American consumers–the Giulia sedan was the slowest-selling car in the U.S. in September, according to an analysis by CarEdge. Chrysler, meanwhile, is trying to survive with just one model in its lineup, the Pacifica minivan.
Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the decision is “a major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.”",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybercab: We Sit Inside Tesla's Driverless Car,https://insideevs.com/news/742776/tesla-cybercab-walkaround-interior-video/,"We climbed into the Tesla Cybercab, a two-seater with fully autonomous driving that could perhaps one day give life to the Model 2.",2024-12-01 12:00:00,"Editor's note: Our colleagues at Motor1 Italy had the chance to check out the Cybercab in person. They also had a rare opportunity to sit inside a Cybercab. The text that follows highlights their experience with the Tesla Cybercab.
Tesla has taken its Cybercab on a tour of Europe. Elon Musk's new self-driving vehicle has crossed the Atlantic Ocean, so we went to London to get a closer look at what it looks like. Not so much outside, since we had already gotten an idea of what it looked like during last month's unveiling, but inside.
We opened the doors, which lift upward with a butterfly opening and sat inside to get a sense of what it feels like to be in a car that, we'll say it now, has no steering wheel or pedals.
The Cybercab was designed from the outset for robotaxi service, and as you get on board, you get a clear sense of the priorities the designers have set for themselves. Not so much the fact that there is, as mentioned, no steering wheel or pedals, but the fact that the car is essential in every way.
The Tesla Cybercab seen in person
The dashboard, as on other Teslas on the road, is flat and horizontal. Everything revolves around the large central screen that will most likely be used to set the destination, look at the route, watch a movie, or listen to music while on the road. But touchscreen aside, the seats intrigue me the most.
More Cybercab Info
The Cybercab has only two seats. That's because it is expected to carry one or at most two people on most of the rides it will make. The seats are not wraparound. They are wide with flat backs. They look more like home chairs than ""automotive"" objects. The Cybercab will move exclusively in an urban environment and does not need contoured sides for body restraint during sideways acceleration.
There is only a central armrest between the two seats, and underneath are two cup holders. Stop: there is nothing else. This is intentional to keep costs down, but also for another reason. Tesla's idea is that these Cybercabs can use automatic sanitizing stations between rides. To ensure that all users can sit in a clean and sanitized cabin.
The seats look like two lounge chairs. Upholstered in leatherette, they are easily washable
If you want to see Tesla's robotaxi up close, here are the dates and locations where it will be on display. We'll say it now though, your viewing will be with the doors closed.",Eric Loveday
EVs Help Vehicle Emissions Drop To Historic Low In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/742785/evs-phevs-bring-emissions-down-record-lows/,"EVs and PHEVs brought huge climate wins for the transportation sector in 2023. Emissions are down, fuel economy levels are up.",2024-12-01 10:00:52,"Fully electric and hybrid vehicles are helping America reduce greenhouse gas emissions to record levels, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a newly published report this week. EVs are not only helping bring down harmful carbon dioxide emissions but are also increasing fleetwide fuel economy rates to record highs.
Transportation accounts for the highest share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Fifty-seven percent of the transportation sector’s emissions come from light-duty vehicles, as per the EPA. Tailpipe emissions have been labeled as public health hazards and are directly linked to respiratory illnesses and lung diseases.
Now a combination of pro-EV regulatory framework, compliance by automakers and increasing adoption from consumers is helping turn the tide. The real-world new-vehicle CO2 emissions dropped to a record low of 319 grams per mile for MY2023 vehicles, an 18-point reduction compared to the previous model year vehicles.
Fleetwide fuel-economy levels for new vehicles reached a record 27.1 miles per gallon, a 1.1 mpg increase compared to the year before. The EPA said increased production of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models significantly influenced these trends. Automakers sold a record 1.1 million EVs and PHEVs in 2023. That number is expected to grow when 2024 sales numbers are out early next year.
Without EVs and hybrids, emissions would have risen to 357 grams per mile and fuel efficiency would have stagnated at 24.9 mpg.
So, who are the good and the bad actors? Tesla has been the manufacturer with the highest fuel economy since 2016 when it began mass production of the Model 3 sedan. That’s unsurprising because Tesla only makes fully electric models. However, according to EPA data, Stellantis has manufactured the dirtiest cars since 2015. Both automakers will remain in the same spots in 2024, as per a preliminary estimate.
Every major automaker witnessed a drop in their real-world CO2 emissions among new vehicles sold, except Honda and Toyota. The most significant year-over-year emissions drops came from Mercedes-Benz (-68 g/mi), BMW (-39 g/mi), Kia (-17 g/mile) and Nissan (-17 g/mile). And the largest fuel economy improvements were also from these brands.
The EPA added that SUVs are now cleaner than sedans, as they’re increasingly electrified and automakers sell more of them. The category now accounts for the lowest average new-vehicle CO2 emissions as electric SUVs accounted for 36% of all MY2023 SUVs sold. Their fuel economy also has been increasing the most over the years.
“This report provides a critical data-driven affirmation that strong, technology-neutral standards can underpin environmental progress while saving drivers money at the pump,” EPA Administrator Michael S Regan said in a statement. “Manufacturers continue to innovate and are bringing technologies to market which will directly improve air quality, better protecting people’s health and saving lives.”

"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,2024-12-25 01:26:07,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

Here Are All The EVs And Hybrids That Qualify For A Tax Credit In 2024 (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/702784/ev-tax-credit-2024-official/,"The tax credit for EVs provides up to $7,500 toward a purchase of a qualifying Tesla, Rivian or other plug-in car.",2024-12-01 07:20:38,"A year ago, nearly every new electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid on the market qualified for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, provided it was manufactured in North America. But the rules changed in a major way in 2024. The new year brings big restrictions on which EVs and hybrids get the tax break as the U.S. looks to crack down on battery components sourced from China.
In other words, if you were banking on a tax credit to help get you into a new electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid for 2024, your list of choices is now smaller and less straightforward than before. Still, $7,500 is serious money. It could make the difference between buying and not buying an electric car—so it's key to which vehicles are eligible for the tax credit for EVs in 2024.
Plus, as automakers launch new models and change up their supply chains to comply with the new rules over time, we should see many more cars qualify. The list has already grown this year, with popular cars like the Tesla Model 3 Long Range regaining eligibility after a short hiatus. So we'll be sure to keep this list updated with the latest news.
Here's the full list of eligible EVs from FuelEconomy.gov, where you can also check if a certain car qualifies from its VIN:
And here's the list of qualifying plug-in hybrids:
Definitely not a huge list. And one that's missing some heavy hitters like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-E. So what gives here, exactly? That requires a bit of a history lesson.
The longstanding EV tax credit was revised and modernized as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022. That legislation had a number of goals—including possibly conflicting ones—like encouraging local manufacturing and lessening China's iron grip on the battery supply chain. (The tax credits also have limits based on a buyer's annual income and the price of the vehicle in question to keep these from just being luxury gifts to wealthy drivers.)
The new credits went into effect in January of last year. But over the subsequent months, the list of qualifying vehicles became narrower and narrower, prioritizing batteries and battery components made in North America as well. Now, the rules stipulate that starting in 2024 any vehicle containing battery components from what the government calls a ""foreign entity of concern"" will be excluded from receiving tax credits. The so-called ""FEOC"" rules pretty much directly target China, and given that country's utter dominance of the battery supply chain, a lot of new cars get left out.
On the plus side, it's crucial to note that leasing will still get you the full tax credit regardless of where the car was made, a loophole that has greatly benefitted foreign manufacturers like Kia and Hyundai. Additionally, the credits now apply at the point of sale, meaning you get an instant price cut on these cars without having to wait for tax season.
Those point-of-sale rebates have proved mighty popular. So far this year, EV buyers have received over $1 billion in incentives for some 150,000 car purchases, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

"Tesla, Two Other Brands' EV Sales Are Most Driven By Tax Credits",https://insideevs.com/news/742782/tesla-ev-tax-credit-jdpower-study/,"The modern EV tax credit system may be on the way out when President Trump returns, but it has some surprising winners and losers.",2024-11-30 16:25:31,"President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal the electric vehicle tax credits ushered in by the Inflation Reduction Act, but that move is surprisingly supported by his new buddy-advisor-campaign financier Elon Musk. But a new study from J.D. Power indicates that Tesla's sales really do stand to take a hit if those credits go away.
The auto industry marketing research firm's latest E-Vision Intelligence Report has some fascinating new data about which automakers benefitted most from the tax credits, which cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new EV purchase or lease if certain conditions are met. The biggest winners: Volkswagen, Chevrolet, and Tesla, in that order.
""Among all EV purchase drivers, tax credits and incentive programs are the most frequently selected reason for purchase among Volkswagen (81%), Chevrolet (77%) and Tesla (72%) buyers,"" the study said. The report was based on a survey of new car buyers but interestingly does not include Tesla Cybertruck, Polestar, and Rivian owners.
To qualify for EV tax credits, generally speaking, the EVs and their batteries must be made in North America, as the IRA is meant to incentivize local production.
According to the survey, the ""premium vehicle segment""—of which all Tesla models are included—benefitted the most from the tax credits. While that does play into the criticism that tax dollars are essentially helping wealthier people buy expensive cars, it also makes sense; EVs for now are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts and cheaper, more mainstream models are just now starting to debut after years of being confined to the higher end of things. In the ""premium"" arena, ""64% of EV owners say tax credits and other incentives influenced their purchase decision. In the mass market segment, 49% of EV owners were influenced by tax credits and incentives."" And it seems like the inclusion of Tesla as a ""premium"" brand helped skew the data in that direction as well.
After all, a Volkswagen ID.4 can be obtained at fairly mainstream prices now, and all of Chevrolet's EVs represent great values that aren't too far off their gas-powered counterparts depending on equipment and trim levels. Thus, it could be argued that the tax credits are succeeding in moving the EV sector into more normal levels of pricing; as EV sales increase and the battery supply chain grows, prices will continue to go down.
The numbers are fascinating: ""Among premium brand EV owners, 64% say that tax credits and other incentives were a primary driver of their decision to purchase or lease their EV,"" the study said. ""Among mass-market EV owners, 49% selected their vehicle based on tax credits and incentives. Industry-wide, 87% of all EVs purchased or leased in 2024 received the federal EV tax credit.""
Moreover, the tax credits are helping people to save money at a time when new car prices are through the roof and everyone's getting squeezed out on grocery prices. ""On average, consumers purchasing or leasing a new EV in 2024 saved $5,124 thanks to federal EV tax incentives,"" the study said. ""That’s up from $4,302 in 2023 and $1,629 in 2022. For EV leases in 2024, the average amount claimed in federal tax incentives was $6,696, and for sales, it was $4,257.""
So whose buyers were least motivated by the EV tax credits? According to J.D. Power, that would be Toyota, Hyundai and Kia—a truly interesting result. None of those Asian automakers build their EVs in America (though this is changing right now with the new Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and others) and so they do not qualify for the tax credits unless they're leased. Somewhere between a fifth and a third of those brands' buyers said they were motivated by the tax credits. In Hyundai and Kia's case, EVs also benefitted from aggressive manufacturer and dealer discounts. That all tracks with what we already know: most Hyundai and Kia EVs are leased, and it may speak to why the Korean automakers' executives say they aren't worried about sales dropping if they lose the credits.
The study also confirms one thing we've been hearing for the past few years: that the EV tax credit scheme is confounding to many buyers and they probably aren't getting much help navigating it from their dealers. ""All told, 43% of EV shoppers say they would describe their understanding of current EV incentives as 'vague,' 'minimal' or 'don’t know,'"" the study said. ""Just 17% say they have a 'strong' understanding of EV incentives.""
There are a few things we can glean from all of this data. First, it's yet another data point that counters Musk's claim that losing the tax credits ""probably actually helps Tesla"" in the long term, unless he's counting on a total collapse of the sector without the IRA. Second, losing the tax credits will probably hit reset on the calculus the entire auto industry has been working on for the past few years. And finally, it's further proof that the tax credits are helping to move metal and save people money at the same time.  “Having that extra incentive was enough to convince people to buy their EV,” Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice, told Automotive News. “It wasn’t just the price alone.”

This Hellcat Is A Tesla Model S Plaid Underneath: 'It Fits Perfect',https://insideevs.com/news/742777/tesla-hellcat-boosted-boiz/,"The BoostedBoiz are at it again with another Tesla body swap, and you don't want to rev on this at a stoplight.",2024-11-30 12:00:00,"We're now a few weeks away from the first Dodge Charger EVs hitting the streets, and even if the Mopar-or-no-car crowd is understandably skeptical about trading Hemi V8 power for electricity, we know that car won't be messing around at the drag strip. But as they tend to do, the tuners got there first.
The guys at the BoostedBoiz channel are at it again with another build and this is perhaps their most subversive one yet: a 2023 Dodge Challenger Hellcat gutted and swapped with a Tesla Model S Plaid drivetrain and battery. You've likely seen these guys and their wild creations in the electric space before: they're the nutjobs who turned a ratty old Honda Odyssey minivan into a drag-strip killer using another Plaid drivetrain. That 1,020-horsepower sleeper van proved able to handle itself against a modified Porsche 911 Turbo S at an oval track earlier this year, so it's fair to say these guys know what they're doing.
Yet host Kyle Wade said that he got this even brighter idea when he realized that the Model S has a nearly identical wheelbase to a Challenger. The remarkably similar size, he figured, would allow them to package the Model S' battery, motors and other internals more easily than other swaps. Plus, it'd be fun to screw with those owners: ""I couldn't think of a better group of people to not want one of their cars to be taken and turned into an EV,"" he said.
I say it's all in good fun; what's the modified drag racing scene without crazy ideas and one-upmanship?
Tesla Challenger BoostedBoiz
After finding a 2013 Challenger shell at a junkyard on Facebook Marketplace for $700 (honestly, not bad) the crew took it back to their shop and immediately started cutting the floor out. Despite the cars' similar size, swapping the Tesla onto the Dodge wasn't as straightforward as expected; they had to cut off and rework nearly the entire front section of the Challenger plus a significant part of the rear to accommodate the Tesla's suspension. And that was only the start of the extensive bodywork needed to make this happen, which they recap in the video above.
This whole project really took some doing, but in the end, it worked as expected. The front part of the interior is all Tesla, complete with a custom metal seat, and when the body was fully reassmbled by the end it's hard to distinguish the Challenger from any other out there—unless you take a look inside or under the hood.
Also, the radio and climate controls still work. Amazing.
The only thing that would give this ""Cybercat"" away is how it would blast off a stoplight while making no noise whatsoever. With all-wheel-drive and 1,020 horsepower, it's just gone with zero drama.
You know this crew is going to do more with this build at the track soon, and I'm excited to see what they do with it. And I'm even more excited to see the reactions to it. ""The SRT boys are gonna be real mad about this one,"" Kyle said.

"MKBHD Has A Crush On The Polestar 3, But He Wouldn’t Buy One",https://insideevs.com/news/742749/mkbhd-polestar-3-crush-review/,The content creator says there is a big difference between the Polestar 3’s highs and lows.,2024-11-30 10:00:32,"Polestar offers the Polestar 3 as a sportier alternative to the Volvo EX90, with which it shares its underpinnings, motors, batteries and tech. The result is a crossover that is easy to recommend even despite its quirks, and it made Marques Brownlee fall in love with it. He also said it’s not a car he would consider buying for himself.
The tech vlogger explains in the video review he uploaded on his car-centric channel Auto Focus that there is a significant difference between the car’s high and low points. It does several things really well, one of which is design. Its exterior is unique with its lower-slung take on the SUV formula and a tapering roofline that doesn’t quite put it in the coupe-SUV genre.
Polestar has even integrated a wing in the front—very unusual—which helps smooth the air flowing over the car and is complemented by an additional wing in the back. There are additional “aero blades” on the rear of the car, which serve the same purpose on the sides of the car.
Second-row headroom isn’t affected by the shape of the roof, and the interior is also a pleasant place to be. It strikes a great balance between the ultra-minimalist approach you see in a Tesla and the more conventional button-heavy cars, although it still leans too much toward minimalism, according to Marques.
He points to the confusing unlabeled buttons on the steering wheel or the single pair of window controls for the front and back glass. The Polestar 3 is also one of those cars whose glove box only opens through the screen—ugh.

There is little to criticize about the SPA2 platform that underpins the Polestar 2. It is the first production vehicle to have this platform, which bestows it with a 111-kilowatt-hour battery pack good for up to 350 miles of EPA range. The top dual-motor version makes 510 horsepower and accelerates to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, but its claimed range drops to 279 miles.
It can decouple its motors to maximize coasting efficiency, and the dual-motor variant gets torque vectoring, which Polestar says improves cornering speed and improves traction on slippery surfaces.
Another thing that makes the Polestar 3 attractive is its eligibility for the full $7,500 federal tax credit. It lowers the South Carolina-built SUV’s entry price to $67,500, helping it undercut rivals like the BMW iX or the Audi Q8 E-Tron.

Jaguar Will Buy Back Thousands Of I-Pace EVs That Could Catch Fire,https://insideevs.com/news/742670/jaguar-buying-back-ipace-fire/,"All these Jaguar EVs were subject to recalls meant to address the fire risk, but it apparently wasn’t fixed.",2024-11-29 10:00:34,"Jaguar can’t seem to catch a break these days. After its rebranding campaign attracted a lot of negativity, now it’s decided to buy back nearly 3,000 of its I-Pace EVs due to the risk of fire. Owners of these vehicles had previously been asked to charge their vehicles outside, and dealers installed an 80% charging limit to minimize the risk of a battery malfunction that could set the battery pack and the entire vehicle alight.
All of the 2,760 affected examples were built in 2018 and were all subject to recalls meant to address the fire risk. They received software fixes for this issue, but they apparently didn’t work, and three cars still caught fire even after they were updated. When Jaguar informed the owners of the affected vehicles that they should park and charge outside (in August), the manufacturer said it was working on a permanent solution.
The automaker investigated the issue further and probably discovered that repairing all the affected cars (like GM did with the Chevy Bolt EV) wasn’t economically viable or too complicated. This could explain why Jaguar resorted to buying all of the cars, and it remains to be seen what sort of compensation it has planned for the owners. The I-Pace is a heavily depreciating car, and the affected examples are over five years old by now, so it won’t be as big a financial burden as buying back cars that are still new.
In June of 2023, Jaguar recalled almost 6,400 I-Pace EVs manufactured between 2018 and 2023 to have their battery control module software updated and any battery modules with faulty cells (manufactured by LG Energy Solutions) replaced. The recall came after eight I-Pace fires in the U.S. alone.
More On The I-Pace
Jaguar has announced that I-Pace production will end in December of this year, when its total global sales are expected to reach around 70,000 units. The I-Pace is made by Magna Steyr in Austria, which also manufactures the smaller E-Pace crossover. Jaguar also stopped production of the XE, XF and F-Type in May to prepare for its repositioning as a more premium Porsche and Bentley rival.
It will launch three new electric models built on a bespoke EV platform. The first will be a fancy fastback previewed by a concept car set to be revealed on December 2 in Miami. Jaguar has teased the upcoming study, which, just like its rebranding as a whole.",Andrei Nedelea
"Fiat 500e Production Paused, Again",https://www.motor1.com/news/742532/fiat-500-electric-production-paused/,Two Maserati models will also be out of commission for a whole month.,2024-12-25 01:26:10,"Oh, here we go again. Stellantis has no other option but to pause production of the Fiat 500e. Demand for the electric city car continues to be poor, forcing another hiatus at the Mirafiori plant. The Italian factory suspended output several times this year and it's about to do it once more. After telling unions that operations would be suspended from December 18 until January 5, it’s now adding the December 2-17 interval to the stoppage.
Consequently, the Fiat 500e will not be assembled from Monday, December 2, until Sunday, January 5, 2025. It’s not just the diminutive hatchback impacted by the low demand as Maserati is facing an identical problem. Production of the GranTurismo and GrabCabrio will also be halted during this interval. Through the voice of Stellantis’ head honcho Carlos Tavares, the exotic brand recently blamed bad marketing for sluggish sales.
Fiat’s parent company says activities at its factory in Turin will be temporarily stopped due to a ""continuing uncertainty in sales of electric cars in several European markets.” EVs account for 97% of the production at the Mirafiori facility. Stellantis goes on to say it’s putting the brakes on Maserati production as well due to low demand for luxury cars outside Europe, such as the United States and China.
The wheels are in motion to resuscitate sales of the new Fiat 500 by selling a version with a combustion engine. The plan is to roll out a hybrid 500 in 2026 when production will commence at the same Italian site. Made in Poland, the previous-generation model is still sold in certain regions with gas power. Yes, we’re talking about a car that originally hit the market in 2007. Its Abarth hot hatch counterpart is still available, but Fiat’s performance division has already announced plans to go purely electric.

The Electric Range Rover Might Have Four Motors,https://insideevs.com/news/742673/range-rover-electric-hot-weather-testing/,“The most capable and refined” Range Rover will go on sale next year.,2024-11-29 06:06:43,"Well, it’s happening. The Range Rover, a vehicle that’s widely recognized as one of the poshest, most comfortable and off-road capable SUVs in the world, is getting an all-electric version. But you’d be forgiven for believing that the Range Rover Electric–that’s the official name–is powered by anything but dinosaur juice.
That’s because the battery-powered Range Rover looks exactly like its gas-powered counterpart. At least, that’s what I’m getting from the latest batch of official photos released by Land Rover. The electric Range Rover prototypes are currently undergoing hot weather testing in the United Arab Emirates, and the British marque seems to think there’s no point in keeping the luxury EV under wraps anymore–because it’s exactly like the ICE SUV we already know.
Take a look for yourself. All the official images are in the gallery below, and apart from a couple of add-on monitoring devices that are to be expected on development prototypes, the Range Rover Electric is the same elegant SUV that’s become a staple of understated luxury–and massive depreciation rates, but that’s another story.
More Electric SUVs
We still don’t know what’s under the skin of the big electric SUV, but Land Rover mentioned the Range Rover EV will get something called Intelligent Torque Management. According to the automaker, the system distributes the wheel slip management task to each individual electric drive control unit, reducing the torque reaction time at each wheel from around 100 milliseconds to as little as 1 millisecond.
That’s mighty impressive. It also sounds a lot like the Range Rover Electric will have four motors, possibly one for each wheel, something we’ve only seen on a handful of production vehicles so far, including the Rivian R1S Quad-Motor, Rimac Nevera and Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology. (Try saying that three times in a row.)
This is still unconfirmed, so take it with a grain of salt. The size of the battery and the power of the electric motors are still unknown. That said, I wouldn’t expect record-breaking driving range figures, seeing how the gas-powered Range Rover is already quite heavy, tipping the scales at around 5,000 pounds. Adding a big battery will only make the thing harder to move, which will surely take a toll on the range.
But in the luxury world, it seems that going very far on a full charge isn’t quite as important as the experience itself. Just look at the Rolls-Royce Spectre–it weighs a healthy 6,600 pounds and can go up to 277 miles on a full charge. That hasn’t stopped Rolls-Royce from posting record sales, though.",Iulian Dnistran
You Can Finally Buy Your Tesla When The Lease Ends–Except In These States,https://insideevs.com/news/742650/tesla-lease-buyout-2024/,All of Tesla’s passenger EVs are eligible for the new lease buyout option.,2024-11-29 03:23:17,"Tesla is once again offering its customers the option to purchase their electric cars when the lease term ends. The AI and robotics company previously allowed lease buyouts for the Model S and Model X but that option was retired in 2022.
Now, it’s back. Starting November 27, 2024, all of Tesla’s passenger EVs are eligible for the lease buyout. This means the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck can be bought outright from Tesla at the end of the lease instead of just returning them to the automaker. Third-party dealerships are also eligible to purchase leased EVs.
However, according to Tesla's updated Lease-End Options webpage, customers in Iowa and Louisiana are not eligible for lease buyouts.
More Tesla Stuff
If the car is leased through Tesla Lease Trust and you want to buy it and keep it at the end of the lease, the automaker will provide a purchase estimate through the Tesla smartphone app. Owners need to access the “Financing” tab, then go to “Lease Details,” “Manage Lease” and select “Purchase Vehicle.” After confirming the intent to buy the car, Tesla will prepare a purchase packet with a good through date that matches the estimate, as per the automaker’s website.
A vehicle inspection will be made if it’s needed, according to the local requirements. Also, all the the parties listed on the lease agreement need to sign the purchase packet and then the estimated purchase amount has to be paid in full. Finally, Tesla will review and prepare the necessary paperwork and the ownership transfer documents will be mailed to the owner.
This is good news for anyone who was hoping to keep their leased Tesla but we can’t but question the reason behind the decision. In the past, the automaker’s outspoken CEO, Elon Musk, said that Tesla’s intention for the returning leased vehicles is to transform them into self-driving vehicles eventually. Does the reintroduction of the lease buyout option mean that robotaxi dreamers are left waiting for the Cybercab? Or maybe it’s just another end-of-year push to get some more money?
We don’t know–Tesla doesn’t answer questions from the media. One thing is clear, though: if you want to buy your leased Tesla, now is the time.",Iulian Dnistran
"Rivian Will Power Volkswagen’s Electric Golf, ‘Project Trinity’",https://insideevs.com/news/742492/vw-project-trinity-rivian-sdv/,"The tech will first come to Audi and Porsche as early as 2027, but VW's flagship EV is on that list too.",2024-11-28 14:00:05,"Volkswagen's flagship EV, coined ""Project Trinity,"" has been hyped up as the German brand's saving grace in a time when VW has gone from just a cool guy brand to one that is struggling to convince people to buy their vehicles. But, VW has also been kicking Trinity's can down the road, delaying it in favor of other vehicles like the new Golf EV and members of the current ID-family lineup. Now we know why.
It turns out that Volkswagen is really taking to its new partnership with Rivian—after all, it's spending $5 billion on the joint venture for a reason. And Trinity? Well, its flagship EV should be using its new flagship architecture. And that's exactly what the automaker plans on doing, according to Automotive News.
It turns out that Project Trinity is alive, although delayed, and is still planned to have all those nifty features like Level 4 self-driving. Part of the reason for that delay isn't just to first move forward with a more ""iconic product,"" as VW justifyingly calls the electrified version of the Golf, but to also give the automaker some time to figure out how to best implement the new Software-Defined Vehicle architecture borrowed from its joint partnership with Rivian.
“We decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,” VW's CEO, Thomas Schafer, during a media roundtable. “It will happen with Rivian, the joint venture, where we put the new electric electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we’ll start with the Golf.”
The Golf will be shown in 2029, followed by Trinity at a later date. While this doesn't explicitly give a timeline to Trinity's launch, it does confirm earlier reports from the German newspaper Handelsblatt that Trinity would be pushed back in favor of the Golf EV and that its launch would not be in 2026 as originally intended. Current rumors point to a reveal in 2032 at the earliest.
That being said, don't expect to see a million VW Trinities (or whatever Volkswagen ends up calling it) on the road. The car is planned to be a bespoke product—think the venerable Phaeton, but electric instead of the niche W12 under the hood. I'm not sure that's the best move for Volkswagen right now, but maybe things will turn around in the next eight years.
“We just switched a little bit, moved it out a little bit, not because we don’t see it as a huge priority, but Trinity was never designed as a volume vehicle,” said Schafer.
The Golf won't be the first EV in Volkswagen's family of brands to get Rivian treatment. Schafer confirmed that Porsche and Audi will be the first brands to receive the new electrical architecture as early as 2027. This tracks with the idea of more expensive and experimental tech being stuffed in high-end brands before trickling down to the mass market. But fear not—the architecture will eventually underpin vehicles across the VW family of brands, from cheap compacts to luxury SUVs (and maybe even sport-focused cars as well).
As for Project Trinity, well, that still appears to be Volkswagen's Polaris more than anything else, just a bit delayed now. If impressive enough, maybe Trinity can spark some interest back in the VW brand for the mass market, even if the car isn't intended to be built in large numbers. The important thing is that Volkswagen is using the tech to build a thicker backbone, and Trinity could be one of the most important building blocks along the way.

Tesla Finally Grants Owners Control Of The Charging Port Heater,https://insideevs.com/news/742609/tesla-charging-port-heater-control/,"You once could enable the port warmer in combination with other heating elements, but now it can be done separately.",2024-11-28 13:26:49,"Teslas started getting charging port heaters in the second part of 2020, although not all vehicles produced that year have it. Now all models get this dedicated heater that specifically warms the charging port to prevent ice buildup, allowing owners to easily open it in winter, but how you enable it isn’t obvious.
This is because until now you haven’t been able to turn the charger on separately. You could enable it together with the rear defrost (which also heats the side mirrors) or along with heating the cabin, but not on its own. Now, according to Not A Tesla App, the manufacturer has rolled out an over-the-air update that finally allows owners to only enable the port heater without it being paired with something else.
This was added with software version 2024.44.3.1, and the feature was confirmed on the Model Y and Model X, but it’s surely going to come to the rest of the model lineup. With this update installed, you will find an option called Charge Port Heater if you go to Controls then Service.
More On EVs In Winter
Owners who live in colder climates will benefit most since they will be able to keep the charge port ice-free without expending additional energy to defrost the windows or heat up the cabin. It still comes on automatically with the general defrost functions, as well as when you precondition the battery for charging or select a Supercharger as the destination via the car’s navigation.
It’s not all that common to get a charging port door that’s frozen in place and won’t open, though. Even with heavy snowfall, unless the snow melts and is then frozen, you should still be able to plug in.
A bigger issue that Tesla owners have had in winter is frozen doors and windows. Since all Tesla vehicles have frameless doors, the side windows need to roll down automatically about an inch to open the door. If there’s ice buildup that doesn’t allow the window to go down, you won’t be able to open the door.
Frozen door handles are also a source of annoyance, especially for owners of the Model S and Model X, whose door handles are powered and are meant to extend when the vehicle is unlocked. However, when the car is locked they sit flush with the body, thick ice can form on top of them and the power of their servos won’t be enough to punch through.
Model Y and Model 3 door handles aren’t powered so owners need to push on the back of the handle to make the front part pop out to open any of the doors. However, these too can get blocked, so Tesla redesigned them to be pushed from both sides to help make breaking ice easier. We know frozen charging ports and door handles are among the most common EV winter issues. Let us know in the comments if it’s ever happened to you and how you dealt with it.",Andrei Nedelea
Volkswagen Is Planning A Major Design Overhaul With More Buttons,https://www.motor1.com/news/742405/vw-design-overhaul-more-buttons/,"It also wants to improve interior quality, leading with the next ID.3 and ID.4.",2024-12-25 01:26:13,"Facing plant closures and massive layoffs, it’s safe to say Volkswagen has lost its mojo. The years when the Golf used to dominate sales charts in Europe seem like distant memories. The so-so styling of its electric cars isn’t exactly driving people into showrooms, and the oversimplified interiors aren't helping either. All while prices increase, forcing customers to reconsider their options.
But a fix is on the way, or so VW pledges. In an interview with Auto Express, VW’s development boss Kai Grünitz promised significant changes are planned. The next ID.3 and ID.4 will usher in a ""completely new design language."" That’s great to hear since the bulbous EVs could really need a fresh look. He went on to say a revamped visual identity will mark a return to form by going “back to where we originally came from, from a design perspective, and return to what Volkswagen is known for.”
Stepping inside, the user interface will also be improved by bringing back more traditional controls. Expect future VWs to feature extra buttons to quickly access often-used functions instead of having to rely on submenus on the touchscreen. Aside from adding back conventional keys as previewed by the ID.2all concept, a boost in quality is on the way. That’s one of the major problems the Golf Mk8 is facing, especially when compared to its excellent predecessor.
But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard promises about nicer interiors. At the end of 2022, VW Group chairman Oliver Blume talked about a “quality offensive.” As you can imagine, these changes don’t happen overnight. We’ll have to wait for the next generation of cars to see whether the folks from Wolfsburg live up to their promises.
Talking specifically about the ID.3 and ID.4, Kai said VW will also bring “a lot of improvements in terms of battery costs and performance.” He went as far as to say the overhauled EVs “will be a huge improvement” for both the automaker (by driving down production costs) and its customers by getting better cars overall. The new electric vehicles are expected to arrive in 2026.
It’s too soon to say whether the ID.3 will keep its name. VW has already announced the ninth-generation Golf is going to be electric, with the Mk8 to continue with combustion engines until as late as 2035. At the beginning of the year, Kai strongly hinted the return of the electric Golf could kill the ID.3: “There is not enough space to have two or three different models fitting to the same customer. We've started to work on a fully electric Golf.”

"Honda’s CUV e: EV Scooter Lands In Europe, Could Change The E-Mobility Game",https://www.rideapart.com/news/742089/honda-cuv-e-electric-scooter-launch-europe/,Honda’s practical EV scooter leverages the Mobile Power Pack e:,2024-12-25 01:26:13,"A lot of the new electric two-wheeler innovations we’ve been seeing in recent years have come mostly from new players which were mostly previously unheard of. And unfortunately, a lot of these companies have been forced to shut down due to a myriad of financial issues.
But one thing a lot of these companies had in common was that they were perhaps simply dreaming too big. Companies like Sondors and Fuell revealed highly sophisticated and futuristic two-wheelers which were just trying to be too many things all at once. Plus, the fact that these brands pretty much had zero track record in the motorcycle industry didn’t really help, either.
But now we’re seeing mainstream players join the electric scene in full force. We’ve seen it with Kawasaki’s Z and Ninja E-1, and now, with Honda, and its CUV e:, a simple, no-frills electric scooter.
Honda’s been making headlines recently when it comes to its electric initiatives. At EICMA, Big Red unveiled two EV motorcycle concepts, and not long after, announced that it was investing heavily in solid-state battery technology. All while Honda’s Mobile Power Pack e: has been proving its versatility in Europe and Japan, powering everything from construction equipment to light EVs to electric tourist boats.
And now, Honda has brought the CUV e: to Europe, and I think it’s an electric scooter that could change the game.
Why? Well, because it’s simple. You see, the CUV e: isn’t really trying to be anything other than a practical, utilitarian scooter that wants to get you from point A to B. It’s everything everyone has come to know and love about scooters, and it just so happens to be electric.
It gets a flat floorboard for you to put some stuff on, a comfortable seating position, a cubby hole up front, and the option to install a selection of practical accessories like a top case, luggage rack, and windscreen. Sure, it boasts connectivity tech like Honda’s RoadSync and built-in navigation. But it doesn’t go overboard with tons of tech simply for the sake of tech. Best of all, it’s powered by a tried and tested powertrain that puts the Honda Mobile Power Pack e: in the spotlight once again.
The CUV e: makes use of the portable Honda Mobile Power Pack e:.
With all the crazy things going on in the electric motorcycle industry, the Honda CUV e: certainly looks like a breath of fresh air. The fact that it’s made by one of the biggest and most trusted manufacturers in the world is a big plus, too. Now, I don’t know about you, but if I were asked whether I’d choose a Honda EV scooter or some Chinese knockoff EV scooter, you can bet I’d pick the Honda. Even if it cost twice that of the Chinese scooter.
To that end, how Honda prices this thing will indeed be a very important factor when considering its potential success. Nevertheless, Honda has proven that it knows how to make value-packed two-wheelers, and chances are the CUV e:’s price will reflect this, too.

Software glitches left an InsideEVs reporter stranded in rural Virginia. Production challenges piled up and customers faced maintenance issues. Fast forward 12 months and GM has staged a major turnaround. Its EVs are thriving and the Chevy Equinox EV is especially crushing it.
In an independent range test conducted by car trading and research firm Edmunds, the 2025 Chevy Equinox EV blew past its EPA range estimate of 319 miles. The base Equinox EV LT traveled 356 miles in the range test, a 12% improvement over its EPA rating. That's a pretty significant achievement, given that the Equinox EV LT is the cheapest EV with over 300 miles of range. Now we know that it can go far beyond that.
Edmunds also maintains a leaderboard for the longest-range EVs on sale in the U.S. The Equinox EV handily beat several other popular long-range EVs on that list, notably the 2023 Tesla Model Y, a direct competitor to the Chevy. The Model Y Long Range went 310 miles under similar conditions and the exact same test parameters. That's 46 miles of difference for a car that costs roughly $10,000 less by today's prices.
Speaking of prices, the Equinox EV is also the most affordable GM EV on the Ultium platform. It has a starting price of $35,000, including destination, which can come down to about $27,500 with the full $7,500 federal tax credit factored in. It's powered by an 85-kilowatt-hour battery back, sourced from Ultium Cells, a joint venture between GM and Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution.
The Equinox EV's observed energy consumption was also about 6% less than the EPA estimate. It consumed about 29 kilowatt hours per 100 miles, compared to 31 kWh per 100 miles as per the EPA, which translates to about 3.45 miles per kWh. That means it also fared better than the 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (338 miles), Honda Prologue (320 miles) and the Cadillac Lyriq (319 miles) respectively—the Prologue and Lyriq ride on the same Ultium platform.
The weather seems to have favored the range test, but the parameters are the exact same for all EVs. It was 61 degrees Fahrenheit and the test was conducted on a mix of city (60%) and highway (40%) driving. In InsideEVs 70 mph highway range test of the 2024 Equinox EV 2RS, the crossover managed to cover 306 miles, outperforming its EPA estimate of 291 miles.
The Chevy tackles two of the biggest concerns facing electric cars: range and affordability. That could be why it's the best-selling GM EV and among the best-selling non-Tesla EVs. In the third quarter, GM managed to sell nearly 10,000 units of this car. But now, some of that momentum could be stalled as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to slap a blanket 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, where the Equinox and Blazer EVs are manufactured.

The Best And Worst Times To Charge Your EV This Thanksgiving,https://insideevs.com/news/742511/ev-charging-trip-thanksgiving-tips/,And other tips for road tripping in your EV during one of the busiest holiday weekends.,2024-11-27 14:00:06,"For many EV owners, Thanksgiving will be one of only a handful of times a year that they need to visit a fast-charging station. That’s the beauty of EVs: For everyday use, owners can plug in at home and wake up to a full charge daily.
The flip side is that during the busiest holiday weekends, when everybody is out road tripping to see their families, EV drivers swarm a limited number of charging stations. That can result in long lines and a bad day. Nobody wants that.
A GM Energy charging station.
Paren, a firm specializing in EV charging data, projects 1.8 million public EV charging sessions during Thanksgiving week and says that drivers will spend a collective 8.5 million hours plugged in at the fast charging stations most likely to be used while traveling (those with four or more plugs).
We spoke to the folks there to get some tips on the best times to charge, what station locations to avoid and how to make your EV road trip the smoothest it can be.
Historically, public EV charging infrastructure has been problematic, to say the least. Plugs are broken or unavailable more often than owners would like. And there are still parts of the country where they’re hard to come by. Paren says that’s all improving.
According to the firm, 1,100 new public charging stations with four ports or more have come online since last Thanksgiving. Plus, charging networks like Electrify America are upgrading their old sites and paying more attention to reliability. Across the thousands of travel-oriented stations it analyzed, reliability is up slightly to 85.5%. Broadly speaking, that means 85 out of 100 visits will be successful, Paren CTO and cofounder Bill Ferro told InsideEVs. That’s better than before, but still “sketchy,” Ferro said.
At Tesla Superchargers, which aren’t factored into that data, reliability is likely higher, he said. But when you consider all fast-charging locations—not just the travel-focused stations—it’s a lot lower.
Paren says that despite the hundreds of thousands of new EVs that have hit the road in the last year, America’s charging infrastructure is ready for Thanksgiving travel. You can make sure you spent less time charging—and more time with loved ones—by following some best practices recommended by the firm’s experts.
According to Paren’s data, you’ll have the least competition at the charging station overnight, from midnight to 6 a.m. Afternoons will tend to be the worst, with one exception: If you can sneak out on Thursday afternoon, that may be one of the best times to juice up ahead of the ride home.
As opposed to last year, many non-Tesla EV drivers now have access to the company's formerly exclusive Supercharger network, giving them about 18,000 more plugs to choose from. You’ll need to have a vehicle that works with Superchargers (see the list of manufacturers here). And you’ll most likely need to have a manufacturer-approved adapter, something Ferro recommends keeping at the ready this week.
“That, to me, is just a huge game changer,” he said. “If I had a non-Tesla vehicle and I was going on a road trip anytime, including this week, I would have an adapter with me, and I would look to take advantage of that.”
A Tesla Cybertruck at a Supercharger.
Paren analyzed Tesla’s charger deployments this year and found that 91%—4,300 stalls—work with non-Tesla EVs. That includes some of its “Magic Dock” chargers, which any EV can use without an adapter.
Ferro recommends avoiding most fast chargers located at car dealerships, as they have some of the worst reliability scores. They’re often old, underutilized and can be blocked by other cars.
Charging stations along major corridors are most likely to work the best, said Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst, since they’re used regularly and earn money for their operators. However, they also may be the most slammed during busy travel times. The charging stations out in the middle of nowhere—ones that aren’t visited frequently—are more of a gamble, he said.
More Charging Stories
“The potential danger zone is if you’re out in Idaho or something like that, where it’s a small station operated by a regional player that gets one session, two sessions a day,” he said. “Nobody probably even knows if they’re working or not.”
Here are some other selected tips Paren shared that we’re passing on to you.
Charge to 100% before leaving for your trip. It may sound obvious, but if you have your car programmed to stop charging at 80%, as many do, here’s your reminder to adjust the limit ahead of time.
Precondition your car’s cabin while it’s plugged in. That way, you can warm up your car without sacrificing as much range. It takes a lot of energy to warm up a car from 40 degrees to a comfy 72. It requires less to maintain that temperature.
And treat your fellow EV drivers with respect. Only spend as much time plugged in as you absolutely need and keep it moving. That’ll give everyone something to be thankful for.

What Tesla Autopilot And Full-Self Driving Can And Can't Do,https://insideevs.com/news/742295/tesla-autopilot-abilities-fsd/,"Despite what Tesla often claims, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving still are not at an autonomous driving level. The cars cannot drive themselves.",2024-11-27 13:47:07,"Tesla’s success has been a major impetus behind the push toward electric vehicles. But the brand has been angling itself toward another, even more transformational shift: autonomous driving. Elon Musk has been predicting Level 5 autonomy was just around the corner since at least 2016 — and that Tesla vehicles were ready with the necessary hardware.
Tesla has charged more than $5,000 for features called “Enhanced Autopilot” and “Full-Self Driving.” And Tesla went as far as unveiling a driverless “Cybercab” robotaxi — coming before 2027 — earlier this year.
Tesla’s techno-optimism and terminology around autonomous driving have engendered confusion; the natural reaction to terms like Autopilot and Full-Self Driving is to take them literally. Prospective Tesla buyers and even knowledgeable owners can be misinformed — potentially dangerously — about what the vehicle they are driving is capable of.
To clarify matters, here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what Tesla’s driver assistance systems can and can’t do.
More Autopilot Info
Level 2 Self-Driving: Tesla’s Autopilot with Full Self-Driving is a Level 2 system. That means the vehicle can control steering within a marked lane (Autosteer) and adapt the vehicle’s speed (Traffic-aware cruise control) simultaneously. Consumer Reports describes Tesla’s Autopilot system as “middle of the pack” compared to other manufacturers.
Automated Lane Changes: A Tesla can assess the traffic situation and change lanes. Drivers can confirm the lane change with a tap of the turn signal in the appropriate direction. Drivers can disengage the confirmations. Navigate on Autopilot can maneuver Tesla into the proper lane through interchanges to follow a navigation route.
Summoning: Some Teslas offer a Summon feature. This feature allows owners to move the vehicle backward and forward — think into and out of a garage — remotely with the key fob. Tesla also introduced an “Actual Smart Summon” feature that lets an owner call the vehicle to them or another specified GPS point. The owner must be within 200 feet to Summon and can’t do so on public roads or in public lots.
Automatic Parking: Tesla’s Autopark system can detect perpendicular and parallel parking spaces at low speeds and control the braking, shifting and steering to maneuver the vehicle into those spaces.
Active Safety Features: Tesla offers many active safety features typically provided by other manufacturers including Automatic Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Obstacle Aware Acceleration, Blindspot Monitoring and Lane Departure warnings.
More On FSD
Drive Autonomously: No manufacturer has achieved Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy for road use. Tesla has not achieved Level 3 conditional autonomy like Mercedes-Benz’s DrivePilot system. A Tesla cannot drive itself. The driver must remain attentive at all times. Tesla now qualifies Autopilot and Full Self-Driving with a (Supervised) parenthetical on its website.
Hands-Free Driving: GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise allow the driver to go hands-free. However, Tesla’s Level 2 system is a hands-on system that requires the driver to regain control immediately. Torque sensors confirm the driver’s hands are on the wheel or yoke.
Level 2 Driving on City Streets: Tesla does list Autosteer on City Streets as a feature of Full-Self Driving. But notably, its website provides no further explanation of what that means. Tesla’s Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control — still officially in Beta — requires the driver to initiate or confirm essential functions like proceeding through an intersection and turning.
Remote Parking: The Smart Summon feature can bring a Tesla to a specific location. However, a summoned Tesla cannot automatically find a parking space and maneuver into it without a driver behind the wheel.
The short answer: nobody knows yet. Musk threw out a timeline of before the end of 2026 for the first Cybercab. However, Tesla is renowned for failing to meet initial target timelines. And that sounds like previous vague announcements Musk has been making for nearly a decade.
Tesla is more bullish on the timeline for autonomous driving than other manufacturers. Very broadly, Tesla believes it can get there with extant cameras on the vehicle and AI learning. Other significant players are approaching the issue with sophisticated and expensive LiDAR scanners, which could present a cost issue and limit the technology’s utility.
The other issue affecting the timeline is regulation. Musk’s influence with the Trump administration could help hasten that timeline. For instance, having a national standard for autonomous driving would be easier than obtaining approval state-by-state. Musk presumably could advise on the goalposts Tesla would have to meet to achieve that national standard.",Ty Duffy
Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",2024-12-25 01:26:15,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

Nissan's Situation Gets Dire: '12 Or 14 Months To Survive',https://insideevs.com/news/742456/nissan-hyundai-toyota-cm/,"Plus, Hyundai says it can win the EV war on ""quality,"" and Mexico is in a dilemma with its planned BYD factory.",2024-11-27 09:31:34,"As 2024 starts drawing to a close, it's more clear than ever that the business-as-usual era of the traditional auto industry is over.
You won't find just one reason for this. It's high interest rates and new car prices people can't afford, it's intensifying competition in once-lucrative China, it's consumer interest shifting to electrified cars and the high capital costs involved with making them... the list goes on. As we've seen with other industries in transitions, not every major player survives intact, and it may be time to start wondering who goes down first in the autos sector. Is Nissan due for such a reckoning?
That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of auto industry and tech news. Also on tap today: how Korea's Hyundai Motor Group plans to do battle against China's electric vehicle sector, and Mexico gets cold feet over a possible BYD factory as President Trump seeks to intensify a trade war before he's even back in office.
As a programming note, your hardworking InsideEVs staff will be on more limited duty over the next few days over Thanksgiving weekend. We'll resume normal service next week, and we wish you and yours a wonderful holiday in the meantime.
2023 Nissan Ariya E-4ORCE
I tend to think three big, traditional automakers took especially hard hits this year. The first two are Volkswagen and Stellantis, the poster children for the declining European auto sector and what happens when China sales stop paying the bills like they used to. The other is Nissan. Once, it was Japan's no. 2 automaker behind Toyota and an early pioneer in the EV space in its own right.
But Nissan has been in steady and unfortunate decline for years, having struggled with the ouster of the top boss who once held its shaky 25-year-old alliance with Renault together, a subsequent exodus of talent, a protracted renegotiation of that alliance and just taking its eye off the ball in terms of products when it was distracted by all of that chaos. Frankly, it's hard to fathom what's gone right for Nissan over the last few years. Profits were down a staggering 85% in Japan's Q2 of this year.
Now, Renault is in the process of offloading a substantial share of its stake in Nissan. And Nissan desperately needs a capital partner or its very survival is at stake, anonymous officials told the Financial Times:
Two people with knowledge of the talks said Nissan was seeking a long-term, steady shareholder such as a bank or insurance group to replace some of Renault’s equity holding, as Nissan finalises the terms of its new electric vehicle partnership with arch-rival Honda. “We have 12 or 14 months to survive,” said a senior official close to Nissan.
Nissan has not ruled out having Honda buy some of its shares, with “all options” being considered, as it launches a series of restructuring measures on the back of declining sales in both China and the US, the people said.
[...] After their capital recalibration last year, the French carmaker cut its Nissan holding to just under 36 per cent, including a remaining 18.7 per cent in a French trust, which it has been whittling down. Nissan gained voting rights for its 15 per cent stake in Renault, which will retain a 15 per cent voting stake in the Japanese group.
Ouch. As that story notes, Nissan sells no hybrid cars in the U.S. at present, though it once did. Yet hybrid cars are doing wonders for Toyota, Hyundai, Kia and even Ford at the moment; while the Ariya is a solid EV, Nissan's old-school internal combustion powertrains just aren't competitive in the 2020s.
You may recall that Nissan and Honda are forging a partnership to collaborate on future EV powertrains and software. They're doing so because Japan Inc. is pretty far behind China at making the EVs of the future, and they need to team up to win together; another burgeoning alliance to do the same is Toyota's team-ups with several smaller partners like Mazda.
The Nissan-Honda tie-up is a technical partnership, not a capital one. The story floats the idea that Honda (which has taken hits in China too but is doing much better overall) could step in as Nissan's new financial partner. But it's unclear if either side is into that, or if it would even be effective. And would Honda gain much there?
Since announcing their partnership in August, both Japanese companies had played down the possibility of a capital tie-up, with one person close to Nissan saying Honda buying a stake remained “a last resort”.
The people familiar with the matter said the outcome of the talks would present a test case for how companies could survive the industry upheaval, pitting the likes of Stellantis, which was born out of a megamerger, against smaller players such as Renault and Nissan that forge technology and regional partnerships. “Is bigger really better? Or is the partnership model better?” said the senior official close to Nissan, noting that pursuing scale would lead to inefficiency after a certain point.
None of this bodes well for Nissan. We're talking about long-term, capital-intensive businesses, so it's impossible to fathom a 12- to 14-month window where it can get a ton of great hybrids and EVs on the road and win back market share in the U.S. and China. My theory is we could see some kind of restructuring, asset sale or acquisitions in its future rather than an outright end to operations, but how Nissan navigates this next year is anyone's guess.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Meanwhile, Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is getting a lot right at the moment. Its EVs are selling remarkably well, especially in the U.S., and its extensive portfolio of hybrids are providing valuable cover fire. Yet from all I've heard and seen, including from my own team at InsideEVs, Hyundai's EVs still trail ones from China in terms of technology.
So how does Korea fend off that much larger competitor? Quality, its incoming global CEO José Muñoz told the Korea JoongAng Daily:
Muñoz also said “China is a big threat” to the global auto industry, but Hyundai can put up a challenge in the cutthroat industry with enhanced “technological prowess” and “quality.” “A lot of consumers, when they buy Chinese products, they realize maybe the quality is not as good as others. They are not happy with the quality, maybe [there is] a mechanical issue or [a problem] with the maintenance,” he said. “It is the moment to elevate our game in terms of providing not only the best quality but also the best services to our customers. We have been able to attract the best dealers in different countries investing with us and then investing in facilities with equipment and training to provide better service.""
The quality and reliability of the Chinese automakers is tough to gauge. By most accounts, they have gotten vastly better at those things in recent years. But without reliable long-term data in the U.S. (or even in Europe) it's hard to say. The Koreans do understand the scope of the threat they face, however; it's not like they haven't been dealing with that beef for literal centuries now.
BYD Mexico
Speaking of China's automakers, they've made huge inroads into Latin America, including just south of the Texas border. Chinese EV giant BYD has long sought a local factory in Mexico. It entered ""wait and see"" mode with that plant due to the U.S. election, as both the automaker and the Mexican government feared the escalation of a trade war with America.
Basically, BYD has insisted that any car factory in Mexico would be to serve the Latin American market. But it's a no-brainer that such a factory could one day be poised to export cars to the U.S. if trade conditions changed.
Enter: President Donald Trump, who isn't in office yet and is already firing shots at China and Mexico. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, BYD sounds like it wants to make this happen but Mexico is being especially cautious here:
The plans put Mexico in a dilemma, made worse by Trump’s threat Monday to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican goods. The country is already a major car manufacturing center and generally welcomes foreign investment for the jobs it brings. BYD, which rivals Tesla as the biggest electric vehicle maker in the world, would normally be a prize catch.
But Mexican officials fear a BYD plant would send the wrong message to Trump and the trade hawks around him by suggesting that Mexico wants to be a backdoor for Chinese companies to sell to Americans. The president-elect is also taking aim at Mexico over immigration and smuggling of fentanyl, the issues he cited in the tariff threat.
Mexico says it isn’t aiming to be a conduit for Chinese-made goods and has made strides in addressing illegal immigration. It needs to persuade the U.S. and Canada of that when talks begin next year on extending the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade reached during the first Trump administration.
[...] The federal government isn’t happy with BYD’s timing and doesn’t want to provoke Trump, said one Mexican official. Federal consent would be essential for any BYD project in Mexico because the company would need environmental and import permits as well as other government support.
I still believe BYD's entry into the U.S. market is a question of when, not if. But all parties involved have a new landscape to navigate.

This E-Bike Helped Me Rediscover My Home,https://www.rideapart.com/reviews/742033/aventon-aventure2-long-term-review/,Two pedals and an electric motor propelled me to explore new places that were there the entire time.,2024-12-25 01:26:16,"I’ve always enjoyed going for long walks. When I briefly held a desk job, I’d go for a stroll every day during my lunch break. On my motorcycle travels across the United States and around the world, some of my fondest memories are of exploring destinations on foot, even when exhausted after spending hundreds of miles in the saddle. When not traveling, I’ll explore local parks and forest preserves. A ten-minute drive to the library or post office? It’s a beautiful day, let’s turn that into an hour plus walk!
But modern life being what it is, time constraints left me somewhat limited to the nearest local trails and suburban sidewalks, and I wanted to explore further. We have plenty of preserves and trails in the Chicago area, but the idea of “driving somewhere to go for a walk,” emitting exhaust fumes and mentally absorbing the stress of traffic on either side of my trek through nature always felt hypocritical and somewhat counterproductive.
I could’ve taken a pedal bike, but I was never comfortable being associated with the established bicycle tribes. Between the Lycra-clad wannabe road racers, Critical Mass activists, and extreme mountain bike bros, there seems to be some real gatekeeping issues in the bicycling community, and I wanted no part of it. Additionally, while I’m in pretty good shape, I am by no means an athlete and some of the inclines on our local trails can be a bit daunting. I was looking for a mobility solution that existed adjacent to the realm of cycling. Something that could take advantage of cycling infrastructure, offering the benefits of biking without all the baggage.
Enter the Aventon Aventure.2.
The handsome styling is welcoming and unaggressive. Its rugged good looks are both tempered and accentuated by the pleasing curves of the frame and fenders, the satin green paint, and utilitarian luggage rack. Despite the almost cartoonishly fat tires, the proportions somehow work, and the Aventure.2 successfully exists comfortably in its own skin without pretense and carries none of the cycle-bro baggage. I ride in cargo pants and hiking boots so that at any moment, I can pull over, park the bike trail-side out of the way, and wander into the woods snapping wildlife and nature photos.
The hardcore bikers would say e-bikes aren’t real bikes, and I’m not a real cyclist, and to that I say “perfect.” In a world of five-figure pedal bikes, could this $2,000 e-bike be the egalitarian solution to two-wheeled (sub)urban mobility?
Sporting a 750w motor, 15Ah battery, and torque-sensing electric assist system with 4 levels: Eco, Tour, Sport, and Turbo, there is a genuine accessibility to “casual cycling” on offer here, presenting a solid and viable alternative to automotive transportation for those previously uninterested or unable to pilot a motorcycle or scooter, or to pedal a traditional bicycle.
About accessibility, the Aventure.2 is offered in two frame sizes: regular and large. We chose to experiment with our frame size selection. Despite my 6’2” height and 34-inch inseam placing me near the top end of the “Large” frame on Aventon’s size chart, we opted for the “Regular,” which my partner is near the bottom of on their size chart with her 5’3” height and 27-inch inseam.
There is actually enough adjustability with the seat post that both of us are happy astride the “Regular” sized frame. The saddle offers a good compromise that’s both supportive and comfortable enough for my skinny, thinly padded ass while never interfering with a smooth pedal stroke.
The bars are damn near perfect. Not too high and wide, nor overly low and aggressive, and offering plenty of leverage and front-end feel. The reach is just right, giving me a bit of forward lean with a slight bend in the elbows, mimicking my preference for Naked and Sport-Touring motorcycle ergos. The left thumb-operated throttle is intuitive and makes way more sense to me than a twist grip on an E-Bike. Just gotta remember – we’re on a bicycle, so the front brake is on the left!
Regarding range, I was never able to achieve Aventon’s claimed “up to 60 miles.” Fully-charged batteries reliably returned 37 miles before hitting 0%. This has been consistent over nearly 1,000 miles and a wide range of temperatures, using either ECO or Touring mode. Surfaces were mixed, split evenly between hard (concrete and asphalt) and soft (gravel and grass), and mostly level with some inclines ranging from gradual to steep.
Even in an attempt to extract maximum range—sticking exclusively to ECO mode and turning E-assist off on level ground, with the fat tires aired up to decrease rolling resistance, and always contributing pedal power—I would consistently deplete the battery at 37 miles. Turns out that Aventon’s claimed range is determined over flat terrain using a rider weight of 160 pounds. I’m a few pounds heavier than that, usually packing water, snacks, and camera equipment, and ascending some hilly terrain, so there you go.
Also, the battery gauge is not linear, giving a false sense of range when first setting off on a full charge. Below 20%, power delivery seems to be limited. At 10% and below, you’re practically in “limp-home mode.” With a nearly depleted battery, even the slightest incline becomes a real chore for the electric motor. Moderate or steep grades become simply impossible for the E-assist system, and you’ll be lugging all 77 pounds of the Aventure.2 up that hill exclusively on pedal power.
Once you understand these limitations, it just takes a bit of route planning to avoid leaving yourself on a super steep incline at the end of your ride. Fortunately, the 48-tooth crank and 8-speed rear derailleur with cogs ranging from 12-32 teeth offer plenty of ratios to make unassisted pedaling manageable in most conditions.
And that’s the great thing about e-bicycles. Unlike offerings from Cake or Ubco, which leave you helpless once the battery runs flat, an e-bike like the Aventure.2 gives you options. You can dial in as much electric assistance as you want, or none at all.
You want a strenuous workout? No problem. You want to take it easy? You got it. Just pin the throttle wide open and give your legs a rest. Oops, you miscalculated your route and ran the battery flat? Just pedal home using the traditional 8-speed rear derailleur to select the appropriate gear ratios along the way.
Assist settings can be adjusted on the fly using the d-pad-like control cluster on the left handlebar. Power mode, speed, mileage and other trip data are easily read on the backlit LCD full color display, which is bright enough for the sunniest days, and suffers no problems with glare.
Not interested in trail riding, and you want to use the Aventure.2 for a quick run to the shop? I’ve done that, too. The included standard rear rack appears to be compatible with the Ortlieb QL2.1 mounting hook system, giving you a wide selection of panniers to choose from. The E-assist helps me feel much less vulnerable sharing the road with cars versus riding a traditional pedal bike. The reduced speed differential and agility to quickly accelerate out of a dangerous situation is reassuring and confidence-inspiring.
Regarding speed, the Aventure.2 ships from the factory as a Class 2 e-bike, which limits electric assist to 20 mph. Aventon’s app (iOS or Android) allows you to quickly pair your device via a QR code on the bike’s LCD display. This app gives you the ability to enable Class 3 operation of the Aventure.2, so electric assist can be dialed up to a maximum of 28 mph.
A pop-up in the app warns users that doing so may violate local laws, so be sure to check the regulations pertaining to e-bikes within the jurisdiction you’ll be operating one.
Regardless of the assist level, there is no “speed limiter.” The calipers won’t automatically clamp down on the disc brakes. You can go as fast as you’re capable of on pedal power; you just won’t get any more thrust from the motor beyond the maximum setting. So far, I’ve gotten the Aventure.2 over 29 mph on a moderate downhill.

The Aventure.2’s battery also powers an LED lighting package comprised of rear running lights, brake lights, and indicators integrated into the frame just above the rear axle. There is a front headlight, but no front indicators. The headlight and turn signals are operated through the same d-pad control used to adjust e-assist levels and cycle through the trip computer.
The placement of the rear lights looks attractive and seems clever at first glance, but perhaps too clever for their own good. Their low placement can make them difficult for drivers to see and can be further obscured with panniers fitted to the rear rack.
E-bikes really seem to be where two-wheeled electrification makes sense. The overall practicality of this package makes for a legitimate contender as a car/motorcycle alternative for commuting, leisure, and light shopping runs.
The removable and quickly field-swappable battery pack opens a world of options for long-distance rides, as well as simplifying life for those who don’t have easy access to power where the bike is parked. Just pop the battery out, bring it in, and charge it at any regular household outlet. Makes a good theft deterrent too. Who would want to steal an e-bike without its proprietary $500 battery?

The Aventure.2 has given me the ability to go further and explore more of our local trails than I ever could have on foot. Like when I first got my motorcycle, I’ve found myself excited to ride, looking for reasons to take the e-bike out, scouring maps for new trails and different ways to get there.
Riding has given me a new appreciation for the little patch of the Earth I call home. The trails through our local forest and prairie preserves often feel magical, whether a disused old rail line tunneling through a lush green canopy of trees, or a gravel trail snaking its way through a sun-drenched expanse of tall prairie grass and native wildflowers.
Through riding, I’ve discovered an oasis of calm seclusion hidden right in the midst of our frenzied, chronically connected modern world. I’ve encountered wildlife I never would have otherwise met, watched vibrant hilltop sunrises overlooking mirror-like reservoirs, and snapped pictures that have reignited my interest in photography. I’ve started looking at my surroundings differently, and with a youthful fascination and excitement that this jaded Gen-Xer hasn’t felt in a long time.
The Aventure.2 is a fascinating dichotomy within itself, striking a charming balance between polar attributes. It accelerates your ability to explore your surroundings while slowing things down enough for you to appreciate them. It’s both cute and capable, welcoming yet rugged, confidently stylish while unpretentiously understated. I find myself grinning while riding it, and queried by smiling strangers curious to learn about it.
The Aventure.2 is the Suzuki Jimny of e-bikes, and I’m grateful at least one of them is available for purchase in my market.

Over Two Million EVs And PHEVs Have Been Sold In California Since 2011,https://insideevs.com/news/742436/2-million-ev-phev-california-since-2011/,More electrified cars were sold in California in the first nine months of 2024 than in the whole of 2022.,2024-11-27 06:36:18,"The state of California passed an impressive milestone after the third quarter of this year: Over two million plug-in electric vehicles have been sold in the Golden State since 2011. But that’s not all.
In total, 2,113,135 all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have been sold in California since 2011. That’s 38.8% of all the electrified cars sold in the United States in the last 23 years. Meanwhile, in the first nine months of this year, there were more battery-powered vehicles sold in California than in the whole of 2022, marking a clear upward trend for people’s appetite for zero- and low-emissions vehicles. Year-to-date, California recorded 343,213 EV and PHEV sales.
In the third quarter alone, California saw 115,897 EVs and PHEVs sold, while the entire country had 382,498 units get in customers' hands, according to data from public-private nonprofit Veloz. This means California alone amounts to 30.3% of the country’s electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, the electrified vehicle market share within California reached 26.4% in Q3.
More Stuff Like This
As for the best-selling battery-powered cars in California in Q3, the Tesla Model Y took the crown, followed by the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 5. Interestingly, the Toyota Rav4 Prime plug-in hybrid surpassed the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model X, while the Volkswagen ID.4 placed seventh. The top 10 list was completed by the BMW i4, Tesla Cybertruck and Jeep Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid.
To support the growing number of plug-in electric and hybrid vehicles roaming its roads, California has installed over 150,000 public and shared private EV chargers. As of August 2024, the state has 137,648 Level 2 chargers and 14,708 Level 3 DC fast chargers. Furthermore, over 500,000 private home chargers have been installed at homes across the state.",Iulian Dnistran
Kia Eyes PHEVs With 60 Miles Of Electric Range: Here In 'A Couple Of Years',https://insideevs.com/news/742393/kia-phev-60-miles-electric-range/,Kia’s current PHEVs can travel roughly 30 miles on electric power before switching on the gas engine.,2024-11-27 03:25:55,"Besides kicking things into high gear in the all-electric vehicle game, Kia also wants to increase its footprint in the plug-in hybrid vehicle market. Not only by offering more battery-assisted cars which are more fuel efficient if plugged in regularly, but also by upping the maximum range of these models while running on battery power.
Currently, Kia’s PHEVs can cover up to 34 miles on electricity with a full battery before kicking in the gas engine. This could be enough for drivers who only do short journeys and can recharge at home, but how would 60 miles of all-electric range sound?
That’s almost double the number available today. It would significantly open up the market to people who wouldn’t consider a battery-powered car otherwise. They could drive the car on electricity most of the time for the usual errands around town and then fill up the gas tank if a long trip is coming up.
More PHEV Stuff
With battery tech advancing at a rapid pace and new vehicle platforms designed to fit bigger battery packs for gas-powered cars, these 60-mile PHEVs might come in as little as “a couple of years,” according to Steven Center, Kia America’s chief operating officer and executive vice president, who spoke with Green Car Reports during the Los Angeles Auto Show.
The 60-mile figure came from an “engineering statistic,” Center said, and it relates to the total daily driving distance for Americans. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, people in the United States travel a nationwide average of 42 daily miles. This includes all forms of transportation, including personal vehicles, mass transit, biking and walking.
At the same time, a study from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland showed that 52% of all trips made by Americans in 2021 were shorter than three miles and just 2% of trips were longer than 50 miles. In this study, a trip was defined as a movement that includes a stay of longer than 10 minutes at a location away from home.
Reaching and even exceeding 60 miles of electric range on a PHEV isn’t impossible with today’s technology. Audi recently revealed the facelifted A3 hatchback in Europe–in plug-in hybrid guise, the 25.7-kilowatt-hour (19.7 kWh usable) battery enables a WLTP-rated electric range of 88 miles on a full charge. It can drive on electricity at up to 87 miles per hour and it also supports DC fast charging at up to 50 kilowatts.",Iulian Dnistran
"America Finally Got A Great, Cheap EV. Trump May Ruin It.",https://insideevs.com/news/742340/trump-tariffs-chevrolet-equinox-ev/,"The Chevy Equinox EV is the cheap, long-range EV America has been waiting for. Trump could make it more expensive.",2024-11-26 17:00:00,"Americans have been clamoring for an affordable, long-range electric car for years. Elon Musk shelved plans for a $25,000 Tesla—one that isn't a moonshot robotaxi, at least. But General Motors finally made one in 2024.
The automaker just launched the Chevrolet Equinox EV, a compact crossover with up to 319 miles of range and a starting price of $27,500, once you factor in the $7,500 federal incentive for electric purchases. Between its healthy EPA range rating, manageable price and solid technology, it's one of the best values the EV industry has ever seen—a vehicle with the potential to convince a lot more buyers on the fence to take the plunge into EVs.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox.
But not if President-elect Donald Trump has anything to say about it. His policy proposals around tax cuts and tariffs threaten to dull this EV breakthrough—or even erase it altogether.
Trump on Monday announced that, on his first day as president, he would sign an executive order to ""charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States."" Seeing as the U.S. auto industry relies heavily on manufacturing and supply chains in both neighboring countries, such a policy would wreak havoc on Ford, General Motors and a slew of other manufacturers. Many cars and their component parts would get more expensive to import, squeezing margins for automakers and likely jacking up prices for American drivers.
Honda makes the extremely popular Civic in Canada, where Toyota also churns out RAV4s. Ford makes its Maverick pickup south of the border. All of Tesla's EVs sold in the U.S. are made in California or Texas, but between 20% and 25% of their parts content (measured by value) originates in Mexico, per government filings. The tariffs would hit the Equinox EV, too, as GM produces it at its Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico.
Its $35,000 price point would be harder for the automaker to reach while actually turning a profit. GM currently loses money on its EVs and has assured Wall Street it expects profits to trickle in soon.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV.
The $7,500 EV tax credit, a longstanding policy aimed at jumpstarting America's EV market and manufacturing, is key to the Equinox EV's value proposition. Trump wants to do away with that too in order to pay for tax cuts, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Not all that many electric cars qualify for the full incentive, which requires both vehicles and their batteries to be made in North America. Battery components for qualifying vehicles also can't be traced back to China, a tough proposition given that country's utter dominance over EV supply chains. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, also made in Mexico, isn't eligible. But the Equinox EV is.
If Trump manages to enact these tariffs and kill the tax credit, the Equinox EV may get a whole lot more expensive for consumers. (A GM spokesperson declined to comment on the impacts of the tariffs and tax credit.) It's a shame because the little Chevy is, in many ways, the affordable EV America has been waiting for.
The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV.
Affordability has always been a key barrier keeping EVs from going truly mainstream, right up there with concerns around charging infrastructure and range. While prices have come down over the years as battery costs declined and manufacturers scaled up, they haven't dropped enough for everyday Americans. In October the average new EV changed hands for $56,902, per Kelley Blue Book. The going price for a Tesla was $56,705. These are not exactly prices anybody can stomach.
There were affordable electric options before, but they always required serious compromises. The Chevy Bolt EV and Bolt EUV could be had for under $30,000 and sold in large numbers because of it, but they were kneecapped by sluggish charging speeds. In InsideEVs' testing, the Bolt took a whopping 54 minutes to go from 25% to 75%.
The Nissan Leaf is a hatchback, a body style that's fallen out of favor.
The stalwart Nissan Leaf suffers from so-so range, slow charging speeds and a weird, outmoded charging connector. Plus, like the Bolt EV, it's a hatchback, a body style Americans have shunned in favor of crossover SUVs. The Equinox EV fixed many of those issues, delivering a relatively inexpensive EV that people might actually line up to buy. Indeed, in the Equinox EV's first full quarter on the market this year, GM sold nearly 10,000 of them.
We still don't know if these policies will come to pass. Trump will surely face pushback from the auto industry—maybe even from his new buddy Musk—as far as the tariffs are concerned. And carmakers are already urging him to keep the tax credit in place. If all goes according to plan, the EV market won't keel over and die. But the road to affordability could prove longer than the industry once imagined.

Trump's 25% Tariffs Would Hit These EVs The Hardest,https://insideevs.com/news/742353/trump-tariffs-hit-these-evs-hardest/,The President-elect has vowed to implement a sweeping tariff on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico.,2024-11-26 16:00:55,"President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to sign an executive order for a sweeping 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada when he takes office on January 20. Trump revealed the plan on Monday on his social media platform, Truth Social, and the move could disrupt global trade and potentially cause a significant blow to the U.S. EV market.
EVs are gaining momentum in the U.S. with automakers reporting consecutive quarters of record sales growth this year, driven by a wave of new, relatively affordable models. Now this growth risks stalling if Trump follows through his proposed tariffs. Several automakers, including General Motors, Tesla, Ford, Honda, BMW and Audi rely heavily on manufacturing facilities across the southern border, making them particularly vulnerable to a policy shift.
Popular EVs currently like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Honda Prologue undergo final assembly in Mexico. While Tesla manufactures its EVs in the U.S., some of their components are sourced from Mexico, according to public records posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). InsideEVs scanned these records to see which EVs and PHEVs could be the hardest hit.
This list covers model year 2024 EVs and PHEVs as many MY2025 cars are not listed yet. Regardless, the percentage of vehicle content sourced from other countries gives us an idea of how the tariffs may affect these EVs.
Cybertruck
Dodge Charger Daytona EV (Upcoming)
As you can see, Tesla isn't immune to these tariffs. Still, it remains to be seen whether Trump will make an exception for the automaker. CEO Elon Musk is set to head the new Department of Government Efficiency and has donated millions to Trump's campaign efforts.
Trump also said that he would increase tariffs on Chinese-made goods by a further 10%. The U.S. has already imposed a 100% tariff on EVs made in China and has also banned Chinese software from being used in cars sold stateside.
Some 2.55 million cars manufactured in Mexico were imported to the U.S. in 2023, as per researcher GlobalFleet. Now, the fear of tariffs making cars more expensive is sending shockwaves across the industry. Share prices of several U.S. and European automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota fell on Tuesday in the face of uncertainty.
Japanese and Korean EVs appear relatively more insulated from Trump's tariffs, but not entirely as they still source a small percentage of components from China. But on a more positive note, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now manufactured at Hyundai Motor Group's Metaplant in Savannah, Georgia. The Ioniq 6 is entirely made in Korea.
The Genesis G80 Electrified, GV60, Ioniq 5 N, Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia EV9 and Kia Niro EV appear to use a small percentage of Chinese components. The Toyota bZ4x and Lexus RZ also use a small percentage of Chinese parts but are predominantly manufactured in Japan.
So if Trump goes through with his America-first tariffs, the big winners will be South Korean and Japanese automakers. It'll be American EVs, trucks and SUVs that will bear the brunt of the new duties.

"Rivian CEO Says The Tesla Model Y Is Still The Best EV Under $50,000",https://insideevs.com/news/742302/rivian-ceo-tesla-model-y-best/,"The Model Y sets the bar, according to Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe.",2024-11-26 15:00:03,"There's no denying the fact that the Tesla Model Y is the best-selling electric car in the world, but is it the best electric car available today? If we add ""for under $50,000"" to that question, then the answer seems to be a ""yes,"" according to Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe.
If we take Elon Musk and Tesla out of the equation and just focus on the car, we here at InsideEVs tend to agree with Scaringe. Some of our staff believe that the Hyundai Ioniq 5 comes in at a close second to the Model Y in the ""best EV for under $50,000"" category, but there are some other choices out there.
Best Cheaper EVs
Back to Scaringe for a moment. At a roundtable we attended at the LA Auto Show, Scaringe talked a bit about Tesla. Regarding Tesla, he said ""The world doesn't need another one of those,"" which kinda seems to paint a negative on Tesla but that's more connected to Tesla's massive market share, which gives it strong control over suppliers. Scaringe went on to say that  ""We think Tesla has done an amazing job. It's a great brand; they have great products.""
How good are Tesla's products? Considering that Scaringe has owned both a Tesla Model 3 and a Model Y, we'd have to say that Rivian's CEO is very fond of Tesla's cars. Scaringe added that there ""less than five highly compelling choices"" among electric cars that are priced under $50,000 and concluded that the Model Y is the bar-setter among this small group of EVs.
Tesla Alternatives
In the near future, Scaringe will probably prefer a couple of other sub-$50,000 EVs over the Model Y. That's because Rivian has a few more affordable EVs on the horizon, including the R2, R3 and R3X, all of which should start at under $50,000. Rivian's current offerings, including the R1T and R1S, are priced well above $50,000, even despite recent price cuts.

Tesla Has All These Covered Cars At Its Factory. What Are They?,https://insideevs.com/news/742329/tesla-seen-benchmarking-polestar-volvo/,"Eight vehicles are hidden under tarps at Tesla's Fremont factory, but we’re not sure what we’re looking at.",2024-11-26 12:00:00,"Tesla is very different from the traditional automakers, but in one key way it’s exactly the same: it buys competitors’ vehicles to benchmark them and reverse-engineer their innovations. A recent drone video shows eight cars under white tarps parked in a line outside the Fremont, CA factory test track, and likely that none of them are Teslas.
The drone video uploaded by Met God in Wilderness (and spotted by Electrek) shows eight cars covered by white tarps. Seven of them are crossovers, and one looks like a low-slung car, possibly a sedan or a fastback. Upon closer inspection, at least two of the crossovers are definitely appear to be Polestar 3s, based on the shape of their roof.
Another two might be Volvo EC40s, which have a more pronounced fastback-like rear end but also appear more squared off in the rear compared to a Tesla Model Y.
It would make sense to have vehicles from both Volvo and Polestar, which use the same platforms and powertrains in different vehicles. Regarding the low-slung car, our best guess is that it could be an Audi E-Tron GT or a Porsche Taycan, both of which were refreshed this year with a lot more power, range and bigger batteries.
We don’t think any of the crossovers are the Model Y “Juniper” refresh since that won’t change the shape of the body to such an extent. The rear end looks a lot more square than the tapering fastback-like roof of either the Model Y or Model X.
Tesla is reportedly working on a new platform internally designated NV9X, which will be used to underpin several future vehicles. The first of these is a crossover currently only known as Project Redwood, but Tesla would likely do a better job of keeping a Redwood prototype out of sight. The same platform will likely underpin the Model S replacement if one is even coming, but we doubt that’s the car under the tarp.
More On This
The fact that all these covered cars were spotted next to the test track further strengthens the idea that they were brought there for benchmarking purposes. Tesla is likely analyzing the competition, which has become much stiffer over the last few years, and the EV segment is only going to get more competitive. Back in April 2022, a Lucid Air was spotted doing laps of the Fremont test track fully uncovered.
Automakers do this all of the time; this year alone, the InsideEVs staff has seen a few Chinese EVs at the facilities of Detroit's Big Three automakers.
However, that was one of the rare instances when Tesla was caught benchmarking another manufacturer’s car. It was usually the other way around: other manufacturers were seen benchmarking Teslas, drawing knowledge for their own EV projects. However, now that so many manufacturers are producing EVs that not only rival but even surpass Tesla’s own, seeing the tables turn isn’t the least bit surprising.",Andrei Nedelea
Finally: This Kit Adds Apple CarPlay To General Motors' EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/742325/wams-carplay-kit-ev-ultium/,White Automotive & Media Services says it can add full-featured Apple CarPlay—and Android Auto—to most GM Ultium cars.,2024-11-26 10:54:22,"General Motors has pigheadedly stuck to its guns for its new EVs by omitting Apple CarPlay in its new software setup. Some of my colleagues have been mostly fine with the omission, but by and large, the public’s reaction to GM’s lack of Apple CarPlay hasn’t been great.
In fact, I can’t help but wonder if part of the reason the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX are mildly successful is because they’re essentially GM EVs with Apple Carplay and Android Auto, but I digress.
But now people who want to stick with Chevy or Cadillac or GMC have options, thanks to the aftermarket company White Automotive & Media Services (WAMS). This aftermarket kit adds Apple CarPlay back to the EVs, and it looks pretty good.
No, really—it looks pretty stock. The WAMS CarPlay kit allows GM Ultium cars to use CarPlay in whatever native resolution they need to be. In models like the Silverado EV, Equinox EV or Blazer EV, the CarPlay interface naturally uses most of the nearly 18-inch screens found in those cars. For the GMC Sierra EV’s square-shaped screen, the CarPlay and Android Auto resolutions follow suit and fit neatly into the correct aspect ratio and layout.
It’s not just for aesthetics, either. WAMS says the CarPlay kit gives OEM-level full functionality, akin to CarPlay use in any other GM vehicle. It is wireless (or wired, depending on the model). It can pass the “now playing” song list to the vehicle’s main gauge cluster. The company says it can do turn-by-turn directions via Apple Maps—all displayed on the car’s HUD, if so equipped.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite interior
I’m curious as to how this works exactly. When I was on the Prologue launch earlier this year, Honda’s engineers were adamant that the Android-based software in use on the Prologue (and ZDX) isn’t all that dissimilar to what GM is using on its variants of the Ultium-based crossovers. To me, this tells me that GM’s lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto likely only needs a flip of a switch somewhere in the backend to turn it back on. I mean, look at how intentional the CarPlay sync menus look, almost as if they were developed to completion before GM decided to nix CarPlay and Android Auto later in their development.
WAMS hasn’t exactly said how the CarPlay kit works, nor have they released a price yet. Similarly, it's not clear if this CarPlay addition will alter the warranty when installed, or block the car from OTA updates. Also, WAMS says it’s only available for installation at LaFontaine Chevrolet in Plymouth, MI.
We’ve reached out to WAMS and GM for comment. In the meantime, WAMS is already open for bookings, and information about the CarPlay kit is on its website.

I Want To Go Off-Grid In Kia's PV5 WKNDR Electric Van,https://insideevs.com/news/742301/kia-wkndr-ev-van-laas/,"Kia's electric van concept is at the LA Auto Show, and believe me when I say it should exist for real.",2024-11-26 10:30:00,"Falling in love with a concept car is setting yourself up to fail. The vast majority of them never become real vehicles, and those that do often end up disappointingly far from their striking original designs. For every BMW i8, we also get about 50 Pontiac Azteks. But love isn't a rational thing, and that's why I want to believe Kia's PV5 WKNDR electric van concept could somehow become a reality.
The PV5 WKNDR made its first appearance at SEMA, the giant aftermarket and performance trade show, earlier this month. But I got to see it for myself last week at the LA Auto Show. And like a good movie, book or album, the fact that I'm still thinking about it a few days later tells me a lot.
The EV9 ADVNTR EV SUV and PV5 WKNDR EV Van
The concept is a #vanlife take on Kia's new Platform Beyond Vehicle program: a family of modular electric work vehicles in different sizes and configurations. Kia has big plans for that program as it expands into the commercial vehicle space; some of the ideas there are pretty wild, including transforming body types, autonomous driving and possibly even crab-walking wheels to deliver cargo to tight areas. We don't know how far Kia will go with those technologies yet, but the Korean automaker clearly wants in on the nascent electrified delivery van and commercial vehicle space.
By comparison, the PV5 WKNDR is almost conventional. But it shows how well this platform could exist when repurposed for a consumer van aimed at off-road and off-grid adventuring. Kia describes it as ""an escape pod for extended weekends in nature"" and ""a Swiss Army Knife on wheels."" That's not only because of the big off-road tires, but because the whole interior has been customized to be a kind of mobile living space: the concept comes complete with lounge seats, camping chairs, tables, an extending rooftop tent and more. And you get towing hooks front and rear if other vehicles go sideways, or upside-down, in this case.
The EV9 ADVNTR EV SUV and PV5 WKNDR EV Van
While I didn't get to see Kia demonstrate this on-site at the auto show, the van also features solar panels for offboard charging and ""hydro turbine wheels"" that generate electricity while spinning. That's a clever idea and I'd love to see it get applied to some actual production cars. In fact, this whole concept makes a strong case for an electric off-road machine: when EVs are stationary, they can provide massive amounts of electricity to power campsites, devices and even entire homes. If you apply that idea to a bigger vehicle (with a bigger battery) you can enable a ton of zero-emission power when you go camping. I think Kia's onto something with this concept, and I hope the automaker finds some way to make it a reality.
If you find yourself at the LA Auto Show's public days until the end of this month, go pay this thing a visit. I think you'll get a kick out of it.

Rivian Gets $6.6 Billion Loan To Supercharge Its New Georgia Plant,https://insideevs.com/news/742226/rivian-6-billion-loan-doe/,"Plus, NHTSA moves automatic emergency braking mandate forward and the EU isn't any closer to a deal with China over tariffs.",2024-11-26 09:49:56,"It's not easy to build cars, and more importantly, it takes a ton of cash to do it. Thankfully, the U.S. government seems to be willing to shell out cash to startups that it sees potential in. The latest to receive billions of dollars of government loans is Rivian, and it's another lifeline that will be welcome for the startup automaker.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Rivian's new $6.6 billion loan to kick-start its new factory, federal mandates on safety tech, and the ongoing tariff battle in the EU. Let's jump in.
Rivian's goal to become a household name is being supercharged thanks to the awarding of a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's—stay with me here—Loan Programs Office Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. The EV startup announced late Monday night that it has received conditional approval for the loan which it plans to use as the funding source to restart construction on its new $5 billion manufacturing plant in Georgia.
A huge cash infusion like this is Rivian's key to wrapping up its much-needed factory expansion. The automaker first announced its plans to build the production facility back in 2021 with plans of manufacturing its next-generation R2 and R3 vehicles on-site. However, Rivian announced earlier this year that it was delaying the factory and would begin production of the R2 in Normal, Illinois instead—a move which concerned investors and set off a stock slump that has since reversed course as folks gain more confidence with Rivian's latest government-sourced lifeline.
Here's what Rivian has to say about its loan:
If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets.
This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.
The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.
Specifically, the loan would enable Rivian to press play on the factory by 2028, kicking off the first phase of vehicle production with an annual output of an estimated 200,000 vehicles per year—or around four times the number of vehicles it sold in 2023. The second phase will kick off the production of another 200,000 vehicles, bringing the total annual output of the Georgia plant to 400,000 vehicles and the number of jobs needed to sustain the production to 7,500.
Other companies to be awarded loans as part of the DOE's funding process are Tesla, Ford (in its joint venture with SK), and Redwood Materials.
You might have already put this together, but this loan is the key for Rivian to solidify the future of the brand. Skeptics have wondered if Rivian had enough cash (and drive) to stick out the critical launch of the R2 and R3—this loan will certainly help with the brand's cash crunch and potentially enable Rivian to see if it can thrive with a great product. Fortunately for Rivian, the brand has already seen an influx of buyers ditching their Teslas over the antics of its CEO, so the demand appears to be there for the R2's inevitable launch.
For now, Georgia is a beacon of hope for Rivian—a real one, at that. It's a glimpse of what could be and the approval for the loan should put investors, fans, and the auto industry a bit at ease to know that the U.S. government is still supporting EV companies amid a rocky political climate. And if Rivian can play this fiddle just right, it might just outplay its own cash-laden devils.
Self-driving tech is all the rage right now. Automakers are touting it as a miracle for vehicle safety, and the industry simply can't light cash on fire fast enough to be the first company to solve the problem. However, when it comes to government mandates on safety tech? Well, that makes those very same companies throw an absolute tantrum.
The latest flare-up has been around the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal to require all new cars to be equipped with Automatic Emergency Braking. This controversial topic has been hounded by the auto industry—but Uncle Sam refuses to pump the brakes on the would-be mandate and will push forward with the requirement after all.
Automakers aren't arguing about whether or not cars should have AEB or not. Most of them already agreed to make it a standard feature back in 2016. The issue comes with measurable performance goals established by the feds after Congress directed NHTSA to evaluate and establish minimum performance criteria for certain safety features like AEB in 2021. This includes avoiding collisions at speeds up to 62 miles per hour and also recognizing (and avoiding) pedestrians at night.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation—an industry trade group that represents heavy hitters in the auto industry like Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota, and just about everyone else—even said that requiring all cars to have AEB up to 62 MPH was ""practically impossible with available technology.""
""[The decision is] wrong on the merits. Wrong on the science,"" said AAI CEO John Bozzella, who urged President-elect Donald Trump to reassess the mandate. ""Really a disastrous decision by the nation’s top traffic safety regulator that will endlessly—and unnecessarily—frustrate drivers; will make vehicles more expensive and at the end of the day won’t really improve driver or pedestrian safety.""
To Bozzella's point, AEB tech isn't that great. Teslas and Hondas have been notorious for phantom braking events, so much so that NHTSA themselves have even been investigating the problem. The question is whether the issue is the hardware stack, software implementation, or limitations in a mix of both. Either way, automakers would have to dump R&D into solving the problem to meet the new requirements, which could end up costing consumers more money in the long run.
NHTSA still believes that the move is the right way to go. The feds say that the mandate will help to save at least 360 lives and prevent at least 24,000 injuries each year by the time it goes into effect in 2028.
Europe and China have been deep in negotiations over EV tariffs. Both sides are bringing their best negotiators to the table with Europe fighting over what could happen to their automotive industry should a wave of cheap Chinese EVs crash into the bloc, and China arguing for their right to free trade.
Last week, news outlets learned through a reputable source that the EU and China were supposedly close to an agreement that would resolve an ongoing tariff dispute between the two parties. However, EU officials revealed that behind the curtain, the two competing countries are essentially at a stalemate with little progress being made and no short-term solution in sight.
From Reuters:
Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament's trade committee, told a German broadcaster on Friday that an agreement between the 27-nation EU and China to replace the tariffs with something else was close. But EU officials, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks with Beijing said this was not correct, because while the talks were continuing, there were still stumbling blocks that prevented a deal.
China is pretty pissed right now. The country has invested billions into becoming an EV manufacturing powerhouse, and EV makers are pumping out sub-$20,000 EVs with ease. But, as the EU argues, China's automakers are able to do that thanks to ""unfair subsidization"" which put the auto industry in the Germany, Italy, and other bloc members at risk. If domestic players are unable to compete with costs—especially labor-related expenses—China's wave of affordable EVs will drown the competition. And that could wreak havoc on one of the EU's biggest industries.
Enter tariffs: the protectionist measure meant to artificially inflate the cost of imported cars to ensure they are competing in a similar price bracket to the EU's domestic offerings. The U.S. and Canada recently slapped China with additional import tariffs tallying 100%. However, the EU only added extra tariffs of up to 35.5%—but it's under fire because it unevenly applied these duty fees across the industry based on how willing car makers were cooperating in an investigation into subsidies.
China has since threatened to slap the EU with retaliatory tariffs on goods like pork, wine, and other luxury items, meaning that other industries could suffer to protect the cars.
That all being said, the standoff over tariffs continues. The EU is wrestling with the struggle of how to protect car brands under its protection while China wants its own shot to expand its footprint as an automotive powerhouse beyond its borders. For the public, this should serve as a snapshot of something bigger: the world sees the shift to EVs happening and whatever players dominate the market early will have a significant advantage in the long run.
While the feds are fighting the battle for safety features like AEB, I started thinking about what other in-car features have spread like wildfire across the industry. We're not just talking about gimmicky things like light-up emblems or gigantic TV-sized touch screens. There have been significant advancements in quality-of-life features across new cars over the past decade.
Some might argue for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; the auto industry might not agree. Others will say ADAS systems with great lane keeping (I know that a great-performing system is on my checklist). Or, how about phone-as-a-key? So many options.
So now I need to know your pick: what is the must-have feature in any new car? Let me know in the comments.

This EV Motorcycle Maker Wants To Produce 3D-Printed Bikes,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741888/stark-future-partners-farsoon-technologies-3d-printing/,The goal is to make high-performance components more accessible.,2024-12-25 01:26:21,"I remember when 3D printers started becoming popular. Back then, I remember thinking just how cool this tech would be, and that sooner or later, we’d be able to print all sorts of interesting stuff we could only dream of.
Fast forward to today, and this is pretty much the reality. I’m sure a lot of you have at least a couple of 3D-printed knick-knacks lying around. I use a bunch of them on a near-daily basis, such as my action camera mount on my helmet, or some spacers I use on my bike rack.
But what about actual serious stuff? What about motorcycle parts?
Well it seems that this is already a reality, and we’ll soon be seeing more of it in an industry that’s seeing an increasingly electric future. Stark Future, the makers of the high-performance Varg off-road EV motorcycle, is among the first to integrate 3D printing tech into its manufacturing processes—or at least it hopes to be.
You see, Stark Future has entered into a strategic partnership with Farsoon Technologies, a company specializing in industrial 3D printing. And of course, this company’s 3D printing expertise goes way beyond anything the 3D printer you have in your basement is capable of doing.
3D printing tech quite literally has the potential to make all sorts of crazy components in intricate shapes and patterns no other manufacturing technique can produce. And in the case of Stark Future, it’s eyeing advanced large-format metal powder bed fusion technology—quite a mouthful, but in laymans’ terms, it’s essentially titanium 3D printing. Pretty sick, right?
In fact, Stark Future’s CEO Anton Wass has high hopes for titanium 3D printing, and how it can not only make high-performance components more accessible, but also reduce their production time in the process. “Stark strongly believes that mass production of Titanium 3D printing is a natural next step in producing better motorcycles,” he said.
Stark aims to produce 3D printed components using Farsoon's FS721M-H-8-CAMS, which is essentially an industrial 3D titanium printer.
Stark Future’s main investment in Farsoon’s tech is a machine called the FS721M-H-8-CAMS large-format metal 3D printing system. This thing has a 750 x 420 x 650 mm (29 x 16 x 26 inch) build cylinder that allows the production of some pretty big components. And while it’s nowhere nearly big enough to actually print a whole motorcycle, well, at this point, it’s really just a matter of time.
3D printing in high-performance applications is nothing new. In fact, 3D-printed components can be found all over F1 cars, MotoGP bikes, and even on equipment used by NASA on space missions. So yeah, clearly 3D printing is fast becoming a mainstream production method.
Nevertheless, the idea of having printed components on a motorcycle seems pretty wild to me—even if said components are printed out of titanium and have been proven and tested in the most rigorous of environments. But hey, the future is well and truly now, and if all this new tech will bring about badass and fun-to-ride bikes, then I’m all for it.

All The Non-Tesla EVs That Can Use Tesla Superchargers (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/735724/non-tesla-ev-tesla-supercharger-access/,We’ve gone from just a handful of cars to dozens. And the list keeps getting longer every month.,2024-11-26 08:02:13,"The Tesla Supercharger network is no longer exclusive to Tesla EV owners, whether you like it or not. It all started at the end of February 2024, when Ford EVs gained access to what is generally known as the best and most reliable DC fast-charging network in North America.
Rivian and General Motors came after Ford, with many more manufacturers–almost all, in fact–working with Tesla to give their customers access to an additional 17,000 or so DC fast chargers. That’s a big win for non-Tesla EV owners, especially those who like to go on long road trips.
But what cars can be plugged into a Tesla Supercharger right now? You’ve come to the right place because this article will tell you exactly that. We’ll update this piece as more and more manufacturers gain access to the Supercharger network. Also worth mentioning is this only applies to North America–Europe, China, Japan and other markets use different charging standards.
More Stories Like This
We’ll start with Ford, seeing how it was the automaker that convinced Tesla to open up its Supercharger network. Then, we’ll move on to Rivian and General Motors, followed by the other automakers that have announced deals with Tesla.
Before we dig in, you should know that owners of non-Tesla EVs that are equipped from the factory with the Combined Charging System 1 (CCS1) port will need an adapter to be able to top up at a Tesla Supercharger. That’s because Tesla EVs use the North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and the Supercharger network was originally designed for them.
Some car manufacturers are offering free adapters, while others are asking for money for them. There are also adapters made by third parties, but bear in mind that they’re not OEM-approved.
A charging adapter like this one made by Tesla is needed to use the Supercharger network if your car has a CCS1 port.
Most automakers have said that starting in 2025, they’ll fit a NACS port on their U.S.-bound vehicles from the factory. The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of those vehicles, and so is the upcoming Rivian R2 and 2025 Kia EV6. This means an adapter will no longer be needed to recharger at Tesla stalls, but a different kind of adapter–CCS1 to NACS–will be required to charge at CCS1 fast chargers such as those operated by Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and others.
Tesla also has a handful of Supercharger stalls in the United States fitted with something called a Magic Dock connector. These essentially have a CCS1 adapter built-in and are open to all EVs, not just those on this list. Moreover, it’s worth noting that not all Superchargers can be used by non-Tesla EVs, but only V3 and V4 units that have a black collar around the charging handle.
Ford F-150 Lightning At Tesla Supercharger
Non-Tesla EV customers don’t need the Tesla smartphone app to charge at Superchargers. Instead, the automaker’s own app–like MyChevrolet or the Rivian app–is used. Owners must first associate a payment method with the car before charging, but after that, they’re good to go.
The first non-Tesla automaker to gain access to the Supercharger network in North America, Ford is shipping complimentary adapters to its customers. Sometime next year, Ford EVs will ditch the CCS1 port for a NACS connector.
Neither the Ford Focus Electric nor any plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Ford can use the Tesla Supercharger network because they can’t be DC fast-charged.
Rivian is currently shipping free charging adapters to owners of the R1S and R1T. New vehicles also come with an adapter included. Starting next year, new models will be equipped with a NACS port instead of a CCS1 connector.
The Rivian Electric Commercial Van cannot use Tesla Superchargers, as Rivian’s deal with Tesla only includes retail-oriented vehicles.
GM is selling an official adapter to owners of its EVs. Starting next year, GM’s electric vehicles are slated to incorporate the NACS connector from the factory.
The Chevrolet BrightDrop cannot use Tesla Superchargers, as GM’s deal with Tesla only includes retail-oriented vehicles.
The Chevrolet Spark EV and the Chevrolet Volt cannot be recharged at Tesla Superchargers.
The Volvo EX30 cannot currently use Tesla Superchargers. Plug-in hybrid Volvo models also cannot use the Tesla Supercharger network because they come with a J1772 charging port which is only used for Level 2 AC charging.
Hyundai said its EVs will get access to Tesla's Supercharger network either in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025. Current and future models with a CCS charging port will get access early next year, while updated models with a NACS port from the factory should receive access by the end of this year.
Hyundai Motor Group’s luxury brand said its all-new and updated EVs will come with a Tesla NACS port from the factory starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Beginning in the first quarter of next year, owners of CCS-equipped EVs will gain access to the Supercharger network.
All the other automakers that have deals with Tesla said their customers will gain access to the Supercharger network in 2025, but details are slow to emerge. As of this writing, the following brands are yet to offer a concrete timeline for the rollout:
Sony and Honda’s first EV will go on sale next year with Tesla’s NACS port fitted from the factory.
BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce EVs sold in the United States will come with a NACS port from the factory early next year. There’s no official word on when an adapter will become available for CCS1-equipped vehicles.
Honda EVs that are already on sale in the U.S. feature the CCS1 charging port, and the company said customers will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network next year with the help of an adapter. Honda’s upcoming EVs will feature the NACS port from the factory.
The British automaker said it’s starting from a clean slate. It’s stopping production of all its current models and focusing on the launch of its all-electric lineup, which will start rolling out in 2026. Owners of the discontinued I-Pace electric crossover will be offered an adapter starting next year and will be able to use Tesla Superchargers.
Lexus owners will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network in 2025. Current owners will get an adapter, while new models will be fitted with the NACS port from the get-go.
The American startup’s future EVs will come from the factory with a NACS charging port, starting with the Gravity SUV, which is slated to go on into production later this year. Adapters will be offered to Lucid Air owners and the Tesla Supercharger will welcome them starting in 2025.
Mazda doesn’t sell an EV anymore in the United States after the demise of the MX-30, but it said it will launch a new battery-powered car here in 2025 that will get the NACS port from the factory.
The German automaker said it will offer charging adapters to current EV owners by the end of 2024, although that hasn’t happened yet. Starting next year, U.S.-market EVs will get the NACS port from the factory.
The Japanese automaker said drivers of the Ariya crossover would get an adapter this year and that next year, the Ariya will be fitted with a native NACS port. The Leaf EV can’t use the Tesla Supercharger network as there is no manufacturer-approved CHAdeMO adapter for it.
Auto giant Stellantis said at the beginning of 2024 that it would adopt the NACS charging port on select models in 2025. Adapters will be offered during the transition period but currently, we don’t know what cars will get the NACS connector.
Subaru only makes one EV at the moment–the badge-engineered Solterra that’s a Toyota underneath. Owners of the Solterra will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network next year and the upcoming American-made three-row electric crossover (also developed with Toyota) will get the NACS connector instead of a CCS1 plug.
Like Lexus, Toyota intends to offer a charging adapter to bZ4X owners in the United States, while new electric models that will be launched in 2025 will get the NACS connector from the factory.
Audi, Porsche, Scout Motors and Volkswagen electric vehicles sold in the United States will include a NACS charging port from the factory starting next year. Charging adapters for older cars will be available at dealerships, but the timeline hasn’t been disclosed.",Iulian Dnistran
New BMWs And Minis Are Driving Themselves Off The Assembly Line,https://insideevs.com/news/742257/bmw-mini-autonomous-driving-factory/,"What began as a pilot program in 2022 is now a fully operational system at two BMW factories, with more to come.",2024-11-26 03:47:38,"Thousands of brand-new BMWs are rolling off the assembly lines every day without a driver behind the wheel.
That’s because the German luxury automaker has fully implemented an autonomous driving system that allows finished vehicles to drive themselves on a predefined course inside the factory.
The system, called Automated Driving In-Plant (AFW), debuted as a pilot program in 2022 at BMW’s largest European factory in Dingolfing. Now, however, the system has evolved and is ready for series production duty, according to the German carmaker.
More Stuff Like This
Initially, the autonomous driving setup was used on the latest generation i5 and i7 electric sedans assembled in Dingolfing, but now that the system is ready for prime time, other BMW models, as well as the new Mini Countryman, will be ferried around the factory without a driver behind the wheel.
In addition to the Dingolfing factory, the company is implementing the system at its Leipzig factory where around 90% of the models assembled will be driven autonomously off the assembly line. After Leipzig, the Regensburg plant in Germany and the Oxford factory in the United Kingdom will also get AFW next year. The new Hungarian factory in Debrecen that will build the next-generation iX3 electric crossover is next in line to get the self-driving tech.
At the main Dingolfing site, freshly assembled cars drive without anyone behind the steering wheel along a route of more than 0.62 miles (1 kilometer). The cars begin their autonomous drive from the two assembly halls, go through a “short test course” and arrive at the finishing area inside the same facility.
“Over the next ten years, we will log several million test kilometers with Automated Driving In-Plant in our production network alone,” said  Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “In this way, the BMW Group is once again setting a new benchmark for automation and digitalization of its production processes – while paving the way for future applications in the field of autonomous driving.”
The Automated Driving In-Plant system uses a series of sensors installed along the route and relies on an externally generated environment model, as well as an external movement planner. BMW says the system is the largest Lidar infrastructure in Europe and that the next step is to introduce it to other areas of production, like driving through more testing zones and outdoor distribution areas.",Iulian Dnistran
Rivian R1T Tows Big Rig Out Of The Mud To Save The Day,https://insideevs.com/news/742248/rivian-r1t-tows-truck-mud/,"When the towing company and the truck driver are out of options, an electric pickup comes to the rescue.",2024-11-26 02:33:45,"One of the great things about electric cars is that they offer all their torque from a standstill, as opposed to combustion engines that have to be in a specific rev range to give everything they have. Couple that with the manufacturers’ ability to fit up to four electric motors on a single vehicle, and you have a great recipe for an EV that can move big things with little to no effort.
Here’s where the Rivian R1T enters the conversation. It’s one of the best all-rounder electric pickups out there, with up to four electric motors, a maximum towing capacity of 11,000 pounds, great on-road handling and a bunch of well-thought-out features like the lockable Gear Tunnel that acts as a sort of trunk.
So with that in mind, the owner of a Rivian R1T decided to save the day by rescuing a semi-truck that was stuck in the mud and was blocking a street outside his home. Ken Kring, who used to work at Rivian, said in a post on LinkedIn that the towing company that was called to sort things out couldn’t assist and the driver of the big rig was out of options.
More Electric Pickup Stuff
Kring decided to get out his freshly unpacked recovery gear, hook up the R1T to the back of the trailer and gently pull it out of the mud. And it worked like a treat, as you can see in the video embedded below.
It’s worth mentioning that the truck driver could have separated the trailer from the cab to make it easier to get out of the mud, but in the end it was easier and faster to just use the Rivian R1T as the recovery weapon of choice.
“This moment isn’t just about towing—it’s about what EVs are capable of today,” Kring said. “Vehicles like mine, built with care and precision by the amazing team at Rivian in Normal, IL, are proving their value in the real world every day. From towing to road trips to winter weather, these trucks can do it all—and then some.“",Iulian Dnistran
Hyundai Is About To Have More EVs With NACS Plugs Than Tesla,https://insideevs.com/news/742221/hyundai-kia-genesis-nacs-charging/,"The automaker has a big leg up over rivals: Five EVs with Tesla's charging port coming soon from Hyundai, Kia and Genesis.",2024-11-25 17:57:33,"The Hyundai Motor Group has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest challengers to Tesla’s EV dominance. It’s still a distant second in terms of U.S. EV sales. But the South Korean automaker is nipping at Tesla’s heels in another way: Electric models equipped with Tesla’s charging port design, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
HMG’s brands—that’s Hyundai, Kia and Genesis—are about to sell as many NACS-equipped models as Tesla itself does. It’s a signal that the auto industry-wide migration to NACS from the older standard is well underway. And HMG is leading the charge.
“A massive barrier to entry is infrastructure accessibility, so I think it was kind of an easy one to say, ‘Hey, if we’re going to do it, let’s do it quick,’” Andre Ravinowich, senior manager of product planning at Hyundai, told InsideEVs in an interview. “You see the need. You see the opportunity. It’s now available. Why wait?”
2025 Kia EV6
Hyundai’s brands have announced five vehicles so far that’ll come from the factory with an NACS port, with three making their debut last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Those are the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9, 2025 Kia EV6, 2026 Kia EV9 and 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. They’re not on the road quite yet, but will be in the coming months.
Also, from Hyundai's past statements and photos, we can presume that an updated Ioniq 6 sedan will also use the NACS plug: ""In the United States, all-new or refreshed Hyundai EVs will come exclusively with a NACS port, beginning in Q4 2024... Tesla’s commitment to expanding its network will enhance customer access to out-of-home charging and fully support the ultra-fast charging speeds on Hyundai’s advanced Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) vehicles, including Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and the upcoming EV models.""
Tesla sells five consumer models, all equipped with the NACS the company originated: the Model S, Model X, Model Y, Model 3 and Cybertruck. The Semi, a class-8 truck, uses a different plug. Tesla says the Cybercab, an autonomous taxi due out in 2026, won’t have a port at all. It’ll exclusively juice up through wireless, inductive charging.
With this move, the Hyundai Motor Group has beat basically the entire auto industry to the punch. While all major automakers have said they’d switch to Tesla’s plug design moving forward in exchange for access to Tesla’s vast Supercharger network, barely any have NACS-equipped models hitting roads imminently.
Historically, Superchargers were exclusively for Tesla owners, and other cars were incompatible with them from both a hardware and software perspective. Starting with Ford last year, various carmakers struck deals with Tesla to get their customers access—first through adapters, and later through NACS ports built natively into their vehicles.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 at Tesla Supercharger station in San Clemente, California
The company wanted to move quickly since access to EV charging is one of the biggest hurdles facing wider EV adoption, Kia and Hyundai officials told InsideEVs. By linking up with Tesla, owners of Hyundais and other participating brands will get access to an additional 17,000 EV charging stalls and counting.
“When it’s something that needs to be universally accessible, you’re not helping the public by having an A and a B and not allowing public access to both,” Steve Center, Kia America COO and Executive Vice President, told InsideEVs last week. “Which one should be the standard? Don’t know, don’t care. Right now there’s more of those chargers,” he said, referring to Tesla Superchargers.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Timing was also on the company’s side, the officials said. The Ioniq 9 is a brand-new model coming out next spring, while others were due for mid-cycle refreshes anyway. That presented the opportunity to switch up the charging port. In the EV6’s case, Kia also moved its charging port from the right rear to the left rear, mirroring Tesla’s setup for its cars. EVs with their ports in other places sometimes need to block multiple Supercharger stalls just to plug in, and Kia wanted to make Supercharging more convenient.
Meanwhile, other brands haven’t been as quick to roll out NACS-native cars. Ford refreshed the Mustang Mach-E crossover for the 2024 model year, so it missed the boat. General Motors launched several new EVs this year and has multiple coming soon from Cadillac, but we haven't seen any with a native NACS port out of the gate quite yet. Porsche just started delivering its electric Macan, which also uses the old standard. Those projects were all likely deep into development when all the Tesla deals kicked off.
Lucid Gravity with Tesla NACS charging port.
However, the Gravity, a three-row SUV from the EV startup Lucid Motors, will launch with a NACS port later this year.
HMG is all but certain to surpass Tesla in terms of NACS-equipped cars soon enough. Going forward, all of its new and refreshed EVs sold in the U.S. will come from the factory with NACS charging. So existing models like the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Genesis GV60, along with forthcoming ones like the Kia EV3, should join the party soon.

The Honda Prologue's $229-A-Month Lease Deal Comes To These States,https://insideevs.com/news/742202/prologue-cheap-lease-deal-national/,Honda's low-cost EV lease deal has expanded out from California. Get it while you can.,2024-11-25 16:00:00,"I don’t like every electric vehicle. In fact, I’m pretty sure the rest of the InsideEVs crew would be hard-pressed to put their finger on an electric that I would explicitly like. However, I am a very value-oriented person, and I know a good deal when I see one. I’m not the Honda Prologue’s best friend, but at $229 a month, I understand why so many people are signing on the line. That’s a really good deal.
And recently, Honda has expanded this really cheap EV lease deal once only found in California to more states.
According to a report from CarsDirect, Honda’s cheapest lease deal is $229 for 36 months with $1,299 due at signing. This price assumes the Prologue is $48,795, including a $1,000 bonus for current Honda (or competing brand) lessees. Miles are limited to 10,000 per year. This is a pretty crazy deal for a nearly-$50,000 car.
If you’re not eligible for the $1,000 cash for competing lessees, the price jumps to $259 per month. Still, that’s a pretty strong deal. For a long time, this special lease was only in California, but now it’s making its way across the U.S. and can be found in 17 different states, including, strangely, West Virginia.
By comparison, only a handful of other EVs can match the Prologue’s value. The similarly-sized VinFast VF8 may beat the Prologue’s price, but that crossover’s 264-mile range can’t touch the 291 miles of the Prologue. (And I'm going to go ahead and venture a guess that the VinFast won't give you the same level of dependability.) The Toyota BZ4X can be dirt cheap in some regions, but it’s real-world range and efficiency numbers are downright lousy.
On paper, the Prologue is one of the best deals in the business. It’s not hard to see why it’s been such a relatively hot seller for both Honda and EVs in general. Honda moved 12,644 during Q3, with only the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model Y outselling the Prologue.
However, even if you’re not in a state that is privy to the EV lease deal, like myself writing from Ohio, the Prologue’s lease is still cheap. In other the Prologue is being advertised for as little as $259 per month, with $2,999 due at signing, with the same mileage allotment as the $229 per-month lease found in other states.
We’ve only got about a month left in the year. Will Honda export its $229-per-month lease to other states? Here’s hoping it’ll happen before the EV tax credit is potentially phased out under a new Trump administration.

California May Do EV Rebates Under Trump—Just Not For Tesla,https://insideevs.com/news/742194/california-may-revive-ev-rebates-if-trump-kills-tax-credits/,California Governor Gavin Newsom has floated the idea of reviving the state's EV rebates and leaving Tesla out.,2024-11-25 14:28:31,"California has spearheaded the electric vehicle movement in the U.S. and it doesn't plan to slow down anytime soon. If President-elect Donald Trump repeals the consumer incentives in January, California may restart its EV rebate program, the state's Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed on Monday. But there's a twist: Tesla's EVs would reportedly be excluded from the revival of this rebate program.
EV buyers of all eligible brands nationwide can currently obtain up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, depending on their individual tax liabilities, making adoption easier on the wallet. That’s on top of local and state-level incentives encouraging buyers to go electric. But Trump has threatened to repeal the federal consumer incentives on ""day one,"" falsely calling them a ""mandate"" and repeatedly attacking EVs on the campaign trail. He only recently warmed up to EVs after Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated about $200 million to his campaign effort. Musk and Trump both support ending the tax credits.
But now California's governor says the state won't budge. “Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong—zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California,"" he added. ""We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future—we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.”
Yet his office told Bloomberg today that Tesla will be excluded from this new proposal to allow rivals to catch up. The rebates would come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, wherein industrial polluters can purchase emissions allowances, which the government then uses to support climate programs across industries, including transportation. “It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,” the governor's office said in an email.
The state has sold over two million zero-emission vehicles so far. Its Clean Vehicle Rebate Program helped drive this adoption, but the program ended in Nov. 2023. Throughout its life, CRVP funded 594,000 vehicles, displaced 456 million gallons of gas and helped save nearly 4 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, according to the California Air Resources Board. Transportation emissions are public health hazards directly linked to respiratory illnesses and lung diseases.
Newsom has proposed to create a new version of CRVP to continue driving EV adoption to tackle climate change. Yet exclusion from a potential rebate scheme would be a blow for Tesla sales in the region. It's one of Tesla's sales strongholds—and the birthplace of its success. However, Musk and Governor Newsom's relationship soured after Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin. Newsom has also clashed with Trump on emissions regulations.
That said, Trump cannot single-handedly repeal the federal EV incentives. They are enshrined under law as part of the Biden administration's landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Any pullback would require congressional approval. Governor Newsom cannot revive the state's tax credit program unilaterally either. He requires approval from the state legislature. The state's budget is among the country's largest, but it has witnessed growing deficits since the pandemic, as per the California Legislative Analyst's Office.
California also wants to ban gas car sales by 2035 but has yet to receive federal approval. As many as 17 other states have either already adopted California's emissions standards or are finalizing similar regulations. However, Trump has threatened to strip California of its ability to set its own emissions standards, but he will likely face opposition. When he tried to do the same during his last term, the state sued his administration 120 times.

GM And Hyundai EV Pickup Could Be In Development,https://insideevs.com/news/742182/hyundai-gm-ev-pickup/,"The two global rivals are reportedly working together to build an EV pickup that could be sold under a ""badge engineering"" scheme.",2024-11-25 13:05:28,"General Motors and Hyundai have been hanging out quite a bit lately. And apparently, they like each other so much that they may team up on future technical collaborations. Given their shared interests in things like electric vehicles, hydrogen and robotaxis, that makes sense. But could it yield a jointly developed electric pickup truck?
Maybe so. News of the EV truck development comes from Korean business publication, Pulse, which cites a source familiar with the matter and builds on the signing of a memorandum of understanding that the two brands penned in mid-September.
The experiment is said to be in its infancy and fueled by an agreement drawn up by the automakers earlier this year—something which was said to potentially birth new technologies for future vehicles. But an entirely new EV platform, let alone EV pickup? Now there's something that nobody expected.
Now, nothing is set in stone just yet. The idea of a potential EV pickup partnership is still unconfirmed by the automakers. However, the biggest concern is whether the long-term relationship between the two companies can outlast GM's previous foray into EVs with Honda if a viable product actually comes to market.
According to Pulse, Hyundai's executive chairman Euisun Chung met with GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month to discuss the project's specific details. The outcome of that meeting? Apparently the world could be getting an EV pickup out of the deal.
The development of the truck is said to fall within the scope the MOU, which was to ""investigate joint product development, manufacturing and future clean energy technologies""—all of which one company official said that progress has been made on.
Here's the latest on the progress, per Pulse:
“During the latest meeting, the two leaders reviewed the progress made since the MOU was signed,” a company official said.
“We are exploring various areas for bilateral collaboration, ranging from vehicle development to future energy solutions.”
The final product will likely be the product of “badge engineering,"" which essentially means that the truck could be produced by GM and wear a Hyundai badge, or built by Hyundai and cosplaying as one of GM's brands.
Sorry to say, but it looks like the vehicle won't be destined for U.S. roads—at least not as planned. The truck is reportedly being developed for the Latin American market GM Authority points out that this means the game of badge engineering could mean that GM is looking to replace the Chevy D-Max or S10 Max, which are rebadged versions of the Isuzu D-Max and Maxus T70, respectively.
On paper, the partnership seems like a win-win. Hyundai gets the expertise of General Motors, which has decades of truck building in the world's largest consumer pickup market, and GM to tap into Hyundai's manufacturing efficiency and global reach.
The real test will be whether this truck can move past the boardroom and into a factory. These types of partnerships always seem like a great idea, but the execution can be hit or miss—just look at what played out GM and Honda's EV partnership after the release of the Prologue. But if the brands can pull this off, it's a good sign for everyone involved. And, hey, who knows, maybe something stemming from the deal will eventually make it to the U.S. market down the road.

The Battery Crisis Taking Europe's EV Sector By Storm,https://insideevs.com/news/742158/cm-northvolt-tesla-mercedes/,"Plus, Mercedes looks to cut costs and Tesla is driven by ""animal spirits.""",2024-11-25 09:56:39,"I feel like a broken record at this point, but the electric vehicle race isn't just about cars. It's about who controls the battery supply chain, and thus one of the most crucial energy technologies of tomorrow. As is the case in the U.S., Europe is trying to break free of China's iron grip on the battery space. But the failure of a once-promising battery project has cast doubt on that, and sent ripple effects across the entire auto industry.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Also on deck today: Mercedes-Benz is looking to cut costs and Tesla's stock is surging on what British economist John Maynard Keynes today would've called ""vibes."" Let's dig in.
Northvolt Sodium-Ion Battery
I am, of course, talking about Northvolt, the Swedish-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer that just declared bankruptcy in U.S. court. Everyone had high hopes for Northvolt. BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen and other firms were not only counting on Northvolt for future batteries but were also investors in the company. As The Information noted as well, the governments Germany and Canada put billions into it as well in hopes of future factories.
Basically, Northvolt got a ton of hype, funding and excitement for the future just a few years ago. So what the heck happened? The same issues that have befallen many battery operations: high costs, delays and multiple challenges ramping things up at scale.
As Bloomberg reported this weekend, the biggest cracks appeared when BMW canceled a $2 billion contract this summer when Northvolt revealed it wouldn't be able to get i4 and iX batteries up to scale before 2026—not only three years late, but late enough to where those models will be phased out in favor of newer ones like the Neue Klasse EVs. Things tumbled from there: ""The scale of the delays, and how bad things were with building budgets and construction projects remained hidden, the investor said, recounting how excel models and slide decks were used to conceal how empty the coffers had become,"" the story says. Ouch.
Here's former Aston Martin and Nissan exec Andy Palmer weighing in for Reuters:
Northvolt has missed some in-house targets and curtailed production at its battery cells plant in northern Sweden, underscoring the difficulties, Reuters reported last Monday. ""The biggest issue is that batteries are not easy to make and Northvolt haven’t satisfied the supply demands of their customers - that is a management issue,"" said Andy Palmer, founder of consultancy Palmer Automotive said.
“The Chinese are technologically 10 years ahead of the West in batteries. That’s a fact,"" he said.
Already, Volkswagen is taking a big financial hit from Northvolt's failure, but Volvo—owned by China's Geely Group—seems to be messing around the least here. It's moving to take control of Northvolt's stake in another joint venture. But Volkswagen is already having a terrible year, as is the rest of the European auto sector amid declining new car demand, rising labor costs and intense competition from China.
Yet analysts believe that if Europe backs off in the battery race now, it risks being even more behind China than it already is. But it may be tough to convince investors of that as the EV transition feels rockier than it has years.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
I was heartened to see that after some early EV setbacks, Mercedes-Benz is hardly giving up in the space. The new CLA-Class seems like a high-tech powerhouse that may just rival some of what we see coming out of China these days.
But Mercedes has hardly been immune to the same headwinds above. As such, it's looking to cut costs, focus on ""profitability over volume,"" invest more into internal combustion and reevaluate situations like a factory in Mexico that only makes the GLB crossover. From Automotive News:
In September, Mercedes cut its financial forecast for the year as the entire German auto industry, from BMW to Volkswagen, struggles to stay competitive amid higher energy costs, inflation and an expensive transition to EVs.
For Mercedes, weaker sales of top-tier models such as the S-Class in China, inventory clearance of electric vehicles, and costly model transitions, such as the G-Class update, were all factors leading to the weak Q3 results. Mercedes is also taking a closer look at where it is investing after it decided to build and sell combustion cars for longer than it had planned because of slow EV demand.
Wilhelm said investment decisions will focus on ensuring that customers have a choice between EVs and efficient combustion models across all segments.
With China not being the cash cow it once was, firms like Mercedes need to figure out another way forward.
Meanwhile in America right now, Tesla's stock price has been surging, up 50% year-over-year and at its highest levels since 2022. But one analyst insists it's not because of business fundamentals—it's more on the promise that CEO Elon Musk can Deliver Things® now that he's apparently become a key figure in the incoming Trump White House.
""Animal spirits,"" this analyst calls it, citing a Keynesian term that describes psychological factors like overall investor confidence. Or ""vibes,"" as we'd say today. From Bloomberg:
While policy proposals have emerged since President-elect Donald Trump’s victory that could favor Tesla, analysts led by Joseph Spak wrote that the changes wouldn’t be absolute positives for the company.
Removing consumer tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, for example, could force Tesla to have to cut prices, Spak wrote. He also noted that while the regulatory environment under Trump may be more conducive to artificial intelligence ventures, including autonomous vehicles, Tesla doesn’t have a robotaxi ready to take advantage of relaxed rules.
“The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum,” Spak wrote in the report.
Don't say that I didn't warn you.
Mercedes CLA MMA Platform
We've had several stories lately on Mercedes' future tech push and more are coming. And the German automaker seems to be taking a diversified approach to powertrains and electrification, which is smart given the current environment. What else do you want to see out of Benz as it figures out the future?

‘Terrible’: Rivian’s Longest-Range EV Tested For Its Road-Tripping Abilities,https://insideevs.com/news/742161/rivian-r1t-road-trip-charging-test/,The refreshed Rivian R1T with the Max Pack battery has an EPA rating of 420 miles on a full charge.,2024-11-25 09:00:39,"Rivian’s refreshed EVs, the R1S and R1T, have dozens of meaningful improvements under the skin. There’s a heat pump, which improves efficiency, and several other tweaks that are meant to make the car easier to manufacture and ultimately cheaper for the end user, including a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for the entry-level version.
The other battery pack versions are also different from the pre-facelift vehicles, and they should be better in every way–that’s to be expected from a refresh. However, as our friend Kyle Conner from Out of Spec Reviews found out, that’s not necessarily the case.
He drove a brand-new, 2025 Rivian R1T with the Dual Motor drivetrain and the Max battery pack to find out how good of a road-tripping vehicle it is. And as it turns out, it could have been better.
More Stuff Like This
With an EPA-rated range of 420 miles and a usable battery capacity of 141.5 kilowatt-hours, the EV was driven down to a 10% state of charge en route to a Tesla Supercharger that’s open to all electric vehicles. During the trip to the Supercharger, the battery was preconditioned and was ready to take in the maximum amount of kilowatts available for a 400-volt battery like the one in the R1T–250 kilowatts.
After plugging in the DC fast charger, the electric pickup refused to go over 173 kW, even though the battery was preconditioned and there was no thermal limitation on the charger side. The charging session was stopped after exactly 15 minutes, and the state of charge level went up to 36%. In total, the R1T had taken in 43 kWh of energy during the 15-minute stint.
Then, Conner hit the road at a constant speed of 82 miles per hour on the highway. The problem was that the adaptive cruise control wouldn’t work, so he had to use the accelerator pedal to keep the speed constant, like in the old days.
During the whole test, the climate control was running on Auto and the air suspension was manually set to the lowest level to improve efficiency. After just 75 miles on the highway, the R1T’s state of charge was back at 10% and the efficiency was 1.93 miles/kWh. In other words, not a great road-tripping machine, mainly because of the unimpressive charging performance.
“What an absolutely dreadful charging performance,” Conner said after unplugging the electric pickup from the Supercharger. All the elements needed for a great charging session were there, but the EV refused to accept more power from the stall. In the real world, this means owners will have to spend more time for each charging stop during long trips.
“The Rivian is still one of the best vehicles on the market today,” Conner added, referring to the R1T’s off-roading abilities, good ride and overall driving experience. It’s in the charging department where more work needs to be done, he said.
The 2025 Rivian R1T with the Max battery pack, which uses nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells, starts at $83,900. It’s the longest-range EV in Rivian’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the entry-level R1T with the Standard battery–which uses LFP cells–starts at $69,900 and has an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles.
By comparison, a 2025 Rivian R1S–that’s the SUV, not the pickup–with the base LFP battery fared better in Out of Spec’s 10% road-tripping challenge. It maxed out at 218 kW instead of 173 kW, added 46.2 kWh of energy in 15 minutes instead of 43 kWh and drove for 91 miles instead of 82 miles before hitting a 10% state of charge again.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Superchargers Are Getting Longer Cables,https://insideevs.com/news/742106/tesla-supercharger-longer-cables-non-tesla-evs/,Tesla also has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve to prevent non-Tesla EVs from taking up two spots when charging.,2024-11-25 03:37:34,"The Tesla Supercharger network is getting some improvements to cater to the growing number of non-Tesla EVs that can top up their batteries at the NACS-equipped DC fast chargers.
As a quick reminder, the Supercharger network was originally designed exclusively for Tesla EVs. All Tesla EVs have their charging port on the rear-left side of the vehicle, so the charging cables are just the right length to reach the plug. Some non-Tesla EVs, however, have the inlet on the rear-right or front-left, which is a problem because their owners are forced to take up two charging spots by parking next to the stall they’re actually using.
This frowned-upon but necessary move is a growing problem as more non-Tesla EVs are getting access to the Supercharger network, either because they’re getting Tesla’s NACS charging connector from the factory or through a charging adapter. However, it might soon be a thing of the past.
More EV Charging Stories
In short, Tesla is ramping up the installation of its V4 Supercharger stalls which have longer cables–long enough to cater to all port locations. In an X post, the company said there will be more Superchargers with long cables than stalls with short cables.
Max de Zegher, Tesla's head of North American Charging, added that the Supercharger algorithm now updates the availability status for nearby chargers every 15 seconds.
Furthermore, the AI and robotics company which just happens to be the maker of the most successful EVs on the market, has improved its stall availability algorithm to stop “overpromising” the number of open stalls. Tesla said it now knows when an EV with a charging port located somewhere other than the rear-left has plugged into a Supercharger. As a result, the algorithm will automatically slash the number of available stalls shown on the map because the driver of that EV has probably blocked two spots.
Another change has to do with the charging sites themselves. Tesla said it has modified over 1,500 locations so that drivers never have to use more than two charging spaces to top up their batteries. Together, all these improvements will make life a lot easier for both Tesla and non-Tesla EV drivers.",Iulian Dnistran
2025 Audi RS E-Tron GT Gets A Lot More Powerful—And Expensive,https://insideevs.com/news/742087/audi-e-tron-gt-refresh/,It becomes the quickest-accelerating production Audi ever made.,2024-11-24 14:55:44,"Audi has infused its sportiest EV, the E-Tron GT sedan, with similar upgrades to its sister model, the revised 2025 Porsche Taycan, making it the most powerful Audi ever. The power boost is so significant that the base model 2025 E-Tron GT now gets more power in base trim than the outgoing range-topping RS E-Tron GT. All power variants also have a larger battery pack that boosts range.
The E-Tron GT lineup in the U.S. is now comprised of the entry-level S model, which costs $125,500 or $19,000 than before plus an additional $1,295 destination fee. It has a lot more power, though: 637 horsepower versus 523 hp, and its acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph drops by 0.6 seconds to 3.3 seconds.
The top RS E-Tron GT is only available as the 912 hp Performance model in the U.S., with a sprint time of only 2.4 seconds. This makes the most powerful and quickest-accelerating production Audi ever. Pricing starts at $167,000, or almost $20,000 more than the old RS, but the nearly 300 hp power boost and many other upgrades do justify it to a degree.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
Total battery capacity for both variants has gone up from the previous 93.4 kilowatt-hours to 105 kWh (97 kWh usable), increasing the EPA range to 300 miles for both when equipped with the standard 20-inch wheels. That’s up considerably from before when these cars were rated at no more than 249 miles.
Most of these upgrades mirror what Porsche did with the refreshed Taycan, including the lightened rear motor, whose weight has been cut by 22 pounds. Audi also upgraded the front motor to allow it to discharge 600 amps instead of the 300 it mustered before, bringing it in line with the rear motor.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
The RS variant gets a boost button that temporarily adds 94 more horsepower switching to the same motor map as during launch control. This lasts 10 seconds, and you see a countdown on the driver’s display every time you push the button.
Charging is also quicker thanks to a 50 kW power increase, bringing the car’s peak charging power to 320 kW thanks to its 800-volt platform. This makes the 10 to 80% fast charge happen in 18 minutes “under ideal conditions,” according to Audi.
2025 Audi E-Tron GT
So while both the E-Tron GT and the Porsche Taycan have the same basic platform, the latter is more engaging and fun to drive. Audi says it has made the 2025 E-Tron GT better to drive, tweaking its steering to feel more direct. There’s also a new air suspension setup, which is said to improve comfort without sacrificing sportiness. Installing the new suspension apparently required a special qualification for the factory workers who assemble the car.
Will these upgrades drum up more interest in Audi's electric sport sedan? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Tesla Sued This Startup. Getting It To Drop The Case Was ‘A Guessing Game’,https://insideevs.com/news/741987/tesla-evject-escape-connector-lawsuit-dropped/,"EVject makes a charging connector that allows EV owners to drive away while charging, potentially avoiding a dangerous situation.",2024-11-24 14:00:09,"Imagine the following scenario. It’s late evening, and you’re waiting for your EV to charge at a public DC charging station. You’re inside the vehicle and you see someone approaching. What do you do?
Maybe it’s nothing, but you’d rather drive away, just for peace of mind. Here’s the kicker, though: first, you need to unplug the charging cable. Do you have enough time? Will the person approaching you pick up the pace once he sees you are getting out of the car?
It’s a gut-wrenching experience and it’s why Utah-based EVject developed the Escape Connector. In short, it’s a sort of adapter that you hook up to the end of the charging cable and then plug in to recharge. If you need to drive away in an emergency, you just stop the charging session from the EV’s screen and then drive away. The connector is available for cars with a NACS, CCS1 or CCS2 plug.

EVject’s connector splits in half, leaving behind the charging cable and bringing some much-needed peace of mind. Once the charging session is stopped, there’s no electricity running through the charger’s cable or the piece left in the charging port, so it’s completely safe.
Tesla, however, didn’t think so. It sued EVject earlier this year, claiming that the device was “unsafe.” Tesla subjected the Escape Connector to some stress testing and concluded that the temperature could exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit after 30 minutes.
According to EVject’s founder, Kreg Peeler, that testing session was deeply flawed and even Tesla’s equipment would have failed. “They didn't use any communication connections. All they did was wire the two hot pins, which means even if we had a thermal sensor, it would have kept charging,” Peeler told InsideEVs. “The only way any adapter, including Tesla adapters, knows when to turn off is if it stops the communication pins, or if it sends a different signal across communications. They didn't do any of that.”
Initially, Tesla sent a cease and desist letter to EVject, claiming that the Escape Connector and marketing materials surrounding it were infringing on Tesla’s trademark rights. EVject removed all Tesla references and everything else that could have had anything to do with trademark infringement, but then Tesla filed suit against EVject claiming the connector was unsafe.
The automaker eventually dropped the suit, but adapting the product to Tesla’s standard was “a guessing game,” according to EVject’s Kreg Peeler. The solution was to add a thermal sensor to the Escape Connector that automatically cuts off power if the surface temperature exceeds 140 degrees. But getting there was the tough part because Tesla didn’t simply say “Do this and you’ll be ok.” Instead, the maker of the Model 3 reacted when things were wrong, without offering the handbook for what needed to be done.
“Basically, they won't tell you what it needs to be, but they'll tell you when you missed,” Peeler said. “So that's kind of the way they play, and I think part of it is they're constantly changing, right? They're constantly adapting and pushing their own standards, and therefore they don't want to be on record quoting what the standard is because it might change next week. That’s my speculation, but that's what happens when you're really trying to change an entire industry.”
Peeler said he doesn’t hold any grudges against Tesla and reiterated several times during our interview that he and his company are Tesla fans. He just wishes things would have gone another way, with a little more constructive criticism and an easier collaboration.
One half of the EVject Escape Connector remains in the car's charging port and it can be easily removed after getting to safety.
The other half remains on the charging wand and it can also be removed without any risk of electric shock.
“We just wish they did things a little bit differently,” the startup’s founder said. “We don't like the fact that there is a big public notice saying that we were ‘unsafe’ because we just don't think that's the true statement.”
As for the roughly 3,500 people who ordered the device before the whole court case fiasco, they were offered free replacements with the updated version, but only 600 or so chose to go down this route. The remaining 2,900 kept their original connector was “fine.” Customers who need to use the connector in an emergency situation will get a free replacement. Owners can extract the half that stays in the charging port without any risk of being electrocuted, but the connector is fitted together with a special press at EVject's facility, so putting it back together by hand is impossible.
“We’ve never had one complaint from a customer,” Peeler said. “And they also recognize that the new device isn't going to change anything. We're not changing our materials. We're not changing the way it conducts electricity. Nothing about the device is changing, except if, frankly, Tesla overdrives their equipment, our device will turn off. That's it.”\",Iulian Dnistran
Used Buying Guide For Plug-In Hybrid Electric Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/741969/used-phev-plug-in-hybrid-buying-guide/,"A used PHEV can be tempting, especially with the potential eligibility for a federal tax credit.",2024-11-24 12:00:48,"Plug-in hybrids (aka PHEVs) have been around for a while now. That means the cutting-edge vehicles of a few years ago are now coming off leases and ending up on used car lots. A used PHEV can be tempting, especially with (at least for now) the potential eligibility for a federal tax credit. But the prospect may also cause more trepidation than a typical used car purchase.
PHEVs are more complicated than combustion cars — and have complications buyers aren’t familiar with. Some high-profile PHEVs have been subject to recalls and suffered reliability issues. Battery technology and the market are also evolving. So, we don’t know precisely how PHEVs will age and how much buyers will value them when they do.
As with any used car purchase, prospective buyers must do their due diligence and answer some critical questions before proceeding.
More Buying Info
The first natural question when buying a plug-in hybrid: do you need one? A plug-in hybrid can seem like the “best of both worlds” on paper. But theory differs from practice.
The optimal environment for using a PHEV — short trips, convenient plug access — overlaps heavily with the optimal use case for an EV. Buyer fear or being unable to buy the type of car desired (a used three-row family minivan, for instance) as an EV may be the reason to go PHEV.
Alternatively, if a buyer has a legitimate concern that would preclude an EV — lengthy roundtrip commutes or long road trips — a conventional hybrid would likely deliver as good if not better efficiency, cost less up front and be less of a nuisance.
PHEVs can make a lot of sense and be very efficient — when you can charge them regularly with regular plug access. Helpfully, buyers don’t need to install a Level 2 charger. Many PHEV batteries can be charged overnight on a standard 110V wall outlet. Ideally, the manufacturer-provided charging cable is in working order. If not, buyers can typically purchase a third-party portable charging cable for between $100 and $200.
More Tax Credit Info
For now, a used plug-in hybrid can still be eligible for a federal clean vehicle tax credit worth up to $4,000. The vehicle and the buyer must meet certain thresholds to qualify.
The vehicle must be sold from a dealer, be priced at or below $25,000 and must be at least two years out from the calendar year in which it is bought (in 2024, it would have to be the 2022 model year or older). The PHEV’s battery pack must have a capacity of at least 7 kWh and a GVWR under 14,000 pounds.
The federal tax credit is income-limited for the buyer. A buyer may not have earned more than $150,000 as a joint filer, $112,500 as a head of household or $75,000 as an individual.
Chevrolet Volt battery pack rendered
Replacing a battery on a plug-in hybrid is a rare occurrence. The failure rate on PHEV batteries in vehicles built in 2016 and later — not counting recalled vehicles — is “well under one percent.” But if you need to replace the PHEV battery, it’s a repair that can cost several thousand dollars. And it’s something you’d ideally want to do under warranty.
PHEVs typically have bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties similar to those of combustion vehicles. But many newer ones also have battery warranties stretching to 100,000 or even 150,000 miles. A battery warranty is great for peace of mind when buying a used PHEV. It should also help protect resale value on the back end if the buyer doesn’t keep the vehicle past that 100,000-mile mark.
All batteries degrade over time. But degradation should not be too much of a concern when buying a used plug-in hybrid — at least a recent vintage one. Vehicle batteries are lasting longer than manufacturers initially feared. Rates of degradation depend on the individual vehicle and aren’t always linear. But broadly, a PHEV battery should stay in the usable range (at least 70-80% of its initial capacity) past 100,000 miles.
PHEV batteries, in particular, are designed to be resilient. Most PHEV batteries have a lot of unused capacity. That lets the PHEV battery, constantly being filled to 100 and drained to 0, stay within a happy operating range and place less stress on the battery.
Range loss also matters less for PHEVs than EVs. Let’s presume a battery experiences a 10 percent range loss. An EV offering 225 miles of range instead of its initial 250 miles is a bigger deal than a 27-mile range PHEV offering 24 miles before the gas engine kicks in.
Testing degradation yourself will be tricky; most dealers won’t let you borrow the car, drain the battery with simulated daily usage, and compare it to expected results. The dealership should be able to provide a battery health test to determine the state of the vehicle’s battery. Failure to do that should raise suspicion. So should a posted range figure on a full charge that looks far less than what it should be.
Like full EVs, plug-in hybrids can lose all-electric range in extremely cold weather. Like in EVs, the main culprit is heating the cabin, which is hard to do efficiently. Heat pumps allow a vehicle to warm the cabin more efficiently. But that technology is relatively new for full EVs, let alone PHEVs.
Some PHEVs use an electric heater, which saps power and, consequently, range from the battery. Other PHEVs don’t have an electric component for heating and run the gasoline engine when needed to heat the vehicle. Either way, you can lose much of the efficiency you typically would gain driving a PHEV, especially an older PHEV with less than 20 miles of range.
Service history is essential when buying any new car. A plug-in hybrid can be the worst of both worlds from a service perspective. You have intricate and expensive battery packs and electric motors like an EV. But unlike an EV, you also have all the moving parts and traditional maintenance required for a combustion vehicle.
Ensure the seller has detailed, up-to-date service records and that necessary services have been performed. Like EVs, PHEVs can be harder on their tires than combustion vehicles with the additional weight. Ensure the tires are in good condition and formulated to handle the extra burden from the plug-in hybrid.
2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV interior
All cars are de facto tech products now. Many modern reliability issues are going to be software-related rather than mechanical. You want to ensure that a used PHEV has installed all of its software updates and that the interface works correctly.
A newer infotainment system — less likely to be outmoded and more likely to be supported with updates — is better than an older one. The capability to do over-the-air software updates without a trip to the dealer is also helpful.
A plug-in hybrid should not scare used car buyers off in a vacuum. Yes, a PHEV will lose efficiency and performance as it ages. But so do combustion vehicles. The expected lifespan for the battery is not that far off most combustion engines. With due diligence, buyers can be confident about what they are buying. The ultimate question with a used PHEV is not so much whether buying one is prudent but whether a PHEV is the vehicle you need.
If a buyer does opt for a used PHEV, the best strategy is to find the newest vehicle with the least wear and tear available within the budget. PHEV tech has become more capable and more resilient in recent years. A longer remaining lifespan means greater value, whether that means a longer ownership tenure or better back-end resale value.",Ty Duffy
Battery Replacement Costs Are Poised To Plunge: 'Cheaper Than Fixing An Engine',https://insideevs.com/news/742022/battery-replacement-costs-fall-cheaper-than-fixing-engine/,A new report highlights the outsize effect of falling lithium prices on used EVs and second-life batteries.,2024-11-24 10:00:05,"The high-voltage battery is the lifeblood of an electric vehicle. However, concerns about the long-term health of an EV battery and the potential high cost of replacing it, especially on a used model, may deter many buyers from going electric. However, a silent revolution is underway in the world of battery manufacturing. That revolution is focused on increasing the energy density of batteries and improving their durability, all of which is poised to impact their replacement costs and second-life values, as per a new report from battery health and data start-up Recurrent.
Battery replacements are rare. Automakers generally offer a warranty of eight years or 100,000 miles on the pack. Most modern batteries can last twice as long and go double the distance, according to Recurrent. And that's a conservative estimate. Tesla owners frequently report driving over 200,000 miles in their EVs, that too with minimal degradation. There’s even a 1.2 million-mile Model S out there that has undergone four battery replacements—bringing the average replacement mileage to a whopping 300,000 miles.
Most of us won’t go to such extremes. But in the rare case that you do require a replacement for whatever reason, how much will it cost in the future? Assuming the industry continues to proliferate at the same pace, Recurrent has an answer: astonishingly low!
Citing data from climate research firm RMI, Recurrent estimates that cell prices could reach $35 per kWh by the end of the decade. This would translate to pack prices of $50 per kWh, bringing the replacement cost of a 100 kWh battery to $4,500–$5,000, or about $3,375 for a 75 kWh pack. These estimates put EV battery replacement costs on par with replacing an internal combustion engine. J.D. Power says engine replacement can cost between $4,000 for a four-cylinder unit and more than $10,000 for a high-performance one. How those prices evolve down the line remains to be seen.
As of today, replacing an EV battery can cost anywhere between $5,000 to $16,000, depending on the size of the pack and the vehicle's make and model. In most cases, you never even have to think about this for new cars. It's okay for most used EVs too, but experts recommend checking the health of a used pack before putting your money down.
Recurrent further said that owners may be able to offset battery replacement costs by reselling their used packs. As of today, a service shop usually keeps the used pack if it's replaced. It will then be refurbished or sold to another company to repurpose it for energy storage, backup power, or other uses. However, industry experts expect the used EV market to grow substantially down the line, with millions of used EV owners who may be able to negotiate the sale of their own packs if replacement is required. Recurrent projects this will offset the price of a new pack by a further $10-20 per kWh, depending on the size, chemistry and health.
Naturally, all this circles back to the bigger picture: lithium prices are falling rapidly and EVs are poised to reach price parity with gas cars. Goldman Sachs said in October that lithium prices are on track to plummet from $149 per kilowatt hour in 2023 to just $80 per kWh in 2026. This 50% drop would help BEVs reach ownership cost parity with gas cars in the U.S. within the next couple of years, that too “on an unsubsidized basis.” But Goldman expects the EV landscape next year to largely depend on how the regulatory environment takes shape under the Trump administration.
But that won’t deter long-term adoption. “We think we’re going to see a strong comeback in demand in 2026 purely from an economics perspective. We believe 2026 is when a consumer-led adoption phase will largely begin,” the report concludes.
All this is to say that the rare scenario of you requiring to replace your battery pack doesn't spell doom for the whole EV ownership experience. The lifespan of a modern battery is already great and seems on track to improve further. If replacement is required, experts say it may not cost as much as it does today in the future. And even then, there are clear ways to offset those replacement costs, as degraded packs may find multiple use cases in their second life.

It's Happening: Chrysler Confirms A Pacifica EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/741995/chrysler-pacifica-ev-coming-soon/,Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell revealed plans for the battery-powered minivan at the 2024 LA Auto Show.,2024-12-25 01:26:28,"Right now, Chrysler's only offering to the motoring world is the Pacifica minivan. Technically, the Voyager was resurrected for 2025, but that's really just a Pacifica with fewer options and a lower price tag. Now, we learn another Pacifica variant is coming, this time as a full-on EV.
That's what Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell told Green Car Reports at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show. Design details or a specific debut timeframe weren't mentioned. Chrysler did not immediately respond to comment when reached by Motor1 for confirmation and additional information.
In the report, Feuell alludes to the Halcyon concept as influencing the Pacifica EV. Debuting in February 2024, the Halcyon is actually a sleek, sizable sedan riding on the STLA Large platform. It followed the Chrysler Airflow concept, a sharp electric crossover from 2022 that had a production-ready vibe. The automaker's decision to essentially abandon plans for producion in 2023 came as a surprise, but Feuell reportedly wanted something more modern to take the company into the future.
Chrysler Halcyon Concept
Chrysler Airflow Concept
This whole situation is not without some irony. The Airflow concept utilized the same platform as the Pacifica, which will eventually have an electric version with Halcyon-influenced styling. Meanwhile, Chrysler is supposed to debut its first EV next year— a crossover likely using the STLA Large platform with Airflow influence. Interesting.
We have many questions at this point, including whether Chrysler is still on schedule for its first EV in 2025. Delays have affected other electric ambitions from brands within Stellantis, and we've heard precious little from Chrysler since the Halcyon's debut in February. The current Pacifica should get a significant update for 2026, which likely places a Pacifica EV debuting in late 2026 or 2027.
Of course, this all depends on Stellantis not killing Chrysler before then. The conglomerate's serious financial crisis prompted warnings from CEO Carlos Tavares that underperforming brands could be cut in as little as two or three years.

"Volkswagen ID. Buzz Dealer Markups Are Here, Even Though VW Said 'Don't'",https://insideevs.com/news/741991/vw-id-buzz-markups-are-here/,"VW ""strongly discouraged"" dealers from marking up the ID Buzz—they're doing it anyway.",2024-11-23 12:00:12,"I'm shocked. Shocked, I tell you. Shocked to learn that dealers are ignoring Volkswagen's now-former CEO's strongly-worded caution for dealerships not to add additional dealer markup the already expensive ID Buzz.
Okay, well, maybe not that shocked. But it's happening—dealerships are doubling down on Volkswagen's egregiously-priced electric people hauler by adding markups as high as $15,000, effectively locking out consumers who were already stretched thin on their budget following the German automaker's surprisingly high price announcement earlier this year.
Recent news popped up when a Redditor reached out to Herman Cook Volkswagen in Encinitas, California. The salesperson reportedly told the potential customer to expect a markup of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the ID Buzz—when the individual iterated VW corporate's instructions not to markup the Buzz, the salesperson thanked the would-be customer for their time and ended the conversation. InsideEVs reached out to the dealership and was told that the dealer had not yet decided on a markup but it would likely be between $10,000 and $15,000.
As it turns out, that seems to be the norm.
Another Redditor posted a screenshot of an email reportedly with Castle Volkswagen of Downers Grove, Illinois. The salesperson said that ""due to demand,"" the dealership would be asking ""around $10k over MSRP."" The dealership confirmed to InsideEVs that it would ""follow the market"" and seek between $5,000 and $10,000 over sticker.
""Price [gouging] at its best,"" wrote the Redditor. ""This dealership shouldn’t be allowed to operate.""
Another two posters cited additional dealership experiences in the $10,000 ADM range. And another in Oakland, California citing a $15,000 markup just to have the opportunity ""to be one of the first people with a Buzz."" Another with an additional $8,000 on top—which put the vehicle within just $3,000 of a Porsche Macan. Of course, some were more reasonable, with a markup of just around $4,000, but that's still a far cry from the markup-free experience that the public assumed it would have with the launch of the Buzz.
The ID Buzz looked to be one of the most exciting Volkswagens in years. A halo product meant to invoke BMW levels of emotion in owners—a feel-good family mobile with a nod to the 70s that tugged on the heartstrings of just about anybody who ever fantasized about owning a modern VW bus. I mean, folks were actually excited about owning one of these things which speaks volumes for vee-dub in modern times.
Then came the official debut with full specs and a price tag. Let's just say that reception was less-than-stellar. In fact, it might not be far off as to say that Volkswagen shot itself in the foot with the launch, because the internet was straight-up pissed.
First was the price. Would-be buyers expected the Buzz to be priced somewhere around other minivans—you know, in the $40,000-ish range. But, of course, this is a BEV we're talking about, so price parity isn't going to happen. But look at the Kia EV9—Kia managed to throw enough incentives at the family SUV to get it into the mid-$40,000s, so surely VW would do something similar?
Nope. The lowest-trimmed single motor Buzz starts at $59,995 before the $1,550 destination fees, all the way up to $69,995 for its Buzz Pro S with dual motors, an iconic dual-tone paint job, and a myriad of tech-first features. That pricing put the ID Buzz out of reach of many would-be buyers, and its abysmal 231 miles of range was enough to shock many others.
Here's the problem: these aren't just grumpy customers taking out inflation-induced infuriation on VW—this is a headache that Volkswagen can't afford right now.
VW is hurting big time. Its CFO articulated that the brand has ""maybe two"" years to get it together or else succumb to the mounting pressure that is global EV brands who can do things cheaper and more focused. Its ID family of vehicles has been underperforming expectations and feeling the squeeze from Tesla, Ford, Hyundai, and others. The ID Buzz was supposed to inject some new life into VW's lineup and excite buyers. Maybe even give them a reason to try out other ID cars.
Before it even announced the price, Volkswagen knew it couldn't afford markups on the Buzz. That alone should have been a key indicator that the automaker expected a high price on the model.
“We cannot make a mistake [with the ID Buzz]. With respect to the customer, let’s discuss it. We have a good relationship with the [dealer] network,” said former CEO of VW North America, Pablo Di Si, who was recently ousted from his position after just two years. “We cannot have markups.”
So here we are, in EV purgatory with the ID Buzz. It is too expensive for what it offers, too beloved to be ignored, and increasingly vulnerable to dealer markups. If Volkswagen does nothing, it can kiss new sales of its flagship product goodbye. And if it tries to punish dealers, then it needs to use its teeth instead of just empty words.

Tesla Model 3 Performance VS. BMW M3: 'It's Staggering',https://insideevs.com/news/741921/tesla-model-3-performance-vs-bmw-m3-competition/,"The Model 3 Performance has come a long way since its inception and has a lot going for it, including its price.",2024-11-23 10:00:13,"The BMW M3 is widely regarded as the benchmark in the sports sedan market. And no, your eyes are not deceiving you. Despite this being a website that specializes in writing about battery-powered cars, we need to recognize that BMW has mastered the art of producing a thrilling gas-powered four-door sedan that you can comfortably drive every day and take to the track now and then.
But here’s where the new Tesla Model 3 Performance comes into play. With new tech under the skin, such as better brakes and a fancy suspension, Tesla’s sportiest EV takes things up a notch and promises to be the best all-rounder, period. But is it so? Until we can get our hands on both a BMW M3 Performance xDrive and a Tesla Model 3 Performance, we’ll go by Jason Cammisa’s and Randy Pobst’s words, which were nicely laid out in the Hagerty video embedded below.
As a reminder, Camissa is a bona fide car journalist with two decades of experience reviewing cars, while Pobst is a multiple SCCA World Challenge GT champion.
More Stuff Like This
One of the biggest issues with the previous Model 3 Performance models was their inability to run multiple track laps at full speed without experiencing brake fade or some sort of powertrain limitation due to overheating. Now, though, it looks like Tesla dialed everything just right, with no brake fade after several hot laps in the Track Endurance mode. That said, the Endurance mode limits the EV’s top speed to preserve longevity, and it shows in the lap times.
After 15 minutes of continuous driving, the BMW M3 Competition was over 5,000 feet ahead of the Tesla Model 3 Performance, so there’s still work to be done. In a single-lap shootout, the M3 was also quicker than the Model 3, but by less than two seconds, with the EV’s biggest drawback being its tires.
As a daily driver, though, the Model 3 Performance is a great sports-oriented car, not just EV. The infotainment is great, although it doesn’t have Apple CarPlay, and the charging experience is excellent. However, the fact that there are no steering column stalks makes the Model 3 “dangerous,” according to Cammisa.
At the end of the day, however, the biggest issue is the price. The 2025 BMW M3 Sedan with rear-wheel drive and 473 horsepower starts at $76,000. Upgrading to the M3 Competition with xDrive all-wheel drive and 523 hp ups the price to $85,000. Add some options and you’ll soon pass the $100,000 mark.
Meanwhile, the Tesla Model 3 Performance, with dual-motor all-wheel drive and 510 hp, starts at $54,990. But, unlike BMW, Tesla doesn’t really sell optional extras, so what you see is what you get.
Is the BMW worth the extra $20,000 to $50,000? It’s a tough question to answer. Camissa said one could buy a Tesla Model 3 Performance and a Mazda Miata for the same price as a single BMW M3, which things into perspective. What’s your take?",Iulian Dnistran
Japan’s Big Four + Toyota’s HySE Project Is A Badass Hydrogen-Powered UTV,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741431/japan-big-four-toyota-hyse-dakar-racer/,It’s set to dominate the 2025 Dakar Rally.,2024-12-25 01:26:29,"What do Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Honda, and Toyota have in common? Well, clearly, they’re all Japanese, and they’re among the biggest brands in their respective industries. They’re also paragons of reliability, with the Japanese Big Four’s bikes all known for being capable of surpassing six-digit odometers. And as for Toyota, well, its vehicles have proven to be pretty much indestructible.
And so when these five companies collaborated to pretty much define the future of mobility, you can bet that the world was watching and that they were gonna come up with something pretty damn huge.
Indeed, it seems that they did not disappoint, as the HySE project is gearing up to tackle the 2025 Dakar Rally head on. The collaborative project will participate in the Dakar Rally’s new Mission 1000 category which focuses on new mobility technology such as electric, hydrogen, and hybrid vehicles.
As for HySE, well, the vehicle in question is nothing short of badass, and could very well be a glimpse into the future not just of off-road racing, but of mobility as a whole. The badass off-road racer is a crossover between multiple worlds, the perfect exercise of how powers can come together to produce something so much bigger than anyone thought.
The HySE racer is powered by a modified Kawasaki 998cc engine.
Under the hood, the HySE project is powered by a 998cc inline-four engine powered by none other than hydrogen. This engine configuration is nothing new, in fact, the team is using a Kawasaki engine—presumably one from a ZX-10R—that’s been heavily modified to be powered by hydrogen.
On paper, the specs are nothing short of impressive, with 150 horsepower on tap and 200 Nm (around 148 pound-feet) of torque. The thing will power a bonkers off-road racing machine that sort of looks like an overgrown side-by-side. It boasts long-travel suspension with tons of articulation to handle big jumps and high-speed sections, as well as knobby all-terrain tires that’ll make munching mile after mile of desert trail a walk in the park for this thing.
Should this thing prove to be even more of a success than it already is, it just might pave the way for the future of engines. Heck, this might actually be the closest thing we have to securing the future of internal combustion. Forever.
Not to put pressure on Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and Toyota, but the future of internal combustion is literally in your hands.

"Mercedes Reinvents Brakes For EVs, Puts Them Inside The Drive Unit",https://insideevs.com/news/742005/mercedes-in-drive-ev-brakes/,The manufacturer says in-drive brakes could provide a lifetime braking solution for electric vehicles with multiple advantages.,2024-11-22 18:01:00,"The vast majority of cars have outboard brakes that are connected to their wheel hubs, and only a handful come with inboard brakes. Mercedes has taken things one step further and put the brakes inside the housing of an electric vehicle’s drive unit, and it’s touting multiple advantages, including never having to service the brakes for the lifetime of the car.
Electric vehicles can use their motors to slow down, not only saving their friction brakes from wear but also putting electricity into their battery pack. Various companies have proposed different types of brakes for EVs, from Continental’s ultra-thick mountain bike-like disks to the drum brakes that Volkswagen equips all vehicles built on its MEB platform, like the ID.4 or Audi Q4 E-Tron.
VW argues that even in its EVs with over 300 horsepower, drum brakes are sufficient for the rear. Most of the braking is done by the front brakes anyway, so going back to this older style of brakes (which is cheaper than disk brakes) is one way VW has adapted its vehicles for electric propulsion.
Mercedes has now taken this one step further with its in-drive brakes. However, it hasn’t simply taken a traditional disk or drum brake setup and put it inside the drive unit. It completely reimagined braking, and in the version of the system they showed us in Stuttgart last week, the disk is water-cooled and it doesn’t spin, and the brake pad is circular and it spins with the motor.
There is no traditional caliper either and scrubbing speed is achieved by pushing the circular brake pad onto the stationary disk. Mercedes says this system shouldn’t require service for the lifetime of the vehicle and all the brake dust it generates is kept inside the system in a compartment that doesn’t need to be emptied.
The upcoming Euro 7 (EU7) emissions standard doesn’t just look at tailpipe emissions. It also takes tire and brake particulate emissions from vehicles into account, so keeping brake dust from going into the environment will become more of a talking point in Europe once EU7 comes into force in 2026.
More Mercedes EV Stories
This seems like a big departure even from the inboard brakes that we already know. Mercedes argues there are plenty of advantages aside from the system being “virtually maintenance-free.” Since the disk is water-cooled, brake fade under heavy use shouldn’t be an issue. It also reduces unsprung weight, which improves handling.
Another advantage touted by the manufacturer is being able to equip vehicles with completely covered, aerodynamic wheels that will help lower vehicles’ drag coefficient. The system would also reduce braking noise, and owners wouldn’t be met with rust-covered brake disks after not driving their cars for a few days.
We didn’t think this was such a big issue, but Mercedes told us this specifically was something it got many complaints about. The Mercedes engineer who explained how this new braking system works said removing the caliper from the wheel will give designers even more freedom to create unique-looking wheels, but it will be hard to convince car enthusiasts that this is an advantage.",Andrei Nedelea
Mercedes Wants EV Battery Packs With Both NMC And LFP Cells,https://insideevs.com/news/741983/mercedes-lfp-nmc-cell-batteries/,This was made possible by an innovative new power converter that can be integrated into the battery pack at a cell level.,2024-11-22 18:01:00,"While the details surrounding the impressively efficient new electric CLA were the most important news we obtained while in Stuttgart last week, Mercedes-Benz also gave us a glimpse at what it’s cooking up for the future. Among the many innovations we were shown at the event called Mercedes Future Experience was a new type of power converter that allows for much more control over a battery pack than ever before.
Its programmable micro-converter can be wirelessly controlled and embedded into the battery pack and controlled wirelessly. This allows for control on an individual cell pair, allowing for much finer adjustment of the charge that goes into each one. For this system to work, the cells need to be connected in parallel, not in series, which unlocks new possibilities.
For instance, a vehicle with this system could balance the charge in its cells far better than today’s EVs. It could detect and isolate damaged cells without affecting the entire battery pack, and it would also allow for a much more accurate battery health check, which would easily be able to pinpoint problem cells and check their individual parameters.
This new type of micro-converter can also keep the total battery pack voltage constant regardless of the state of charge. It typically varies with the state of charge.
Mercedes explains that “research results show it is possible to provide a constant HV output of 800 volts, regardless of the state of charge and the state of health of the individual cells. The output voltage of this vehicle battery is no longer dependent on the number of cells connected in series. The number is determined purely by the desired performance and capacity class.”
If this makes it into production, it would also allow for much more modular battery packs than what we have in today’s EVs, resulting in more efficient use of space. It could help automakers cut costs by applying increased standardization and modularization when applied on a large scale.
More EV Battery Stories
During a round table talk with Mercedes’ Chief Technology Officer Markus Schäfer, we asked about the possibility of using multiple chemistries within the same battery pack, specifically both LFP and NMC cells. Schäfer told us “Yes, this is exactly the idea, to mix and match,” and he confirmed that the possibility of an LFP and NMC pack is in the cards. He did not say when we could see such a pack in a production car given that this innovation is still in the very early stages of testing.
LFP (short for lithium iron phosphate) batteries can better take regular fast charging all the way to 100%, exhibiting less degradation than NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) batteries. They also have better thermal stability and are more affordable. However, NMC batteries can store more current and are preferred for large-capacity battery packs that power long-range EVs. Having both in the same battery pack would have multiple advantages, taking advantage of both their strengths.",Andrei Nedelea
Over 40% Of Tesla's Profit Comes From Selling Regulatory Credits,https://insideevs.com/news/742024/tesla-regulatory-sales-profit/,"If a new administration delivers more lax environmental rules for automakers, one of Tesla's key profit-drivers could go away.",2024-11-22 17:00:18,"Elon Musk spent around $200 million to help elect President Donald Trump. It was a surprising pairing, as Trump has long criticized electric vehicles, the primary thing Musk's biggest company makes. Trump has promised to get rid of the federal clean vehicle incentive for consumers, which Musk says will ultimately help Tesla. But if Trump delivers on another promise—rolling back emissions standards for other automakers—it may hurt another key Tesla revenue stream.
Tesla earned $2.1 billion by selling regulatory credits to other automakers in the first three quarters of 2024, according to reporting from The New York Times based on the company's regulatory filings. That accounts for 43% of the automaker's—er... ""A.I. company's""—profit.
These credits have long been a big part of Tesla's business. U.S. and other government standards require automakers to hit fleet-wide emissions targets. Companies that are above those targets must buy credits to bring down their average. They buy credits from companies like Tesla, which only makes zero-emissions vehicles, and other brands that are more efficient than required by law. This incentivizes companies to beat their targets, as it opens up a valuable revenue stream, while still providing leeway for those that can't or don't want to sell more efficient vehicles.
The credit-selling business was even more crucial to Tesla earlier on. Back when other automakers were struggling to get their EV programs off the ground, and Tesla was losing money on most cars it made, profit from regulatory credits was a lifeline. Many have argued it would have never survived without them.
But in hitching his wagon to Trump's, Musk has gambled that Tesla no longer needs government incentives for consumer purchases, or for its EV and battery factories or to drive its regulatory credit business. Musk has long said that Tesla is not a car company, and that its future ambitions lie in autonomy and A.I. For those who like Tesla for the cars, however, the CEO's increasing focus on A.I. and politics is disconcerting. After all, Tesla is a company that primarily builds cars, and one that would not exist today without a series of manufacturing incentives, consumer incentives and regulatory schemes that all helped it cross ""the valley of death"" that dooms many start-ups.
Despite supposedly being in it for the altruistic purpose of transitioning the whole world to sustainable energy, it sure looks like Musk is trying to pull up the ladder behind him. That's not a great look. But when you haven't stepped off the ladder yourself, it could be quite dangerous, too.

Reuters was the first to report the news of the Hyundai recall, but InsideEVs has confirmed it affects some Kias, too.
The recall covers 145,234 Hyundai and Genesis EVs, along with 62,872 Kia EV6s. The covered vehicles have an issue with their Integrated Charging Control Units (ICCUs), which is responsible for charging the low-voltage 12-volt battery using power from the high-voltage system. The ICCU is a common failure point on Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs on the E-GMP platform, and if it fails it'll stop charging the 12-volt battery. The 12-volt going flat can lead to a loss of drive power, causing the car to suddenly lose power and speed. Here is the full list of affected vehicles:

Owners have reported losing power on the freeway, resulting in the car suddenly dropping far below highway speeds before stopping entirely.
""I was driving on the highway and a message appeared that said 'check electrical system.' The power in the car then completely bottomed out and I could not go above 25 mph,"" one 2024 Ioniq 5 AWD owner reported in a public comment to NHTSA.
NHTSA opened an investigation into the 2022 Ioniq 5 back in early summer 2023, over the same issue. A month later, the agency opened a similar probe over the issue in the 2022 Kia EV6. Many EV6s and Ioniq 5s were already recalled over this issue, but apparently the fix didn't work. So Hyundai, Kia and Genesis are recalling all previously affected vehicles, plus additional ones not subject to the earlier recall.
If you own one of the affected vehicles, your dealer will check your ICCU and its fuse, replacing both if necessary. The dealer will also update the ICCU's software. You will need this recall even if your vehicle was previously subject to the ICCU recall. As with all recalls, you will be notified directly, and the work will be performed free of charge.

Rivian CEO On Dealer Laws: 'As Close As You Can Get To Corruption',https://insideevs.com/news/741992/rivian-ceo-dealer-model/,RJ Scaringe says that dealers essentially paid for laws that protect their business.,2024-11-22 13:10:51,"Despite its recent partnership with the German auto giant, Rivian has no plans to use Volkswagen's sales network, according to CEO RJ Scaringe.

""Unfortunately, in the United States it's not an easy question. We have this horrific state-by-state level of rules that are as close as you can get to corruption,"" Scaringe told InsideEVs and other reporters during a roundtable.
""I think you essentially have, like, lots of dealers have paid for laws that make it really hard for us to interact directly with the consumer,"" he continued.
Many states have protections for car dealers codified into law. They broadly protect dealers from having to directly compete with manufacturers, but how those rules are interpreted and applied varies wildly. In Tesla's home state, Texas, the company cannot sell cars out of company stores. Instead, it must sell cars online, and can deliver them at ""service centers."" Rivian's space in Seattle is similar, as in Washington the company's representatives cannot talk about pricing or take orders.
These laws were—in most cases—designed to protect dealerships from their own manufacturers selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out the middle man and outcompeting them on cost. But they are now stifling brands that don't have dealerships to compete with. There's no AutoNation Rivian or Penkse Tesla losing business when these companies sell in Texas or Washington. There's no option at all if you, as a consumer, want to buy a Tesla and take delivery in Louisiana. So these laws are effectively protecting dealers of other brands from legitimate competition with new brands.

The states with the strongest laws protecting dealers tend to have extremely large and powerful car dealer lobbies, which wine, dine and donate to local politicians to make sure they have plenty of friends in state government. These friendly relationships tend to correlate with laws that make sure it is nearly impossible to buy a car without including a dealer in the transaction. It's not hard to see why Scaringe says this is essentially ""corruption."" They're spending vast sums lobbying and being rewarded with laws that restrict consumer choice and competition while protecting their profits.
Because the laws are different in every state, you have to grease a lot of wheels to get the train moving. There are still states where it is illegal to sell Rivians or Teslas directly. And there are many states where dealers plan to challenge Volkswagen's plan to launch Scout Motors with a direct-to-consumer model, a la Tesla. If even one challenge in a major market succeeds, it may mess up the whole plan. Because while it's hard enough to sell vehicles directly to consumers, it gets a lot harder if you also have franchises operating as official sales and service locations.
All of the issues Rivian faces with its direct-to-consumer push ""become exacerbated if we were to use a mixed model"" where they have directly owned and franchise service centers, Scaringe says. So it's likely not possible to use VW dealers for service, even if VW was cool for it. But the CEO is still clear-eyed that expanding service options needs to be a priority, and not just doing service where you sell cars.
""You don't need 5,000 retail locations in the United States to sell three or four million cars a year. Tesla's a good example. [Its] number of retail locations per sale is far, far lower than any of the incumbents. But you do need a lot of service infrastructure,"" he said.
The vehicle's ability to diagnose and report its own problems will help improve service efficiency, as will Rivian's ability to do most service in your driveway. Over half of the company's current service visits are handled by its mobile service arm. But the fact is that the service infrastructure needs to grow, regardless of how difficult it is to navigate the U.S.' state-by-state restrictions.
""We have a service backlog where we're trying to build as much service infrastructure as fast as we can. But in some markets, the product scaling has happened faster than we can build out service infrastructure,"" Scaringe said. ""That's a short-term anomaly. Long term, we think in the United States we're going to a build a really robust service infrastructure. In Europe, the question is—we'll do sales on our own—but whether we partner with somebody on service. It's certainly an opportunity.""
If Rivian needs a service partner in Europe, I know a company in Wolfsburg it could probably call.

Auto Industry Urges Trump: 'Preserve The Tax Credits',https://insideevs.com/news/741977/auto-industry-trump-trump-credits/,"U.S. automakers wrote a letter to Trump pleading for regulations that are ""predictable"" and ""stable.""",2024-11-22 10:53:19,"A week after the U.S. elections, the country's top auto industry lobbying group wrote a letter to President-elect Donald Trump. It had a clear message: Don't mess with the electric vehicle tax credits. Of course, the group attempted to strike a far more subtle and diplomatic tone. But the urgency of that letter is palpable. Automakers want to continue manufacturing EVs and remain competitive with the rest of the world, especially China.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news shaping up the world of EVs. Also on today's list: General Motors will continue forging its path towards electrification and a recap of the Hyundai Motor Group's several new and refreshed models at the LA Auto Show. The best part: several Hyundai EVs will have the Tesla NACS charging port factory-fitted soon.
Of course they did. Walking back on EVs at this stage is equal to reversing years of technological progress. The likes of GM, Ford and the Hyundai Motor Group have invested billions of dollars in bringing EV manufacturing home with the help of the Biden administration's production incentives under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Plus the sales numbers speak for themselves. The third quarter witnessed record EV adoption in the U.S.
The New York Times has a big dive into the fight. ""Even as automakers invest in an increasingly connected, automated and electrified vehicle fleet, they face unprecedented geopolitical and market pressures—a point you also regularly made during the campaign,"" wrote John Bozella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry's top lobbying group that represents most legacy automakers, component suppliers and battery makers.
The letter, understandably, is poised at not irking the President-elect. There's no direct mention of the IRA. There's no mention of the EPA either, which has called for automakers to sell an increasing mix of EVs and hybrids from model year 2027 onwards. But none of this is a ""mandate,"" as many reports will have you believe.
That word gets thrown around unrestrained, sans nuance. Years from now, when you walk into a showroom, you will be able to choose from gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and maybe even hydrogen powertrains.
For now, here are some points from the letter urging the President-elect to maintain incentives for EVs and advance the framework for autonomous cars:
Support Reasonable and Achievable Emissions Regulations: To remain successful and competitive, the auto industry needs a stable and predictable regulatory environment. Automakers support reasonable and achievable federal and state emissions regulations aligned with current market realities that support a customer’ ability to purchase a vehicle that meets their individual needs. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to promote stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards.
Preserve Incentives that Support Global Competitiveness: Provisions in the tax code (including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) support the development of next-generation automotive technologies, including EVs, in the U.S. These incentives have fueled investment in domestic EV and battery manufacturing and increased good-paying jobs in automotive communities across the industrial base. The incentives help ensure the U.S. continues to lead in manufacturing critical to our national and economic security. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code.
Implement a Federal Regulatory Framework for AVs: As the current leader in the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, the US. is at the forefront of innovation that will transform personal mobility, improve roadway safety, and increase access to mobility for older adults and people with disabilities. Other countries, including China, are implementing regulatory frameworks to support the development and deployment of AVS, but the U.S. still lacks such a framework. Alliance for Automotive Innovation urges your administration to implement a federal regulatory framework for commercial deployment of AVS.
The impact of this message is unclear. Trump's ""first buddy"" and Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports ending the tax credits, saying it will only help Tesla. Tesla is years ahead of legacy OEMs in manufacturing EVs profitably.
However, Tesla also netted $2.1 billion from selling emissions credits to other automakers from January to September, which was 43% of its net profits, the New York Times reported. So we might be underestimating the impact of deleting the tax credits on Tesla's own balance sheets.
General Motor's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the automaker's EV efforts will continue even if related policies change next year. Speaking on November 20 at the Barclays Global Automotive And Mobility Tech Conference, Jacobson said that the ""technology would continue to win people over."" That may indicate how GM customers are reacting to its EVs.
Around the same time last year, GM appeared to be struggling with its EV transition. The popular Bolt EV's production ended and the automaker faced software issues and production challenges. But GM has turned things around over the past 12 months. It was America's second best-selling EV maker in Q3 and Chevy Equinox EV sales have taken off.
Here's what Jacobson said, according to Automotive News:
“Many of the things that we’re doing today are going to continue irrespective of what happens with the regulations,” Jacobson said.
“We’ve got to make sure that we have reasonable regulation alongside where consumers are and where demand is. The technology is going to continue to win people over, but we’ve got to be able to produce vehicles that our customers want,” he said. “We’re going to continue to work with the incoming administration and figure out the best path forward.”
Automakers are global companies. Someday, they may be able to break their supply chains away from China, but the network extends far beyond that. The U.S. car industry is intertwined with Asian, South American and European supply chains. And while the rest of the world moves towards electrification, U.S. automakers don't want to be left behind. Because this is not just about selling more EVs, it's a race for technological dominance, a race for energy independence and a race to prevent catastrophic climate change. Sure, GM's profits come from gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, but understanding this urgency is a positive early step.
The Hyundai Motor Group made quite a splash at the LA Auto Show this week. It not only showcased the three-row Ioniq 9, but also brought extensive upgrades to the 2025 Kia EV6 and showcased a 500 horsepower 2026 Kia EV9 GT.
They all have something in common: factory-fitted Tesla charging port. That's huge because it opens up access to tens of thousands of Tesla Superchargers. InsideEVs took a close look at the Ioniq 9, which has a bigger battery and better range than the Kia EV9 and comes will cool features like swiveling middle-row seats. Plus, its interior is festooned with tech. We have a whole video about how all of that works.
Kia also comprehensively upgraded the EV6 for 2025. It now has larger 63 kilowatt-hour (up from 58 kWh) and 84 kWh (up from 77.4 kWh) battery packs for the standard-range and long-range trims. It also has a slicker operating system and a more powerful GT trim. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Kia EV6.
If you're an enthusiast, you may also want to check out the new EV9 GT with over 500 horsepower. It gets simulated manual gear shifts like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N and also an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD). Kia really went all-in with this one.
Writing a letter to Trump's transition team urging it to preserve the tax credits is one thing. But convincing the President-elect may be a whole different ballgame. Trump has close friends in the oil and gas industry who would be happy to see the EV tax credits vanish. His pick to lead the U.S. Department of Energy is fracking veteran Chris Wright.
What else can automakers do to give the tax credits another four years (or more) of lifeline?

Can This EV Startup Prove That Electric Scooters Are Cool? Eh,https://www.rideapart.com/news/741252/infinite-machine-ev-startup-coming-soon-usa/,"Would you be willing to pay $10,000 USD for an e-scooter that looks like it came straight off the set of Interstellar?",2024-12-25 01:26:33,"Why do you ride motorcycles? Well, chances are there are tons of different reasons why you do. Perhaps some of you ride because it’s the practical choice. Or maybe some of you ride just for the thrill and freedom it gives you. Heck, maybe some of you ride simply because you think it’s cool and badass.
Regardless of your reasons for choosing to ride, it’s always in manufacturers’ best interest to give us consumers what we want. However, it seems that this hasn’t been the case, particularly in the electric motorcycle industry. I mean, sure, a lot of the new electric motorcycles we see on social media and on the internet are totally badass, oozing with tech, and looking like they came straight off the set of some steampunk movie. But let’s be real—does anyone even actually want them?
Perhaps even more importantly, does anyone have the disposable income to risk on one these machines, especially considering a lot of startups raise funds through massive pre-order campaigns?
Case in point just has to be New York-based startup Infinite Machine. We’ve talked about this company before, and how it wanted to change the perception of scooters from dorky, utility-focused machines to badass, futuristic vehicles that’ll turn heads anywhere you go. And in concept, this all makes sense. But here’s the kicker—selling a $10,000 USD electric scooter that leans in pretty much solely on tech and style just won’t cut it. Not now. And not in this economy where people are trying to get the most out of each and every dollar.
Infinite Machine says that its P1 electric scooter will begin reaching customers in 2025.
But Infinite Machine is adamant about pushing forward. You see, the company recently raised $9 million USD through an investment by a16z, a venture capital firm that invests in a variety of tech companies. Plus, Infinite Machine aims to begin deliveries of its P1 Launch Edition scooter by 2025, an electric scooter that will set you back a sweet $10,000. That's a heck of a lot for what this is. Take note, you can get a tried and tested commuter scooter like a Honda ADV 160 for less than half that money. Oh, and you can get an actual, real motorcycle—like a Kawasaki Z900RS, perhaps?
Listen, I get it. The Infinite Machine e-scooter is a highly specialized, extremely niche machine that will appeal to people who know exactly what it is they want. But when it comes to running a business, having a very narrow client base isn't exactly the best thing, especially when you're pretty much starting from scratch.
Nevertheless, Infinite Machine is confident that, amidst the closure of electric mobility startups left and right, it has what it takes to brave the storm. In fact, the company’s founders believe that now is a way better time to convince people to make the shift to electric two-wheelers than before.
And to a certain extent, it’s true. Mobility has evolved so much in recent years, and EV two-wheelers are gradually becoming part of the mainstream transport network. But if the goings on in the industry are anything to go by, affordable and accessible are way more important than techie and flashy.
But what do you think? Could Infinite Machine just be the EV startup that breaks the mold? Or will it fall into obscurity like so many before it?

"Northvolt, Hailed As Europe’s Future EV Battery Champion, Files For Bankruptcy",https://insideevs.com/news/741909/northvolt-ev-battery-maker-bankruptcy/,"""Northvolt's liquidity picture has become dire,"" the company said in its Chapter 11 petition.",2024-11-22 03:32:50,"Swedish-based Northvolt, which was seen as one of Europe’s best shots at fighting off China’s electric vehicle battery supremacy, filed for bankruptcy yesterday. The company said in its Chapter 11 petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas that its “liquidity picture has become dire.”
Northvolt, which has operations in California, has roughly $30 million in cash, which is enough to support it for only about a week. Meanwhile, it has $5.8 billion in debt. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will enable it to continue operations at a reduced scale and pay employees. The battery maker has also secured a $100 million loan from truck maker Scania, its biggest customer and one of the shareholders. Northvolt said the new loan is part of $245 million in financing support for the bankruptcy.
The restructuring process is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Northvolt Ett, the battery maker’s flagship gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, and Northvolt Labs in Västerås, Sweden will remain operational during the restructuring process. Northvolt Germany and Northvolt North America, subsidiaries of Northvolt AB with projects in Germany and Canada, are financed separately and will continue to operate as usual outside of the Chapter 11 process, the company said.
More Battery Manufacturing Stories
“This decisive step will allow Northvolt to continue its mission to establish a homegrown, European industrial base for battery production,” said Tom Johnstone, interim Chairman of the Board. “Despite near-term challenges, this action to strengthen our capital structure will allow us to capture the continued market demand for vehicle electrification. We are likewise pleased by the strong support we have received from our existing lenders and our customers.”
Northvolt manufactures lithium-ion battery cells used for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Volkswagen Group is its largest shareholder after an investment of roughly $1 billion. BMW Group was also briefly part of the investment group, pledging to pay $2 billion, but the deal fell through after BMW claimed Northvolt failed to deliver batteries on time.
The Swedish battery maker has two fully functional factories, one in Sweden and the other in Poland. Several other facilities are planned. The first customer deliveries were made in 2022, with the main factory in Sweden reportedly capable of producing 60 gigawatt-hours worth of batteries per year, enough for 1 million EVs. However, Northvolt said in its bankruptcy filing that it currently can produce 300,000 batteries per year.",Iulian Dnistran
'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To Kill EV Tax Credit,https://insideevs.com/news/741881/kia-trump-ev-tax-credit/,"“You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry,” Kia America COO Steve Center told InsideEVs on Thursday.",2024-11-21 17:11:31,"As Kia and its parent company the Hyundai Motor Group plan an onslaught of new U.S.-made electric vehicles aimed at winning American converts, the potential threat of losing the electric vehicle tax credits is like a dark cloud hanging over everything. But one senior Kia executive at the LA Auto Show said what the rest of the auto industry is all but certainly thinking right now: President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to kill the EV tax credit would be disruptive to jobs and the trajectory of the entire American car business.
“It would just be dumb,” Kia America COO and Executive Vice President Steve Center told InsideEVs in an interview on Thursday. “[The government has] steered the industry in a direction, and I think you need to allow the industry to recover its investments and then let it float.”
The South Korean automaker has invested heavily to bring manufacturing of its EV6 and EV9 electric models to Georgia, in part to comply with the $7,500 purchase incentive’s North American assembly requirement. It’s adjusted supply chains to meet restrictions around battery and component sourcing for qualifying vehicles. While current Kias aren’t eligible, some upcoming 2025 models built in the U.S. should be. The same is true at Kia's corporate cousin Hyundai, which is aiming to entice American buyers to go electric with U.S.-made cars like the Ioniq 5 and new Ioniq 9.
The 2025 Kia EV6 GT
Now Hyundai Motor Group and other carmakers are staring down a future where massive investments in EV models and domestic EV manufacturing are worth less. Various analyses have found that U.S. demand for electric cars would drop without the incentive; the same has happened in places like Europe as well. That would be disruptive to an industry that's invested a lot of money and long-term plans into electrification, Center said.
“You’re pulling the rug out from under the whole industry. And quite frankly, it isn’t just Kia and the import brands,” he said. “A lot of other companies have spent a lot of money trying to comply with the regulations.”
He said the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law that included the latest revision to the EV tax credits, has created jobs and supported the environment.
“It’s just bad policy to keep changing. So you don’t like it? Pick on something else you don’t like that isn’t going to hurt the biggest industry in the country,” Center said.
Kia EV9 GT
Reuters this month reported that the Trump transition team is drawing up plans to eliminate the credit as part of broader tax reform, sending shockwaves through the EV industry. The provision aims to drum up demand for battery-powered cars and also to wean the U.S. auto industry off of Chinese battery supply chains.
Trump would need Congress, which now has a Republican majority, to cooperate here. But it’s still yet to be seen whether the plan will withstand pressure from the auto industry and from lawmakers whose constituents benefit from new EV factories and jobs. It’s also unclear whether Trump plans to attack the commercial clean-vehicle credit, which subsidizes EV leases.
The End Of The EV Tax Credit?
Following the Reuters report, the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group representing EV and battery companies, released a statement defending the policy. “If the U.S. is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal—like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit—aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,” said Albert Gore, the group’s executive director.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry’s largest lobbying group, urged Congress in October to keep IRA policies intact so its members can stay competitive with China as the global car market electrifies.
The change in policy could deal a blow to EV sales, Center said. But at the same time, it’s not a doomsday scenario.
“It’s bad. It will hurt. Is it going to kill everything? I don’t think so, because people are buying these cars, and they’re leasing these cars,” he said. “It’s a sweetener. It aids mass adoption.”
Kia EV9 GT
At the moment, Kia doesn’t sell any vehicles that qualify for the full buying credit, though it plans to. Building the EV9 and EV6 in the U.S. should help it get there. Its customers can benefit from the $7,500 leasing incentive, which doesn’t enforce eligibility or manufacturing requirements for vehicles.
Getting rid of the EV purchase incentive may not have a huge impact in part because of the policy’s household income requirements, Center said. Plus, charging infrastructure is still the main barrier to adoption, in his view.
He said that if the administration kills the tax credit, they should at least do so gradually. “It’s messed up,” Center said. “But I would say if you must eliminate it, have a ramp down.”

Citroen’s DS Teases Slippery 466-Mile Electric Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/741874/ds8-electric-fastback-crossover-teaser/,"Even though the information came to us in a partly redacted form, we’re excited about the fancy new tall fastback from DS.",2024-11-21 15:00:19,"Automakers are always looking for new and innovative ways to build anticipation for something they’re about to release and/or are especially proud of. We’ve seen all possible parts of a car teased and even car brand revamps presented like they were fashion shows, but now DS is blanking out words in the press release for a new model.
Its upcoming posh tall fastback EV will have a claimed WLTP range of 466 miles (750 km)... and other features that we can only guess by the length of the word.
The thing about the press release is that the blacked-out words look like an afterthought, not a marketing department’s brilliant idea to create hype in a new way—it looks like they decided to conceal these things at the last moment. What could DS be hiding in between the vehicle’s matrix LED lights, and what could they be framing that it needed to be redacted?
Not that the upcoming crossover, which may be called the DS8, isn’t cool. The teaser shots show a lightly camouflaged prototype wearing its production body, sporting aggressive fascias and a very dramatic roofline. Its boomerang-like front and rear light clusters define the corners of the car in a similar way to how Cadillac does it in its latest models.
The upcoming DS8 is the production version of the DS Aero Sport Lounge concept unveiled back in 2020 when it was touted as turning travel into art. Even though it’s a high-riding vehicle, DS still touts a 0.24 drag coefficient, which goes some way toward explaining the range advantage it has over other vehicles built on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform.
It will likely get the same 96.9 kWh (usable) battery as other related models, like the Peugeot 3008 EV, whose range rating in Europe is 434 miles (700 km), or 32 miles (50 km) less. Charging from 20 to 80% takes the Peugeot 27 minutes, and 93 miles (150 km) can be added in 10 minutes.
More On This
You can’t get the electric Peugeot 3008 with the long-range battery and all-wheel drive. The big-battery model is only available in single-motor configuration with 227 horsepower. The 321 hp dual-motor 3008 has a smaller 73 kWh battery. This means that DS has either found a way of pairing the dual-motor setup with the big battery or the DS8 will be front-wheel drive.
DS announced a few years ago that it was only going to launch pure-electric vehicles after 2024. However, in light of recent trends shown by the EV market, DS could switch back to combustion given that the STLA Medium platform can also take combustion powertrains with all levels of electrification (mild hybrid, hybrid and plug-in hybrid), so we can’t rule that out—Peugeot offers the 3008 and 5008 as plug-in hybrids.
The manufacturer says it will reveal more about the upcoming model before the end of the year. We really hope to learn what it is that the driver’s seat provides that we were not ready to see yet.",Andrei Nedelea
The Rivian R2 And R3 Probably Won't Be 800-Volt,https://insideevs.com/news/741862/rivian-r2-r3-800v-400v/,Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told reporters that the company can deliver competitive charge times on a 400-volt system.,2024-11-21 14:00:03,"Rivian has not yet announced whether its forthcoming R2 and R3 midsize cars will use a 400-volt architecture or a more expensive 800- or 900-volt system. Fans may be hoping that the next generation of products will move to a higher-voltage architecture, which typically can allow for faster charging and more efficiency. But after sitting down with Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, I don't think that's likely.
In a roundtable with reporters, Scaringe said that while there are benefits to going 800-volt, they're more important for bigger batteries. Larger packs—like those in the R1—are more likely to be voltage-constrained. But with a smaller pack like we're expecting to see in the R2 and R3, Scaringe says battery chemistry is a bigger limiter than voltage.
In the R2, the move is ""just not as critical,"" he said. ""R2 we've optimized more around cost, to make sure we deliver great performance but [at] these price points. I don't think it's as important in a smaller vehicle.
He stopped short of confirming directly that the products would be on a 400-volt architecture, but he sounded quite convinced that an 800-volt system wasn't necessary for R2 or R3. The larger R1 will ""need to transition"" to an 800- or 900-volt setup, he said, but didn't say when. Such a substantial change is unlikely until the vehicle's next redesign.
Hyundai, Kia, Lucid and Porsche have all been bullish on 800- or 900-volt architectures. Their cars show why the technology is appealing: A relatively affordable Hyundai Ioniq 6 can zip from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes. A Porsche Taycan can do it in 16. That's blazing fast. But Scaringe says that the focus on voltage is misplaced. While an 800-volt pack can deliver charging speeds of 350 kW or higher, in most smaller or mid-size vehicles the voltage isn't the limiter.
""We think ultimately the charge times need to be sub-20 minutes for that 10-80 time. We're 100% aligned on that. You can get there with [400v],"" he said. A 450-volt charger running at 500 amps can deliver 225 kW. If a car with a sub-100-kWh pack could sustain those speeds, it'd be capable of doing 10-80% in 20 minutes. Look no further than Hyundai for proof. Despite its 800-volt architecture, a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Ioniq 6 will ""only"" peak around 220-230 kW. Some 400-volt cars like the Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1 can hit similar numbers. The Hyundais just hold higher speeds for longer, allowing for those ultra-fast charge times.
But that shows that the voltage isn't really the problem. Many existing battery packs just cannot accept that much energy for long enough to deliver those sorts of times. An 800-volt system would probably help, but cell chemistry and battery cooling is more important, Scaringe says. He didn't mention it, but the implication is that its ""4695"" cylindrical sells the company plans to use in the R2 and R3 should have better thermals than existing batteries.
We'll see if they're good enough to hit the sub-20-minute charge time goal. Right now, Rivian has only claimed that the R2 and R3 will be able to do a 10-80% charge in ""under 30 minutes."" Getting to a sub-20 time is a much tougher challenge. Given that Scaringe noted it as a long-term goal rather than a promise, there's no word on whether the R2 or R3 will get there. If they do, though, it likely won't be with the help of an 800-volt architecture.

"You're Welcome, Tesla Owners. Kia Just Moved Its Charging Port",https://insideevs.com/news/741740/kia-ev6-charging-port-tesla/,"Kia moved the charging port on the 2025 EV6 to the left side of the vehicle, which should make for smoother Supercharger access.",2024-11-21 13:00:02,"Kia will move the charging port on the 2025 EV6 crossover to the left side of the vehicle from the right side, the brand announced on Thursday. If you ask the Tesla owners who will soon share their beloved Supercharger stations with Kia drivers and many others, that's the right side to have it on.
That update comes as part of a wider refresh to the EV6 that broke cover on Thursday. The 2025 model gets a new mug, more range and, perhaps most importantly, a Tesla-style charging port built right in. Thanks to an integrated North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, the EV6 will soon be able to charge up at thousands of Tesla Superchargers without using a dongle of any kind. That access opens up in January.
Read Up On The NACS Transition
But simply working with Tesla to grant Supercharger access (they used to be reserved for Tesla owners only, but that's gradually changing) doesn't guarantee the charging process at those locations will easy or hiccup-free. Since Tesla began letting outsiders use its stations, it's become clear that the location of a car's charging port can make or break the charging experience—both for the car's owner and the station's other patrons.
2025 Kia EV6
Supercharger stalls are designed with short cords and for Teslas only, and all Teslas have their charging port at the back left of the vehicle. So when a non-Tesla shows up with its port in the ""wrong"" place, the owner can't simply back into the appropriate spot like a Model Y or Model 3 could. They may have to straddle two parking spaces or park horizontally across them just to get the cord to reach.
Understandably, that's been pissing off Tesla owners left and right. It's awkward for the person causing the nuisance too.

Enter Kia. The brand not only gave the 2025 EV6 a NACS port—it also relocated the port the left rear fender to mimic Tesla's setup. (The high-performance EV6 GT won't get the same update, however.) Kia didn't explicitly mention the parking problem in its press release, only saying that the new port and location serve to ""make charging more convenient.""
But everybody knows this is an issue, including Tesla. On its website, it recommends that non-Tesla owners ""avoid parking diagonally to reach the cable and try to obstruct as few charge posts as possible,"" and shows how they should do so in a handy illustration.
""Additionally, we encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side,"" Tesla adds.
This may only be a temporary bug of the great NACS transition, though. Gas stations have no problem dealing with cars that have their gas caps on either side of the vehicle. We're starting to see EV charging stations with that kind of pull-through design coming online too. And Tesla says its new V4 charging cabinets will better accommodate other EVs.

The 2025 Kia EV6 GT Gets Ioniq 5 N-Style 'Virtual Gear Shift',https://insideevs.com/news/741857/kia-ev6-gt-virtual-shifter/,"Simulated gear shifts will pair well with 641 horsepower, don't you think?",2024-11-21 12:50:00,"Just admit it: you love the idea of simulated gear shifting in electric vehicles. Oh, you may act like you hate the anachronistic idea of changing ""gears"" in a car that technically only has a one-speed transmission because it ruins the ""purity"" of the smooth and efficient EV experience. Or maybe you're a gas car purist and the idea of trying to simulate a transmission is, at best, like watching a clip of your favorite band on someone's Instagram reel when you could have had a front-row seat to the show instead.
But deep down, you know you're wrong. And you wish every EV could do that. How do I know this? Because every single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all.
Even Jeremy Clarkson calls the Ioniq 5 N ""as much fun as is humanly possible."" Jeremy Clarkson! A man who made an entire career out of being very mad that it's not 1968 anymore. Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once.

And joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut today at the LA Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature.
""The GT’s new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,"" Kia officials said in a news release. And that's all they have to say for now, but we'll try and get more at the show itself if we can.
Since Kia and Hyundai are owned by the same parent company but are technically separate entities, the news release does not mention the Ioniq 5 N. Yet it's clear that something similar will now be added to the Ioniq 5's platform-mate, the EV6. And on the Hyundai, the ""N e-Shift"" feature really goes the distance.
2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N First Drive Review
That car simulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission using the paddles normally used to adjust regenerative braking intensity on other Hyundai Motor Group cars. When activated—and it has a normal ""drive"" setting as any DCT would—it works much the same way: left paddle to go down a ""gear,"" right to go up. Of course, the EVs do not have multiple forward gears. They have so much instant torque that gears are not necessary to achieve different speeds as they would be on a gas engine, which puts power to the wheels far less efficiently.
But the Ioniq 5 N is also special for how it simulates the ""feel"" of gear shifting, including the jolt and brief interruption in power that happens and the mechanical resistance that's normal upon downshifting. The Ioniq 5 N also simulates engine sounds through the speakers, will let you rev the ""engine"" while parked and has a ""redline"" you'll hit before you need to shift again. It's all great fun.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red
Based on Kia's statement, we can expect some version of that for the EV6, but I'm eager to see Kia's spin on things. I'm sure engineers will find some way to make it fairly unique to this car.
Beyond that, we know a few other specs, including power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. With GT Mode activated, you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque. Unlike the rest of the EV6 line, the GT will still be made in South Korea, not Kia's Georgia factory, so it won't qualify for U.S. EV tax credits at purchase. Pricing has not been released yet, nor have official photos: what you see above is the European-spec Kia EV6 GT-Line, which is visually similar.
So now we're all wondering the same thing, right? The new Kia EV6 GT, or the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N? We have reason to believe the Kia is a hotted-up version of the existing model with a ton of extra power and some new tricks, while the Hyundai is a top-to-bottom performance car rework that's meant for track day duty. But the EV6 GT may still be no slouch. This a showdown we'll have to take to the track in 2025 so we can find out.

"2026 Kia EV9 GT: Sporty Electric SUV With Native Tesla NACS Port, Virtual Gear Shifts",https://insideevs.com/news/741837/2026-kia-ev9-gt-specs-nacs-port/,Meet Kia’s most powerful three-row SUV. It just happens to be electric.,2024-11-21 12:45:00,"This is the all-new 2026 Kia EV9 GT. Not to be confused with the EV9 GT-Line which was already available with some sporty-looking hardware, the newly introduced version is Kia’s most powerful production three-row SUV.
Boasting a dual-motor powertrain with a total estimated output of 510 horsepower, the Kia EV9 GT is 122 hp more powerful than the EV9 GT-Line. That’s enough to propel the sporty electric family hauler from zero to 60 miles per hour in an estimated 4.3 seconds, seven-tenths of a second quicker than the GT-Line.
The front motor of the EV9 GT makes 214 hp while the rear drive unit pumps out 362 hp, but because they don’t reach peak power at the same time, you can’t just add the numbers together. The torque figure was not disclosed by the Korean automaker.
More Kia Stories
Kia’s go-fast family hauler adopts a rather controversial feature from the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N–Virtual Gear Shifts. We quite liked the simulated gear shifts when we drove the refreshed Ioniq 5 N, but there are plenty of people out there who think an EV–which doesn’t actually have gears–shouldn’t try to impersonate a gas-powered car. This includes some folks at Porsche who said such a feature will only make their cars worse.
The system works in conjunction with the in-cabin electric Active Sound Design (e-ASD) system to make it feel like the car shifts through gears while accelerating. The EV jolts when it goes from one virtual gear to another and the sound system provides the audio cues to tie it all together.
The EV9 GT is Kia’s first three-row SUV to get electronically controlled suspension or ECS. This can soften or harden the suspension damping based on what driving mode has been selected: Normal, Eco, Sport or My Drive. These modes also alter the steering and brake feel. Speaking of brakes, the flagship EV9 gets larger front rotors than the lesser versions.
At the rear, there’s an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD), just like on the EV6 GT, which limits wheelspin to the tires with less grip. Meanwhile, the 7.8-inch ground clearance is the same as on the other trim levels, as is the 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity of the GT-Line.
Just like the new Hyundai Ioniq 5, Genesis Electrified GV70 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, the 2026 Kia EV9 GT comes with Tesla’s NACS charging port from the factory. This means owners will be able to charge at Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network without an adapter. However, an adapter will be needed to charge at DC fast chargers with CCS plugs, like the vast majority of stalls operated by companies like EVgo, Electrify America and ChargePoint.
Kia said that all EV9 versions will come as standard with the NACS charging port starting in the first half of next year. The battery of the EV9 GT is the same as on the other long-range versions–99.8 kilowatt-hours–but the automaker hasn’t provided a range rating or a maximum charging speed. For reference, the EV9 GT-Line has an EPA-rated range of 270 miles and can accept up to 235 kW from a DC fast charger, enough for a 10% to 80% top-up in less than 25 minutes.
“The EV9 has been a home run for Kia and introduced the first mass-market electric three-row SUV,” said Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America. “And EV9 GT includes all those wonderful elements while amping up the fun factor significantly. This new halo trim is set to spark the hearts of driving enthusiasts who still need the practicality of a six-passenger SUV. You can have your cake and eat it too!”
Outside, the 2026 Kia comes with 21-inch wheels wrapped in 285/45R21 high-performance Continental tires. The brake calipers are painted in neon green and GT-exclusive patterns on the Active Air Flaps in front.
Inside, the cabin is adorned with bright green accents, including on the steering wheel and seats, both of which are unique to the EV9 GT. The standard kit includes Parking Collision Assist with front, side and rear monitoring, as well as Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Navigation-based Smart Cruise Control and others.
Pricing for the 2026 Kia EV9 GT has not been announced yet. However, we know it will go on sale in the latter half of next year. We also know that it will be assembled in South Korea, so any potential federal tax credit when purchasing goes out the window (leasing might make it eligible for a tax credit, if there will still be a tax credit for EVs in 2025.)",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Kia EV6: Made In America With A Tesla NACS Plug, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741756/2025-kia-ev6-specs-us/,Kia's groundbreaking EV6 makes a big comeback for 2025. The new face isn't even the big story here.,2024-11-21 12:45:00,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 gets a lot of well-deserved glory in the electric vehicle space. But personally, I'm more a fan of its cousin, the Kia EV6. So much so that I bought one earlier this year and am strongly considering acquiring it outright whenever my lease is up. But when I look at the changes coming with the updated 2025 Kia EV6, I may just have to consider an upgrade.
What's better now about Kia's electric crossover? Basically, everything. The EV6 will now be built in the U.S. to qualify for at least some EV tax credits; packs more range thanks to a bigger battery; offers a redesigned face and interior; and will come out of the gate with a newly-relocated Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to that vast network of DC fast-chargers.
There's a lot to cover here, so let's dig in.
The EV6 originally debuted way back in 2021 and now sees its most substantive update yet. We've already seen its newly redesigned face—a ""Star Map"" grille designed to more closely match other modern Kia offerings—as the second-generation model has been on sale for a few months in places like Europe and its native South Korea. But the U.S.-spec version comes with more surprises than we anticipated.
The EV6 now gets two battery options in larger sizes than the previous car, offering more range. The base, smaller battery is now 63 kilowatt-hours in size, up from 58 kWh previously, while the larger battery goes from 77.4 kWh to 84 kWh. While exact range figures for each trim level have not been released, Kia claims the Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line models will target 319 miles of range in rear-wheel-drive configuration.
2025 Kia EV6
There's no word yet on range for the dual-motor all-wheel-drive models, unfortunately. But we're expecting all range figures to be generally similar to the 2025 Ioniq 5 that uses the same battery setups, so likely around 290 or more miles of range for the AWD versions. Either way, those should be decent upgrades from the current EV6; the RWD models are currently listed at 310 miles of EPA-rated range and 282 for AWD models (which drops to 252 and 218 miles for the GT-Line and GT variants, respectively.) Considering that my own EV6 Wind AWD regularly tops 300 miles of range on a 100% charge when the weather is fair, those could be much more consistently above that.
Power is roughly similar across the board, however. The Light RWD model is rated at 167 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque, while more powerful RWD models in Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line forms come in at 225 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. Upgrading to AWD gets you 320 hp and 446 lb.-ft. of torque as before.
But I'm happy to say the go-fast Kia EV6 GT gets even more powerful now, which it absolutely didn't need, but nobody's going to say no to more power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. Turn on GT Mode and you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque to adequately meet any Lamborghini-hunting needs that may arise in your community.
2025 Kia EV6
I'll readily admit I'm not the biggest fan of the updated grille. But the EV6 still looks as sharp as ever, and it offers more than just a new face here. The taillights also add Star Map details, while the front and rear bumper have new designs with sharper angles and a more aggressive overall stance. Kia's also offering new designs for its 19- to 21-inch wheels.
2025 Kia EV6
The inside is pretty familiar but with a few notable tweaks. The steering wheel has been totally redesigned, and the EV6 finally gets the fully updated Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) operating system that offers quicker speeds, higher-definiton graphics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates—something the current EV6 has only done with navigation and a handful of other core features. Basically, the software setup on the EV6 now mirrors that of the EV9, which gets high marks from us. And like the EV9, you now get access to the new Kia Connect Store for downloads like displays themed after your favorite NBA teams. (Yes, really.) The Digital Key setup has been improved to offer true smartphone-activated door unlocking, remote starting and driving.
And finally, the flush door handles now pop open automatically across all trim levels. That fixes one of my biggest gripes about the current EV6 and may justify an upgrade on that alone.
Kia's unfortunately not telling us much about the EV6's legendary fast-charging. The car can go from a 10% charge to 80% in just about 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast-charger, and we don't expect that to change. However, like the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and updated Genesis Electrified GV70 that also debuted at the LA Auto Show this week, the revised EV6 packs a NACS plug from the factory now. And it's been moved to the other side of the car—the driver's side instead of the passenger's—to make charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations a little easier.
2025 Kia EV6
And best of all, the revised EV6 is now American-made, just like the 2025 Ioniq 5. This one is made at Kia's West Point, Georgia assembly plant alongside the EV9, so it should qualify for at least some of the $7,500 EV tax credits when purchased. Those may soon vanish, so take advantage of them while you can. (The EV6 GT will continue to be built in Korea.)
Kia says that like the outgoing car, the 2025 EV6 will be available in Light (RWD only), Light Long Range (RWD or AWD), Wind (RWD or AWD), GT-Line (RWD or AWD), and GT (AWD) trims. The automaker says it's expected to go on sale in the first half of next year. Pricing and other specs will be announced at a later date.
All in all, the 2025 model year represents a big upgrade for one of the best-equipped, best-looking and best-performing EVs in its class. Expect more on this as we get it.

Rivian's CEO Thinks It Can Be Besties With Scout,https://insideevs.com/news/741730/rivian-rj-scaringe-scout-coexist/,"Plus, Lucid isn't scared of tax credits going away and Lotus abandons its all-EV approach.",2024-11-21 11:08:35,"Have you thought about how small the EV segment really is? Today, fewer than one in ten new vehicles sold in the U.S. are BEVs. Now start to think about what kind of buyer each EV attracts—you've got high-ranking execs picking up Porsches, glamping outdoorsy folk looking at Rivian and then there's anyone not looking at a Tesla scoping out GM and VW. Niches exist, which is exactly what Rivian's CEO is banking on being what separates its customers from others and allows the brand to coexist.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Rivian and Scout's budding bromance, Lucid scoffing at the EV tax credit kerfuffle, plus, Lotus scrapping its EV-only plan in favor of EREVs. Let's jump in
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been playing it surprisingly cool as Volkswagen brings its new rough-and-tough brand up to bat. See, Scout is really the first true competitor for Rivian—sure, other EVs exist, but Scout is the first brand to bring strong, rugged battery power in the shape of a truck and blend the lifestyle component along with it.
The threat of competition hasn't fazed Scaringe, though. In fact, in a recent media roundtable, the CEO even nodded to the notion of the two brands coexisting without problem. Why, you might ask? Well, according to Electrek, Scaringe says there are ""less than five"" compelling EVs in the sub-$50,000 price range, which should make differentiating itself from the competition by simply making a better product surprisingly easy.
You may have noticed that Rivian and Scout have been getting awfully cozy lately. You can thank Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen for that, as this move has enabled Scout to take advantage of the new Rivian-sourced tech—namely the zonal architecture—which is available as part of the agreement. While great news for all involved, the tech sharing has blurred the line between brands a bit, which means that we should once again shout this from the rooftops: Rivian and Scout are not the same.
Not the same brand, not the same chassis, not even the same underpinnings outside of the zonal architecture and some software. Hell, despite some overlap, the two brands aren't even targeting same target audience. Rivian is marketing to EV enthusiasts with active outdoor lifestyles, while Scout is banking on nostalgia to sell an efficient blue-collar work truck. It's like Patagonia jacket versus Carhartt overalls—and that's why they can coexist.
Scaringe's optimism isn't without warrant. The EV segment still makes up less than 10% of America's new vehicle registrations, which makes it still pretty small. And with the threat of a repealed EV tax credit eating into adoption rates, that leaves plenty of time for brands to start filling up the market with their own cars, trucks, and other battery-powered people movers. In case you forgot, the Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevy Silverado EV and Tesla Cybertruck all exist, too. Again, each of these has some overlap with Rivian and Scout, but still cater to a specific customer.
So, at least for now, the segment seems harmonious. Both brands live in their own corners and are attracting their own customers, blissfully aware that the other exists and unfazed by the other's existence. But will the friendly competition last if either brand starts to grow and offer more ""normie"" versions of their cars for the mass market? Only time will tell.
It seems like the whole auto industry is holding its breath over the future of the $7,500 EV tax credit—everyone except for Lucid, that is. Lucid's attitude is apathetic at best, with CEO Peter Rawlinson throwing a big fat shrug at the unknown rather than sweating whether or not Lucid's future hinges on the incoming Trump administration doing away with the EV tax credit.
“Lucid, amongst all the EV makers, is really the most immune from that,” said Rawlinson in an interview with Bloomberg, referencing the possible revocation of the $7,500 EV tax credit.
See, Lucid is in a unique position: it doesn't need the credit. In fact, the only vehicle that it sells today—the $69,900-and-up Lucid Air—doesn't even qualify for it because the cheapest model starts above the $55,000 threshold for electric sedans. Lucid hasn't said whether or not its upcoming Gravity model (which technically starts within the $80,000 cut-off limit for SUVs) qualifies for the tax credit, but judging by Rawlinson's comment, it doesn't seem to matter:
Rawlinson believes that the tech in Lucid's vehicle, soon-to-be vehicles, speaks for itself and will help guide the automaker into the next phase of its Gravity-fed growth. The CEO feels that the EV startup has even surpassed Tesla in industry-leading efficiency, so having Elon Musk at the ear of the president-elect for favorable treatment seems to put very little fear in Lucid's business:
“We’ve really taken the mantle of technology leadership from Tesla right now, and this is not really sufficiently recognized,"" said Rawlinson. ""So, I think we’re in a very strong position to weather any such storm.”
These are bold words for a car company that is projected to sell just half of a percent (yes, 0.5%) of the number of cars compared to the company it claims to have stolen the tech crown from. Rawlinson seems to be convinced that people will be lining up to buy a Lucid because it's a Lucid, not because it happens to be the best deal out there because of a meager $7,500 discount.
But then again, if Rawlinson is right, it could finally be Lucid's time to shine amongst the luxury nameplates. The automaker still needs to overcome its currently unprofitable carmaking operation before all of its investor funds dry up (again), which is what it appears to be depending on the Gravity to help with. But the tax credit? Not so much.
Lotus has always been the brand that cares more about cornering than cupholders. The driver-centric approach was Lotus' niche, but with years of bleak sales amid other premium brands, the same technique would also almost be its coup de grace. Thankfully, Chinese automaker Geely extended a lifeline—one that would transform the brand into an all-electric lifestyle brand, or so we thought.
The British racing brand previously committed to electrifying its lineup by 2028, and it seemed on track to do exactly that as it introduced its Eletre SUV. But now, Lotus seems to be taking the same road as other brands and ripping up plans for an EV-only future. But rather than commit to a new ICE powertrain, Lotus is instead looking to the spectrum of hybridization in Geely's parts bins. Now, it could soon offer plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and extended-range EV (EREV) options.
“At Lotus, we have always chosen the best power technology available, whether it’s pure gasoline, pure electric, hybrid or range-extended [EV],” said Lotus CEO Feng Qingfeng in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, according to AutoCar.
Feng said that Lotus previously rejected plug-in hybrids because they were a compromise compared to pure EVs. While Lotus appears to have rethought this for future models, the brand isn't completely sold on only EVs or only PHEVs. Instead, it will also look to EREVs—that is, an EV with a combustion-powered generator to charge the battery like Scout's Harvester and Ram's Ramcharger—to complete its lineup.
It's hard not to ignore that this goes against just about everything Lotus stood for in its early racing days. I can't help but think of that line famously uttered by founder Colin Chapman: “simplify, then add lightness."" Maybe it's the purist in me, but this feels more like ""complicate, then add compromise."" But, then again, the purist-driven financials clearly aren't on Lotus' side.
So scoff at this direction if you must, but for Lotus, the move here is less about tradition and more about staying afloat in a market where Chinese smartphone makers can build 1,548-horsepower EVs that destroy Nurburgring records for breakfast. Stay tuned to see how this chapter for Lotus plays out in the long run.
New car buyers are quickly finding themselves with options that never existed before. EVs are starting to penetrate the market, and they offer pretty darn competitive in-class performance compared to gas-powered cars. Think: more seating area, more cargo space, better acceleration. It's a compelling argument if you're not worried about the slightly elevated cost or range anxiety.
I still find myself window-shopping gas cars and EVs constantly (impractically, if I'm being real with myself). And with limited options out there, it's easy to start crossing segments and comparing models that aren't even out yet. For example, the GR Corolla versus the upcoming Rivian R3X—one of them won't be on the streets for years and the other will surely undergo a refresh or be discontinued by the time it launches.
More realistic are the luxury and truck segments. For example, The Porsche Taycan versus the BMW 5-series, or the F-150 versus F-150 Lightning. A more practical example would be the Chevy Blazer EV and the Mazda CX-50.
There are plenty of options here, and I want to know which gas car you last cross-shopped with an EV. Let me know in the comments.",Rob Stumpf
The Mercedes CLA EV Will Have Both Tesla NACS And Type1 (J1772) Plugs (UPDATED),https://insideevs.com/news/741249/nacs-ccs-mercedes-cla-ev/,Both charging ports will be on the same side of the car under the same charging flap.,2024-11-21 10:49:49,"Correction and update: Mercedes-Benz officials initially told InsideEVs and other outlets that the upcoming CLA-Class would be equipped with both CCS1 and NACS fast-charging ports. The manufacturer has reached out to now clarify that this is incorrect.  It will, in fact, feature a Type1 (J1772) port for AC charging and a NACS port for DC fast charging. You will be able to fast-charge from a CCS1 station via a CCS1-to-NACS adapter. The original article follows below.
Most manufacturers selling electric vehicles in the U.S. have announced that they will begin switching from the typical Combined Charging System (CCS) plug to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug this year and next. Tesla's slimmer, sleeker plug type is expected to become the most common type of charger in the coming years, and adding access to the Tesla Supercharger network will be a godsend for American EV drivers everywhere. Mercedes will be the first German automaker to do so starting with the upcoming CLA-Class EV. But the Silver Arrow brand is doing something very novel and interesting here.
While in Germany at Mercedes’ Sindelfingen factory, InsideEVs learned that it will actually come with both NACS and CCS charging ports—a very unique proposition. If that’s not unusual enough, the two charging ports will be located on the right side of the car, stacked one on top of the other under the same charging port door.

Mercedes CLA Teaser (2025)
Mercedes recently published a set of teaser photos featuring a thinly veiled CLA prototype wearing revealing camouflage, which appeared to have flaps on both flanks. We thought it signaled the arrival of a plug-in hybrid variant. However, Mercedes confirmed that the vehicle in the teaser shots was the EV, which only had one charging port door on its right flank. It will only make the pure electric or non-plug-in hybrid CLA with a brand-new engine and hybrid system.
Mercedes-Benz CLA Class
Having the two most common types of charging ports will greatly improve the CLA’s versatility, giving owners the freedom to charge from Tesla Superchargers or any national public fast charging network natively without the need for an adapter. These adapters have sometimes proven problematic, and eliminating the need for one will result in a better user experience, which is what Mercedes is banking on with the CLA.
We saw plenty of camouflaged CLA prototypes driving around the Sindelfingen factory, and it looks like a bigger and more grown-up car than its predecessor. It’s also the first to be built on the 800-volt Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA), which will spawn three more models, including a shooting brake CLA and two crossovers (one of which will probably be a GLB-like seven-seater).
The high-voltage platform allows the CLA EV to charge at up to 320 kilowatts, enough to add 186 miles (300 kilometers) in 10 minutes with en-route preconditioning. It’s worth noting that even the latest V4 Tesla Supercharger is still officially limited to 250 kW of power (although Tesla wants to upgrade it to provide over 300 kW), so you will likely need a 350 kW CCS station to be able to match the official power claim.",Andrei Nedelea
"Zero’s 'Intelligent Aero' Takes From F1, But True Benefits Remain To Be Seen",https://www.rideapart.com/news/740983/zero-intelligent-aero-wmc-duct/,"It's definitely a step forward, but I'm beginning to question the direction.",2024-12-25 01:26:38,"I’m going to offer you an electric motorcycle, with a realistic 90-mile range for around 150% of the cost of a comparable ICE. What do you say? You don’t need to answer, sales figures and the general vibe of the motorcycle community have answered for you. Electric motorcycles are going until manufacturers address the cost and/or range issues, and Zero is, but not in the traditional way.
Zero Motorcycles collaborated with White Motorcycle Concepts (WMC), which is the company behind the British electric motorcycle land-speed world-record program, to incorporate WMC’s patented intelligent aerodynamic duct on a re-engineered Zero SR/S concept bike.
Although we don’t have any figures that’d indicate exactly how the duct would improve the SR/S’s performance figures, we know it’d result in a 10% reduction in aerodynamic drag.
WMC’s in-house engineering teams used processes and procedures learned whilst working on Formula 1 to help develop this proof of concept. But, just like in F1, the benefits of the aero duct don’t really come into play until the bike reaches higher speeds.
Aerodynamics is a hot topic, especially in MotoGP, where winglets and other devices improve lap times, though this efficiency benefit does not always translate to retail bikes. Our intelligent aero duct enhances aerodynamic efficiency, positively impacting upon power consumption, especially at high speeds.” said Robert White, Founder & CEO, of White Motorcycle Concepts.
So we get a 10% reduction in drag, but that’s only fully coming into play at higher speeds. Improved efficiency at highway speeds is a key area to focus on in the electric motorcycle world, as an electric bike’s range takes such a heavy blow at higher speeds that it makes using one untenable for plenty of people. But how much of a tangible improvement this technology will make to the SR/S’s range remains to be seen.
A step in the right direction, for sure, but not something to let you rest on your laurels. And that’s why one line from Zero’s press release made me somewhat concerned,
“The aerodynamic efficiency gain can be used to extend range or lower costs, reducing the need for a larger battery, which in turn cuts down on weight, charge time, and battery expenses.”
Unless Zero is about to pull a solid-state battery out of its behind, this technology won’t “reduce the need for a larger battery”. By all accounts, it seems like this intelligent aero system would make the bike marginally more efficient, meaning Zero would use a marginally smaller battery, so the savings to the customer would be, you guessed it, marginal.
Even if you can make electric motorcycles a bit cheaper, but for the majority of ICE riders who log serious miles, range will still keep electric bikes off the table. With that said, I have to imagine, regardless of what that line from the press release says, that Zero knows the biggest hurdle to electric motorcycle adoption lies in advancing battery technology so that price and range become a non-issue.
How much range would you need to consider replacing your ICE bike with an electric motorcycle? Let us know in the comments.

BMW Builds First Neue Klasse Pre-Production Prototypes In Hungary,https://insideevs.com/news/741832/neue-klasse-electric-suv-production/,The new plant in Debrecen will begin large-scale production of an iX3 replacement in 2025.,2024-11-21 08:46:14,"BMW is preparing to enter a new age of increasingly electrified vehicles, which is why it chose to resurrect the Neue Klasse moniker that originally designated a series of groundbreaking new models launched starting in 1962. Those models ended up defining BMW and shaping its image into what we know today, so the new Neue Klasse line, which will debut with an iX3 replacement in 2025, is seen as similarly pivotal for the company.
The automaker is erecting (or upgrading) factories around the world to build Neue Klasse vehicles, one of which is in Debrecen, Hungary. This brand-new plant has already started to build its first pre-production test vehicles, and it will soon begin to ramp up production, expecting to build the first customer vehicles in the latter part of next year.
But we don’t have to wait until then to see what the electric SUV codenamed NA5 will look like because its production body was fully revealed via leaked patent drawings. Autoweek published the images last week, and they show a vehicle that closely resembles the Vision Neue Klasse X, but it’s also considerably toned down and less aggressive.
Neue Klasse is the name of BMW’s new modular platform that will gradually phase out CLAR, the architecture used to underpin all the manufacturer's models from the 2 Series coupe to its largest offering, the X7. CLAR-based BMWs will remain in production until around the end of the decade, but the plan is for Neue Klasse to be used across the lineup.
We’re not completely sure Neue Klasse is an EV-only platform, though. BMW, like most other European automakers, has announced that it is pushing back the date when it goes pure-electric. BMW must have thought about at least making it possible to make range-extender EVs on the new platform, given that they seem to be rapidly growing in popularity. The company also has experience making EREVs after building the i3 Rex for several years.
More On This
Last year, BMW optimistically announced that it was going to achieve its goal of selling 50% EVs well before the self-imposed deadline of 2030. Now that seems unlikely, with EV sales not hitting predicted levels in most markets outside China, which is the only large market where electrification really seems to have taken off.
BMW is also investing $800 million to expand its plant in Mexico, which currently builds the CLAR-based 3 Series. The factory will begin building the same iX3-replacing electric SUV that just rolled off the production line in Hungary, but around two years later, in 2027. Additional Neue Klasse models will likely be produced in both factories in the next few years.
New generations of BMWs will also be built on the CLAR architecture, so the transition to Neue Klasse won’t be sudden. We’ve already seen spy photos of the next-generation combustion engine 3 Series codenamed G50, which will ride on an updated version of the platform that underpins the current model when it debuts around 2027. It will be sold alongside the pure-electric i3 previewed by the Vision Neue Klasse concept.",Andrei Nedelea
Honda Is Getting Closer To Making Solid-State Batteries,https://insideevs.com/news/741779/honda-solid-state-batteries-demonstration-facility/,"The automaker built a demonstration production line to figure out how to make affordable, high-density solid-state batteries for EVs and everything else.",2024-11-21 03:51:46,"All-solid-state batteries promise more driving range, faster charging speeds and potentially lower costs. They have been promised by battery manufacturers and automakers alike for at least a decade, but as it stands today, you still can’t walk into a showroom that sells electric vehicles and buy a car with a solid-state battery.
Small runs of prototype cells are already rolling off production lines across the world, but mass production is where things get complicated. That said, technology is moving at breakneck speed and several companies are promising we’ll be able to buy and drive an EV with solid-state batteries by the decade’s end.
One of those companies is Honda. The maker of the Prologue–which, admittedly, is made by General Motors–has built a life-size factory to demonstrate how it can manufacture all-solid-state batteries.
More Solid-State Battery Stories
With a floor area of nearly 300,000 square feet, the demo line is located on Honda’s property in Sakura City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. It has all the equipment needed to start the verification phase of each production process in preparation for the big leap.
That will happen sooner rather than later, which is excellent news. Honda says it will begin making actual batteries on this demo line in January 2025. However, these won’t make it into any EV; instead, these will be used to figure out what needs fixing before moving on to full-scale manufacturing in the following years.
Honda claims its first all-solid-state EVs will hit the market in the second half of the 2020s–that’s just one to four years away. The Japanese automaker’s might coincide with Stellantis’ plan to launch a demonstration fleet of Dodge Charger EVs with Factorial’s semi-solid-state batteries by 2026. Other companies like QuantumScape, Nissan and even Toyota are also working hard to bring solid-state batteries to mass production.
Honda’s approach to the potentially groundbreaking battery tech is to use conventional production processes that were originally designed for liquid lithium-ion batteries. However, the automaker’s research and development team adopted a roll-pressing technique which will help to achieve denser solid electrolyte layers. It also enables Honda to deploy continuous pressing rather than making solid electrolytes in smaller batches.
""The all-solid-state battery is an innovative technology that will be a game changer in this EV era,” said  Keiji Otsu, President and Representative Director of Honda R&D. “Replacing engines that have been supporting the advancements of automobiles to date, batteries will be the key factor of electrification. We believe that [the] advancement of batteries will be a driving force in the transformation of Honda. Now, the start of operation of our demonstration production line for our all-solid-state batteries is in sight, and we can say that we have reached an important milestone for Honda and the country of Japan.""
Honda’s EV plans in the United States have already started with GM’s help, and the Prologue is doing quite well here, but the long game includes several self-developed models part of a new line known as the Honda 0 Series. At least two new EVs will hit the streets starting in 2026, including an angular flagship sedan that was previewed by the rather lovely 0 Series Saloon Concept.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 9 Will Come With Tesla's NACS Plug,https://insideevs.com/news/741737/hyundai-ioniq-9-tesla-nacs/,"The three-row EV will work with Tesla Superchargers right out of the gate, with no adapter required.",2024-11-20 20:15:00,"Say hello to dongle-free Tesla Supercharging. The upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 9, revealed on Wednesday, will come from the factory with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug.
That means Ioniq 9 drivers will be able to visit Tesla's abundant and acclaimed charging stations without the need for a pesky adapter. The vast majority of other non-Tesla EVs, even ones that can technically access Superchargers now, use the Combined Charging System (CCS), which is quickly becoming the antiquated standard.
Owners of those EVs need to a CCS-to-NACS adapter if they want to charge at the thousands of Tesla Superchargers that blanket the country.
The Tesla NACS Transition
All major automakers have announced they're switching over to NACS and getting Supercharger access in return. Historically, only Teslas could access Superchargers, and that was a huge selling point for the brand. Tesla spent years building out the largest and, by many accounts, the most reliable and easy to use EV charging network.
Now other companies have inked deals to grant their EVs access to that walled garden. But those plans are moving slower than expected, and not every firm is at the same stage in the process. Ford, Rivian,  General Motors, Hyundai, Volvo and Polestar all have access to the network now. But so far, that's only been possible using adapters. Hyundai's 2025 Ioniq 5 crossover is the first non-Tesla EV to go on sale with a built-in NACS port, and it will hit dealerships later this year.
The Ioniq 9, a three-row bigger brother to the 5, will go on sale next spring. Of course, native NACS is a double-edged sword, given that the industry is still very much in-between standards. Owners may still have to use a dongle to plug in at non-Tesla stations.

Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles Of Range And A Tesla Plug,https://insideevs.com/news/741714/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row/,"We tour the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the latest entry into the growing world of electric family-haulers—and maybe the most enticing one yet.",2024-11-20 20:00:00,"If you’ve been hunting for an electric three-row SUV but never loved any of the choices available, you’re not alone. The Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X have their compromises, and while we love the Kia EV9, some variety would be nice too.
The situation is improving, thanks again to the Hyundai Motor Group. Following the home run it scored with the EV9, the Hyundai Ioniq 9 makes its debut as the newest and largest addition to its acclaimed Ioniq family of EVs.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
The Ioniq 9 builds on what makes its smaller siblings great: long ranges, fast charging and head-turning design. It’s just all in a bigger package that, for better or worse, American families increasingly crave.
And it's more than just a re-badged and re-bodied EV9 this time. It beats the EV9 on range and even comes with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug right out of the gate, so it'll be ready to use the thousands of Supercharger stations out there on the next family road trip.
First came the Ioniq 5 as a compact crossover aimed at the Tesla Model Y. Then Hyundai launched the Ioniq 6, a streamlined sedan with epic efficiency and range. Hyundai’s third U.S.-market EV on its modern E-GMP platform is the Ioniq 9. It offers up to seven seats and is an electric alternative to the Hyundai Palisade.
It’s part of Hyundai’s plan to have a lineup of 23 electric models by 2030. It goes into production this coming spring at Hyundai’s Georgia plant, so the automaker expects it to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, which requires vehicles to be assembled in North America. (That is, if that policy still exists when the vehicle goes on sale.)
Hyundai hasn’t announced pricing yet, only saying it will be “competitive.” Given that the EV9 starts at around $55,000, somewhere around there is probably a good guess. It’ll cost a lot more than a Palisade or Santa Fe, I can tell you that much.
Hyundai is targeting an Environmental Protection Agency range rating of up to 335 miles, which is well above average and sure to dampen some buyers’ range anxiety. Even more impressively, the brand says that no matter what Ioniq 9 trim you buy, it’ll be rated for at least 300 miles. The same can’t be said of its cousin, the EV9, which is good for anywhere from 230 to 304 miles, depending on the trim.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
Much of that has to do with the Ioniq 9’s 110.3 kilowatt-hour, nickel-cobalt-manganese battery, which is about 10% larger than the largest pack available in the EV9. Long range and super-fast charging is a winning combination, and that’s just what the Ioniq 9 serves up. Hyundai says the 9 will be able to recharge from 10%-80% in 24 minutes on a sufficiently powerful plug, thanks to its 800-volt architecture. And it comes from the factory with Tesla’s NACS plug design. So owners will be able to plug in at some 17,000 Tesla Superchargers without needing to use an adapter.
The NACS Rollout
Every major automaker is switching over to NACS from the Combined Charging System, the current standard, but Hyundai is ahead of the curve. Other automakers are still putting out new or updated models with the old charging port, necessitating the use of a dongle at Superchargers.
There will be three powertrain options on offer. The Long-Range RWD is the range champion, while the Performance AWD is the quickest. The AWD Long Range fits in the middle.
Here’s how they break down:
At first glance, the Ioniq 9 gives off minivan vibes. I mean this in a good way; the 9 lacks the standard upright boxiness of other big SUVs and that gives it a striking presence. Its short hood, steep windshield and curving roofline give it a sleek, unique look. Just like on other Ioniq models, the exterior is dotted with hundreds of little squares, or “pixels,” that tie together the otherwise disparate-looking EVs.
And a stretched-out wheelbase—the longest of any Hyundai model—creates plenty of room to stretch out inside. Of course, as a three-row SUV, the Ioniq 9’s main selling point is how much stuff and people you can fit inside.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
The Ioniq 9’s cabin does indeed feel huge, as I learned when I got a preview of the model earlier this month. It has a flat floor throughout, which frees up room for your feet, particularly in the middle seat. The second row is downright cavernous and can be optioned with either a three-seat bench or reclining captain’s chairs. The third row is totally usable, even for adults. When I crawled back there, I didn’t feel cramped in the legroom or headroom departments.
The Kia EV9
One fun touch up front is the addition of a sliding center console. So when you want extra room between the front seats for a purse or something, you can slide the unit backward. When you need more room in the rear, you can shift it forward. A similar feature is also available in the Ioniq 5.
Up front, the 9 offers high-output, 100-watt USB-C ports that get their power straight from the high-voltage battery. That’s in addition to vehicle-to-load, or V2L, a feature that lets owners use the Ioniq 9 as a mobile battery pack to power practically anything.
The Ioniq 9 has the same dual-screen setup that’s shared with other Kia and Hyundai EVs. In this one, though, it’s curved rather than flat, which is a nice touch. Both the driver-facing cluster and the main screen come in at 12 inches. And the system can handle over-the-air software updates, just like previous models.
2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9
What’s new here is something called “Features on Demand,” an in-vehicle store where owners can buy “digital upgrades” for their cars. It’s debuting with a few options: some lighting signatures for opening or closing the doors, new themes for the displays, and streaming services like Amazon Music and Soundcloud.
Don’t worry—Hyundai says paying to activate one's heated seats is off the table.
2024 Kia EV9
We won’t know for sure until we can get the Ioniq 9 out on the road and spend some quality time with it. But it’s mostly a question of design preference. These two SUVs share a platform, they’re both big and spacious, and their user interfaces will feel similar too. The Ioniq 9 has the firm edge on range, though, which may be the deciding factor for some folks. And we know that the EV9 will soon pack the NACS port as well, along with an adapter for the existing cars.
At the end of the day, it’s just great to see another solid electric option for bigger families.

Jaguar Follows Up Controversial Ad With Controversial EV,https://insideevs.com/news/741742/jaguar-preview-new-ev-miami/,Jaguar's new EV is as avant-garde as its controversial rebranding and ad campaign. But all that hate may be misplaced.,2024-11-20 16:24:26,"It seems like the fruits of Jaguar’s new rebrand may just pay off.
Hot on the heels of a controversial advertisement and announcement of new logos and typeface, the storied British sports car and sedan brand has shown off a cryptic look at its first model in an EV future, with an announcement that we’ll soon learn more on Dec. 2 in Miami.
The teaser doesn’t show a lot, but we can ascertain a surprisingly high amount of information from what appears to be a cropped dead-on rear photo of an aqua-colored car against a bright pink background. The mystery Jaguar is very wide, appearing to have a sports car-like width that houses the car’s wide tires. The car’s lines are interestingly rectilinear, a dramatic change from the organic flowing shapes of Jaguar’s now-discontinued ICE and EV models.
What few curves there are in the car’s haunches are offset by the car’s straight line and simplistic cutouts for what could be a rear grille or rear window. Whatever the case, it’s certainly a huge departure from whatever Jaguar was doing before today.
Jaguar Commercial Screenshot
For those not in the know, Jaguar just previewed a provocative new advertising campaign that signaled a relaunch and rebranding of the classic British brand. It featured a high-contrast color palette, along with young high-fashion models in androgynous garments that feel reminiscent of designs from the late, great Alexander McQueen. The advertisement didn’t show a car or a timeline—just a tagline that said “copy nothing,"" which is actually a callback to a famous saying from Jaguar's founder.
The campaign felt as if Jaguar had somehow become a fashion brand under LVMH selling skincare or handbags rather than cars.
The ad’s reception has been pretty controversial. Some have praised Jaguar for taking a chance and attempting to set itself apart in a premium EV world, while others think the company should have focused on introducing a car—especially since Jaguar is killing its entire lineup of vehicles (including its lone EV) until its new models are introduced.
But the ad's inclusion of diverse faces and bodies has put Jaguar right in the crosshairs of the culture wars. Fox News called it ""Bud Light 2.0"" On X, the social media network owned by Elon Musk with an algorithm now keenly dialed in to reflect his politics, some have insisted that Jaguar’s ad is a symptom of everything wrong with society, that the mere presence of models in dresses means that Jaguar is done for.
Those seem like strange critiques to anyone who has paid any attention to the fashion industry. Jaguar's new direction feels pretty much in line with any luxury fashion house marketing campaign from any point in time from 2021 onward. That's clearly the vibe Jaguar is going for now, and probably must, since the cars are slated to cost at least $120,000.
A lot of the hate comments tend to revolve around a bygone era of Jaguar, one that they think catered to ""rich men"" intrested in the old-style, stodgy designs like the pre-2010 Jaguar XJ. But those designs, that marketing—it just wasn't working. In 2023, Jaguar sold a whopping 8,438 cars. By comparison, Genesis sold 68,798 vehicles that same year. Clearly, Jaguar was in bad need of a shake-up.
Whatever you feel, you can’t deny that it certainly got people talking about Jaguar in ways that its old cars never, ever did. Searches for Jaguar are up dramatically since it pulled this marketing stunt. Maybe Jaguar knows something we don’t, and it’ll pay off in the long run.
Jaguar’s next vehicle, which is likely a concept car, will be unveiled in early December. Is Jaguar's new direction misguided? Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

Zeekr 7x Crossover Spotted Testing In Europe Before Debut,https://insideevs.com/news/741726/zeekr-7x-europe-china-testing/,This BMW X3-sized EV will likely end up on European roads before the end of next year.,2024-11-20 16:00:19,"Geely, Zeekr, the EU, and China are all hot-button topics right now, as each entity goes through its own tumultuous re-organization to protect its own interests. Geely has merged Zeekr and Lynk & Co back into one entity (sort of), while the EU demands a technology transfer from China if it wants to establish more European roots. Nevertheless, the wheels of progress keep turning, right? The Sino-Swedish brand Zeekr is continuing its quest for growth in markets outside of China by growing its model lineup. According to new photos, the 7x luxury compact crossover is next on the docket for European expansion.
Photographed in the midst of validation testing, this all-black crossover looks pretty much identical to the version already on sale in China. There are a few differences. For example, the wheels on this test unit are different from the ones found on the Zeekr 7x on Chinese roads. Also, this unit appears to be missing the customizable light-up Stargate panel that we’ve seen on the Zeekr 007. To be fair, it is optional on Chinese models.
Remember, the Zeekr 7x uses the same SEA platform that’s underpinning a plethora of new EVs made by Geely and its associated brands. This means the 7x effectively is a mechanical sibling to the Polestar 4, Zeekr 001, Zeekr 007, and a gaggle of new Smart-branded EVs that thus far only exist in Europe and China.
However, it appears that the 7x tends to favor the 007 out of all of them. Upon launch, the 7x got the same 800-volt architecture as the 007, unlike the older 400-volt architecture that underpins the Polestar 4 and export versions of the Zeekr 001. When coupled with Zeekr’s 75 kWh Golden Battery, the brand claims it can sprint from 10-80% in under 11 minutes.
Now, there’s no news as to what changes the 7x will have before it enters the European market. But, if it does keep the 800-volt architecture and 75 kWh LFP battery, the 7x could end up being one of the fastest-charging vehicles on sale in Europe.
Of course, we don’t know what price the 7x will take. In China, the 7x significantly undercuts EV crossovers from brands like BMW, which costs only about $31,000 for a base single-motor 7x. However, imported Zeekrs are subject to an additional 19.9% tariff (not including the 10% already added in), which naturally will raise the price. Also, it’s not uncommon for Chinese manufacturers to raise the price for export markets. The Zeekr X (mechanical twin to the Volvo EX30) starts at about $45,000 USD, significantly more than the roughly $23,000 an equivalent version would cost in China. The 7x is likely to be somewhat more expensive than the subcompact Zeekr X.
The Zeekr 7x will likely go on sale in Europe before the end of next year.

"2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 Gets Tesla NACS Port Up Front, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741700/2026-genesis-electrified-gv70/,"The charging port is located at the front of the SUV, just like before, but now it’s motorized and heated.",2024-11-20 15:00:00,"The Genesis Electrified GV70 doesn't get as much attention as some of the Hyundai Motor Group's other electric models, but it's always impressed us with its combination of style, performance and comfort. Now, a lot more people might notice it soon, as it's found at Tesla Supercharger stations.
This is the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. It’s not a completely new model but rather a subtle facelift that also brings a couple of notable changes under the skin. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a native NACS charging port at the front of the EV. The location of the port isn’t new–the outgoing model’s CCS1 port was also at the front–but the native NACS is new and makes the Electrified GV70 the first EV in the Genesis lineup to come with one from the factory.
2026 Genesis GV70 Electrified Tesla NACS
As a reminder, NACS means North American Charging Standard. It’s Tesla’s invention and it means the 2026 Electrified GV70 will be able to recharge at Tesla Superchargers in North America without using a charging adapter. However, Genesis said customers will get an NACS to CCS adapter to top up their EVs at CCS DC fast chargers. Combined, there are over 36,000 NACS and CCS DC fast chargers in the United States, so going on long road trips shouldn’t be a daunting experience anymore.
More Genesis Stuff (Not The Band)
Besides switching from CCS to NACS, Genesis added a motor to the charging port door (it previously used a manual release), as well as a heating element to the charging port to help with de-icing during cold months. There’s also new lighting to make it easier to see what you’re doing while parked in dark places.
The second notable change is a bigger battery under the floor. The outgoing model had a 77.4-kilowatt-hour pack that enabled an EPA-estimated range of 236 miles on a full charge. The 2026 model comes with a larger 84 kWh battery that should provide a longer driving range, but there’s no official rating yet. Power remains unchanged, with a dual-motor setup good for 429 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.
Several design changes have been made, including a redesigned G-Matrix Crest Grille and multi-lens array (MLA) headlamps. There’s also a refreshed skid plate design and new 19- and 21-inch wheels. Inside, there’s an all-new 27-inch OLED display that integrates both the instrument cluster and infotainment.
The facelifted Electrified GV70 now responds quicker and better to voice commands, according to the Korean automaker. There are also improved over-the-air update capabilities, but we don’t know what that means, exactly.
The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 is manufactured in South Korea but Hyundai Motor Group’s plant in Alabama is responsible for the final assembly. Genesis says the EV is “dual-sourced at the brand’s production facilities in Montgomery, Alabama and Ulsan, Korea.”
The refreshed all-electric SUV will arrive at North American retailers in the first half of 2025. Pricing details are yet to be determined, but we’ll know more when Genesis starts taking orders next year. The current model starts at $68,300 including destination. We expect the refreshed model to be similar in price.",Iulian Dnistran
The Audi Q8 E-Tron Will Be Axed Early And Its Factory Will Close,https://insideevs.com/news/741718/audi-brussels-factory-close-february/,"China’s Nio was reportedly interested in acquiring the Audi Brussels factory, but the deal was never confirmed.",2024-11-20 14:00:18,"We’ve known for months about the troubles Audi has been having with its Brussels plant that today only builds the Q8 E-Tron. Rumors that the automaker was considering ending production of the electric SUV early, essentially stopping all work at the facility. This made its 3,000 workers uneasy, and many gathered outside in protest, even setting tires alight to attract attention and make the extent of their worries clear.
Angry protesters reportedly broke into the facility last Wednesday and tried to enter the meeting room where union representatives were in talks with factory officials regarding its future. The police were called to remove the protester and try and instill calm, but it apparently degenerated into violence, according to EuroNews.
More On This
Audi tried to find a buyer for the factory, and China’s Nio, which Audi had a naming dispute with in the past, was reportedly interested in taking it over, but that deal was never confirmed by either party, and nothing materialized. Now Automotive News says Audi has officially ended the search for a buyer, which likely means the plant will shut its doors in a few months.
That will probably happen when production of the Q8 E-Tron, which hasn’t been as big a hit as Audi was hoping, stops at the end of February next year. The reasons behind the Q8 E-Tron’s failure are complex and are a mix of falling EV demand in key markets, the arrival of increasingly talented rivals from China, and the fact that it’s just a revamp of the original Audi E-Tron SUV launched in 2018, which feels like an eternity ago given the rate of progress of EVs globally.
The Brussels plant could be Volkswagen’s first factory to shut its doors, but two more could follow, along with tens of thousands of job cuts across Europe and a 10% salary cut for the employees that will stay. This is from another EuroNews report that quoted Volkswagen’s General Works Council Chairwoman Daniela Cavallo as saying, ""All German VW plants are affected by this. None of them are safe.""
Audi parent Volkswagen says it was not expecting post-pandemic demand to be so weak, and it was caught with too much production capacity. Reuters says strikes are expected at all of VW’s European plants starting next month and it all depends on what deals the unions will be able to negotiate with the automaker.
The workers’ union is proposing that no factories close but they are willing to accept concessions like forgoing bonuses in 2025 and 2026 that could yield €1.5 ($1.58) billion in savings, and it says it plans to take the automaker to court if it proceeds with the planned plant closures. This means there is still a chance Volkswagen (and Audi) will keep its overproducing factories open, but it will definitely close them if this poses a threat to its very existence (which isn’t the case yet since its finances aren't in the red).",Andrei Nedelea
Electric Mini Cooper And Aceman U.S. Launch Is Up In The Air,https://insideevs.com/news/741709/mini-cooper-se-aceman-delayed/,"The new electric Mini hatch and the high-riding Aceman were slated to arrive in the U.S. in 2026, but now that may not happen at all.",2024-11-20 13:00:49,"The high import tariff on electric vehicles made in China, which in the U.S. is now up to 100%, has made many manufacturers reconsider their strategy and reassess their plans to expand their lineups. Mini, for instance, decided against importing the new electric Cooper hatchback, which is currently exclusively made in China, saying that it would bring it over once parallel production started in the U.K. at Mini’s Oxford plant.
This pushed the Stateside launch of the Cooper EV back by two years, but according to a new report published by Road&Track with information from Motoring File, that plan may have fallen through. The same goes for the Aceman, which is the Cooper’s crossover equivalent, that’s also built in the same Great Wall Motor factory in China and whose U.S. debut was also planned for 2026.
The launch of the Cooper and Aceman EVs has now been put on hold until further notice, and it may not happen at all. Mini is still going to import the Countryman EV into North America, but there’s a chance that could be its only electric model. It will continue to offer the gas-burning Cooper hatch and convertible, both of which are manufactured in Oxford and aren’t subject to import duties, although that might change under the presidency of Donald Trump, which may impose a 10% tariff on imports from Europe.
The 100% tariff is also the main reason why Volvo delayed launching the China-made EX30 in the States. It’s now expected to arrive in the States next year once production begins at Volvo’s plant in Belgium.

Considering it’s underpinned by the same platform as the Ora Cat (albeit with a superior independent rear suspension setup), it felt great, although not as fun as the previous Cooper SE. It has much bigger batteries, though, so it has a lot more range, making it a much more usable EV and expanding its breadth of talents.
Considering EV buyers seem to be increasingly looking at high-riding crossovers rather than the traditional hatchback, sedan and wagon body styles, perhaps the new electric Countryman is the only EV that Mini really needs in its U.S. lineup. When we sampled the Countryman SE at its launch event in Portugal in March, we found a lot to like, and we thought the EV variant was a better choice than any of the versions that still use fuel.",Andrei Nedelea
