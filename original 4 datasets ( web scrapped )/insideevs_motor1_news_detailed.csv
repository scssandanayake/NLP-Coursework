The Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Is So Much Car: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/745373/2024-porsche-cayenne-turbo-e-hybrid-coupe-review/,"Tons of power, tons of weight, tons of money.",2024-12-25 08:49:28,"Nothing inspires mixed emotions quite like a performance plug-in hybrid. At first, it seems like a perfect middle ground between gas and electric. There’s smooth, emissions-free driving for running around town, big range and quick refueling for long trips, and huge performance when you let the engine and motor work in tandem.
The new Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid does offer all that. But, it’s not quite as simple as having your cake and eating it too.
Porsche facelifted the third-generation Cayenne for the 2024 model year, and the changes are extensive. For the plug-in hybrid models, the battery capacity increases from 14.1 kilowatt-hours to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, which brings a big bump in electric range. The motor also gets an increase from 134 to 174 horsepower, and combined with a revised twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid produces a ripping 729 hp and 700 lb-ft of torque. That’s more than the old Turbo S E-Hybrid. More than any combustion SUV out there now, save the mechanically similar Lamborghini Urus SE.
But there is a price to pay for this blending of combustion and electricity—and not just the steep $158,995 base price of the 2025 model (our tester was a 2024). Porsche quotes a curb weight of 5,719 pounds for this Turbo E-Hybrid Coupe. The Cayenne GTS Coupe, which uses the same V-8 without the hybrid system, weighs nearly 700 pounds less.
The whole thing is a little absurd. Not just the weight figure on its own, I mean the whole thing. A luxury SUV that nods toward efficiency and the need to reduce our environmental impact but also has a twin-turbo V-8 and weighs as much as two original Boxsters. It’s just so much car.
The weight dominates everything. Admittedly, this Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid coupe handles its weight as well as it can, thanks to the optional rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll systems. It’s freakishly agile and body roll is kept to an absolute minimum when you put it into Sport Plus mode, where the car lowers on its air springs and stiffens up its adaptive dampers. Through corners, this Cayenne doesn’t feel its weight whatsoever.
Steering is precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, but surprisingly light. And below 50 miles per hour, when the rear wheels are calibrated to turn in the opposite direction of the fronts, there’s this slightly unnatural sense of the car castering around that takes a bit to get used to.
Porsche revised the springs and dampers for all facelifted Cayenne models, and here, they provide an uncanny-good spread of soft, cushion-y ride quality and sport-sedan-like handling. Even on the optional 22-inch wheels, big bumps barely make a blip. Basically, it rides and handles in a way that is entirely divorced from its huge weight and tall ride height.
Still, you’re always conscious of the weight under braking. Even slowing down at low speeds for a stop sign, you can feel all that mass shifting around beneath you. It never feels quite right. Also not helping matters is the fact that the braking is inconsistent. It’s always a challenge to blend regenerative braking from the motor and friction braking, especially when you have carbon-ceramic rotors, as our tester does.
Coming to a complete stop around town, you always end up getting a bit more braking than you want. The motor drives through the Cayenne’s eight-speed automatic, so when you’re coming to a stop, the car has to balance motor regeneration with downshifts. You don’t feel the shifts, but the sensation is similar to aggressive engine braking. Trying to be perfectly smooth rolling to an intersection is a real challenge.
Occasionally the hybrid system hiccups when getting up to speed too, but once you’re going, it’s all very smooth. The engine cuts in and out seamlessly, and the motor is always ready to deliver a wallop of torque.
It’s silly quick, unsurprisingly. The electric motor and engine combine to make the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid feel like it’s got a supercharged Chevy V-8 under the hood. You go to pass someone on the highway, and the eight-speed auto downshifts a gear, maybe two, before an endless surge of power. Get on it hard from a low gear, and it’s even more eye-opening. Performance like this was not long ago exclusive to upper-echelon 911s.
This might be heretical to say, but it sounds better than a lot of new 911s, too. As part of the Lightweight Sports Package—a laughable line item for a 5,700-pound car—you get a center-exit sports exhaust, and it’s raucous. Even in its quiet modes, there’s an ever-present burble from the V-8 and a muscle-car thunder with the valves fully open. It’s childish and totally addictive.
Still, the harder you get on it, the more fuel you’re going to burn. Which is, of course, obvious, and normally not a concern in a hi-po SUV. But in a little over a week with the car, I couldn’t stop thinking about fuel economy. I imagined a guilt-free yet powerful V-8 experience, and while the hybrid system can decrease fuel consumption, it doesn’t turn this Porsche into a Prius.
As with all plug-in hybrids, you have to charge it often. Updated Cayenne hybrids get an 11-kilowatt on-board AC charger, so if you have the right setup at home, you should be able to get a full battery in around two and a half hours. And the range is excellent. The EPA says it’ll do 24 miles on a charge, but I regularly saw figures closer to 40 miles.
If you’re driving around town slowly, you’ll get great fuel economy. Hell, you can leave the Cayenne in E-Power mode and the V-8 will never even turn on until you get on the throttle hard. Longer trips at higher speeds are a mixed bag, though. I drove the car 200 miles and back mostly on the highway, but with about 20 miles of slow New York City traffic. With a full battery, I managed nearly 27 mpg compared to 22 mpg with around a quarter of a battery. It’s not nothing! But, it’s still conspicuous consumption.
Ultimately, you’re left with something that's the best of both worlds, and the worst of both worlds. Under the right circumstances, you can get a big efficiency benefit from the hybrid system, but at other times, it’s a lot of extra weight to carry around.
Philosophically, the base Cayenne E-Hybrid and Cayenne S E-Hybrid probably make more sense, pairing a lighter, more efficient V-6 with the same battery and motor. But, the performance and speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick personality typical of a Porsche Turbo is undeniable. I like this thing a lot, even though I also find it totally ridiculous and suspect that it’s likely not quite as satisfying as a pure gas car, or a full EV.
And this being a review of a Porsche, we can’t end before talking about the price. It is so damned expensive. Notably, the base price between this 2024 test car and the equivalent 2025 model jumped from $153,050 to $163,945. The as-tested price of this one rises from $191,230 to just under $200,000. You can skip a lot of the options our tester has, like the $9,070 carbon-ceramic brakes and the $10,700 Lightweight Sport Package (though it is the only way to get these amazing houndstooth seats). Still, it’s a very expensive car no matter how you slice it.
I suppose it’s natural for a complicated car to engender complicated feelings. Some moments, you love it. Others, you’re baffled by it. And often, you’re left astonished by just how silly it is. I sort of want one, and I’m slightly disturbed by that notion.
Like I said earlier, mixed emotions.

Production Of Fiat And Maserati EVs Will Stay Paused Over Slow Sales,https://www.motor1.com/news/745181/stellantis-pauses-maserati-fiat-production-again/,"Stellantis is extending the Fiat 500e production stoppage until January 20, while Maserati EV production is paused until February 3.",2024-12-25 08:49:29,"Fiat won’t be building any new 500es anytime soon. Stellantis has extended the shutdown at the factory where it assembles the little electric vehicle until January 20. The automaker had announced late last month that it would pause production at its Mirafiori factory in Italy until January 5.
The new extended shutdown also includes the Maserati GranTurismo and GrabCabrio that Stellantis also builds at the plant. However, according to the Reuters report, the automaker won’t restart producing those two models until February 3.
Stellantis has paused production at the factory before, including twice late last year in September and again in October. Electric vehicles just aren't selling as well as automakers had planned, and automakers are now curtailing EV production while reconsidering their electrification efforts.
CEO Carlos Tavares had previously blamed bad marketing for Maserati’s woes, but Stellantis has since parted ways with the CEO. There was disagreement between Tavares and the board about the automaker’s direction, leading to his sudden resignation at the beginning of the month.
Interestingly, abysmal EV sales have been a boon for consumers looking for cheap leases. Falling demand is leaving dealers with a lot of inventory they’re eager to move. One dealer in Colorado is currently offering a $0-a-month lease on the new 500e, leaning generous federal and state incentives to give consumers excellent deals.

Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,2024-12-25 08:49:30,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

Porsche Is Struggling With Electric 718 Boxster Development: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/744790/porsche-718-electric-development-problems/,Battery issues could delay the next Cayman as well.,2024-12-25 08:49:30,"Already discontinued in Europe because of cybersecurity regulations, the current-generation Porsche 718 is not long for this world. The gasoline-fueled Boxster and Cayman duo will be discontinued globally by next year. What comes after? An all-electric sports car. However, there's reportedly a possibility of a gap between when the ICE dies and when the EV indirectly takes its place in the lineup.
Automobilwoche, the German branch of Automotive News Europe, claims Porsche is having problems developing the 718 EV. The engineers from Zuffenhausen are apparently ""well behind schedule,"" so there's a real risk the electric sports car's launch could be delayed. The mid-mounted battery is believed to be the culprit, with Porsche ""constantly requesting adjustments"" from supplier Valmet Automotive.
The Finnish company is doing as asked, but it's incurring additional costs that Porsche allegedly doesn't want to pay or only partially covers. Based on our oldest spy shots, the electric 718 has been undergoing testing for at least two years. Nevertheless, it's increasingly likely that the Boxster and Cayman without a combustion engine will not be ready for primetime in 2025 to supersede the gas cars swiftly.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg. According to Automobilwoche, the next-gen, electric-only Cayenne could also be delayed from its original programmed debut in 2026. Porsche has already stopped chasing its lofty goal of having EVs account for 80% of annual sales by 2030. In addition, the German luxury brand has pledged to keep the V-8 engine well into the next decade.
The report mentions that the Panamera could get a next-generation model with combustion engines, given the company's current slowdown in electric sales. Taycan deliveries were down 50% globally through September. On a more positive note, the 911 is said to continue with gas engines into the 2030s. On numerous occasions, Porsche has said the 911 will be its final ICE car.
Elsewhere, the large electric SUV known internally as the ""K1"" could be pushed back by a few years. Alternatively, Porsche is reportedly considering extending the Cayenne's platform for a three-row SUV with gas engines since the Volkswagen Group Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) doesn't support conventional powertrains. Last month, the Chief Financial Officer, Lutz Meschke, admitted that future models that were supposed to be electric-only could get gas engines:
""We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""
Porsche is in a delicate situation. The next-gen Macan was supposed to be released about two years ago, but software glitches prevented the electric crossover from being released on time. It's now finally out. To make matters worse, the ICE version—which has always been among the firm's top sellers—will be phased out worldwide in 2026. It has already been axed in Europe due to the same cybersecurity regulations that killed the 718.
As if that wasn't bad enough, demand in China has collapsed this year, with deliveries falling by nearly 30% in the first nine months.
We've reached out for a comment from Porsche. The article will be updated if we hear back.

BMW Built An All-Electric M2 Prototype,https://www.motor1.com/news/744902/bmw-m2-ev-prototype/,A small team of engineers has been working on this car since 2018.,2024-12-25 08:49:31,"BMW's M division is going electric. Last week the company teased an all-electric version of its iconic M3, set to hit showrooms in 2027. Now, the company is showing off another all-electric M car: A prototype based on the first-generation M2 coupe.
The car, internally called The Beast, was conceived by a small group of engineers in 2018 on a ""mission to explore what's possible,"" according to Michael Sailer, one of the team's dynamics engineers.
The car looks fairly stock on the outside, save for a couple of tow hooks, a ducktail trunk spoiler, and a set of gold-painted brake calipers—likely carbon-ceramics. The cabin has been stripped to accommodate a roll cage, a racing seat, and a suite of testing equipment.
BMW did not go into detail on the M2 prototype's powertrain, but it's clear the factory turbocharged straight-six has been replaced by some kind of electric power. Seeing as how every electric M car will have four motors, this M2 may be rocking a quad-motor setup itself. But that's just speculation.
Engineers describe the battery-powered M2 prototype as hard to control. M boss Frank Van Meel compares it to the F10-generation M5, which sent power to the rear wheels only, making it a relative handful considering its twin-turbo V-8 power. It forced the team to turn to AWD for the next-generation car.
""I can still remember January 2015, Cobo Hall, Detroit Motor Show, where I said in an interview, the next M5 generation will need four-wheel drive,"" he said. ""And everyone was going 'this is the end of the universe,' because if you put four-wheel drive on an M car it will only go straight forward, there will be no dynamics left.""
Van Meel said he had to ""live with this shit-storm"" for three years until the first all-wheel drive M5 came out, then everyone drove it and loved it. He likens the transition to electric power to the transition from rear-wheel drive to all-wheel drive.
""Trust me, that what we're working on now for the future will be at least as great as what we did [with the first AWD M5],"" he said. ""Now we will make that beast controllable, so that the next step in high performance is on the horizon.""

"Tavares: China Is 'Many Years' Ahead With EVs, Says EU Politicians Created 'Dead End'",https://www.motor1.com/news/744740/tavares-resignation-amicable-blames-eu-politicians/,"The Ex-Stellantis CEO believes China is years ahead when it comes to EVs, hence his push for company goals many said were unrealistic.",2024-12-25 08:49:31,"Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares isn't backing down from the decisions that led to his resignation. In his first interview since voluntarily exiting the company, he effectively double-downed on his stance that conflicted with the Stellantis board members. At the same time, he voiced concerns that China was far ahead in the electric fold, essentially forcing European brands into survival mode.
Speaking with Portuguese news outlet Expresso, the ex-executive emphasized the importance of having a strong, singular vision and admitted his plan didn't mesh with the board.
""A company that has 250,000 employees and 15 brands cannot be managed with a lack of alignment,” said Tavares, according to Expresso. That was the catalyst for his resignation, which Tavares described as an ""amicable"" joint decision between him and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. And it seems he has no regrets, as Wards Auto reports he would make the same calls if it all came about again.
His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

It Begins: Honda And Nissan Reportedly Starting Merger Talks,https://www.motor1.com/news/744769/honda-nissan-merger-talks-rumor/,The two will allegedly operate under a new holding company.,2024-12-25 08:49:32,"Nissan and Honda are reportedly about to begin talks of merging. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, which cites no specific sources, the two will operate under a new holding company, with the specific details to be decided later. The new group will also allegedly look to include Mitsubishi in the future.
Nissan and Honda began working together in March 2024, expanding their partnership in August to include Mitsubishi as the three agreed to develop electric vehicles and software jointly. Nissan owns a 24 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
Neither Nissan nor Honda would confirm the report's allegations to Reuters, telling the publication that the two are ""exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths.""
And Nissan certainly needs the help.
This year has not been kind to the Japanese automaker, with the company cutting production of its best-selling vehicle while asking dealers to sell cars at a loss. Late last month, two unnamed executives told the Financial Times that the company only had 12 to 14 months to survive. Nissan recently tapped former Jeep CEO Christian Meunier to serve as chairman of Nissan America.
The automotive industry is facing unprecedented challenges. There's more competition, more change, and less certainty than ever before. Chinese automakers are edging out Western brands in their home market, with some beginning to see real sales gains in Europe and elsewhere. Electrification is another considerable point of disruption, where the industry is chasing Chinese progress, forcing traditional automakers to get creative to stay competitive.

Lamborghini Is Delaying Its First EV Like Everyone Else,https://www.motor1.com/news/744579/lamborghini-delays-first-ev-2029/,The production-ready Lanzador will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028.,2024-12-25 08:49:32,"Several automakers within the last year have altered their electrification plans. Slowing growth is forcing companies like Volvo, Bentley, Ford, and others to reconsider their strategies and rejigger their launch schedules, including Lamborghini. The Italian company now plans to delay the launch of its first EV by a year, according to the CEO.
Lamborghini boss Stephan Winkelmann told reporters this week that the EV will arrive in 2029 instead of 2028, according to Reuters. Winkelmann said he did not believe 2029 was too late to launch an EV, adding that the company does not think the segment will be ready for EVs by 2026.
The automaker is also waiting for potential changes to the European Union’s combustion engine ban set for 2035, when a review takes place in 2026. Lamborghini has also expressed interest in the potential for synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines in new vehicles.
""We think this is the right way to face the future,"" Winkelmann said. ""There are discussions around synthetic fuels and this is an opportunity for our kind of cars"".
The automaker’s first EVs won’t be a supercar. Instead, it’ll be a four-seat grand tourer previewed by the Lanzador concept in 2023. Winkelmann said earlier this year that electric supercars weren’t selling well, and might never truly entice consumers.

"The $0-A-Month Fiat 500e Lease Deal Is Real, But There’s A Catch",https://www.motor1.com/news/744351/2024-fiat-500e-free-lease/,"All you have to pay are the taxes and fees, which total $62 a month over the 27-month lease.",2024-12-25 08:49:33,"Electric vehicles aren’t selling as well as automakers had hoped. Interest seems to be waning, and the growth rate is slowing, forcing dealers to offer some impressive incentives to move the product. The Larry H. Miller Chrysler Dodge Ram Fiat dealership in Aurora, Colorado, is one such outfit, offering the 2024 Fiat 500e for $0 down and $0 a month for 27 months.
While the advertisement says $0 a month, the lease isn’t completely free. The fine print spells out the true cost. Lessees will still need to pay taxes and fees totaling $1,693—$1,297.68 in estimated taxes and a $350 disposition fee. That comes out to just $62.69 a month, with state and federal incentives and rebates covering the actual upfront costs of the lease that go to the dealer. The feds have $7,500 to offer, while Colorado adds another $5,000 to the pot to bring costs down.
In a sea of new EVs, the 500e is odd. It has a 42-kilowatt-hour battery offering up to 149 miles of range on a single charge, with its front-mounted single motor providing propulsion. It’s also not cheap if you decide to purchase outright, with a starting price of $34,095 (including the $1,595 destination charge) before any incentives. The hatchback's small size and limited range make it perfect for urban driving, but also limits its audience.
Fiat has been struggling to sell the EV since its launch, most recently having to pause production at its Mirafiori, Italy, factory where it builds the 500e. The pause started at the end of last month, and the automaker appears to have extended the shutdown another two weeks until January 20, according to a new Reuters report.
The lease deal ends December 31, and it’s only available to Colorado residents. Lessees will have the option to purchase the EV for $17,388 once the lease expires.

Mercedes-AMG Shows Its Electric Performance SUV For The First Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/744219/mercedes-amg-performance-suv-prototype-testing/,"The speedy SUV will have over 1,000 horsepower.",2024-12-25 08:49:33,"Mercedes-AMG is building two standalone performance vehicles: A high-powered SUV and a four-door coupe. The duo will use the brand's new AMG.EA architecture, and for better or worse, they'll both be electric. Today, we get our first official glimpse of the SUV in action, undergoing cold-weather testing in Sweden. And it looks… interesting.
Previewed earlier this year in a silhouette sketch, this is the first time anyone has seen the Mercedes-AMG SUV prototype on the road. Under all that camouflage the SUV has a four-door coupe-like design with a sharp front end and sleek bodywork. It will be similar in size to the current GLS, but best of all, it won't look anything like the current crop of Mercedes EQ products.
Details on the powertrain are still scarce, but we expect this SUV to be plenty powerful, and hopefully, equally as efficient. Mercedes has confirmed that the SUV will use axial flux motors and a new high-performance battery pack offering a 40-percent boost in energy density. That will yield an output of over 1,000 horsepower.
The current Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV is currently the most powerful AMG EV in the lineup. It has a 90.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 617 horsepower and 701 pound-feet of torque, which sends it to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds. This new SUV should be significantly brawnier.
Mercedes-AMG also released images of the four-door coupe undergoing testing in the snow, which we saw earlier this year. The electric sedan will replace the current AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, and use the same disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors as the SUV with an ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight.""
Expect to see both models in the metal sometime early in 2025.

The Cadillac Escalade IQ Is Way More Expensive Than The Gas Version,https://www.motor1.com/news/744052/escalade-iq-price/,"The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ starts at $129,900 including destination. That's over $40,000 than the cheapest gas-powered Escalade.",2024-12-25 08:49:34,"Cadillac has released pricing for the Escalade IQ, the all-electric version of its extremely popular luxury people-mover. The 2025 Escalade IQ will start at $129,900 with the $2,290 destination fee included, which is over $40,000 more than the cheapest gas-powered model.
Despite the similar names, the electric IQ and the gas-powered Escalade are fairly different SUVs. While the standard Escalade shares its squared-off bones and V-8 engine with its GM counterparts from Chevy and GMC, the IQ uses the platform found on trucks like the Hummer EV and Silverado EV. It's a foot longer than the gas Escalade and comes with its own body design that's far more sculpted and swept back, to improve aerodynamics.
The Escalade IQ will launch in four trims: Luxury 1, Sport 1, Luxury 2, and Sport 2. No matter which you choose, you'll get a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain powered by an Ultium battery pack with over 200.0 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity. Cadillac says this setup is good for 750 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque, with an estimated range of 460 miles. Pricing with destination for each trim can be seen below.
Aside from styling details like exterior trim and door handles, Luxury 1 and Sport 1 are essentially the same, equipment-wise. Both get standard features like a panoramic glass roof, 24-inch wheels, LED lighting, and rain-sensing wipers. Inside you'll find acres of synthetic leather, heated and ventilated seats, five-zone climate control, and a massive 55.0-inch display for the gauge cluster and infotainment screen.
Step up to Luxury 2 or Sport 2, and you get a 36-speaker sound system by AKG, massaging front seats, and different LED lighting. Importantly, going for either of the two higher trims adds a trailering package as standard, which comes with things like better blind-spot detection, a trailer brake controller, and a suite of apps and camera views to make the trailering experience easier. Opting for Sport or Luxury 2 also allows you to add the Executive Second Row Seating Package, which installs 14-way adjustable seats to the second row, as well as a center console with flip-out tables.
The 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is expected to arrive at dealerships by the end of the year.

Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,2024-12-25 08:49:34,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",2024-12-25 08:49:35,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

Lucid Could Use Two-Speed Transmissions In Future EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/743104/lucid-two-speed-electric-vehicle-patent/,The American automaker is interested in two-speed transmissions that allow electric motors to operate in ideal ranges at different speeds.,2024-12-25 08:49:36,"Although Lucid already makes the world's most efficient electric cars, it's keen to extend its lead. One area other automakers like Porsche have explored to boost their EVs' range is the use of two-speed transmissions. Lucid has yet to do so, but now it looks like it might apply the technology in its own unique way.
If you don't know how Lucid's drive unit works, you should read up on it. The system is ingenious and, as it turns out, flexible. The electric motor's speed is reduced from tens of thousands of RPM down to wheel speeds by two separate planetary gearsets on either end of the casing. This allows the motor and gearboxes to be coaxial, reducing the drive unit's size and mass. Planetary gearboxes can also be used as transmissions by braking separate parts of the mechanism, and that's what Lucid is doing here.
A patent applied for back in 2023 and recently granted to the automaker describes part of this system, although the precise design seems somewhat obscured. Several patents reference different aspects of what is likely a new drive unit configuration, so the exact nature of it all isn't entirely clear just by reading this one document.
What we can nail down, though, is that the system uses one or more planetary sets on either side of a coaxial drive unit to achieve its two speeds. A system of one-way clutches enables these two ratios. How much of a difference in efficiency can this make? Automakers and suppliers have claimed gains in the region of five percent, although it's going to depend on how and where you drive.
Lucid might be shooting higher than that with this unique design. In recent interviews, the automaker's chief executive, Peter Rawlinson, has claimed the company wants to achieve six miles per kilowatt-hour. For reference, the most efficient Lucid Air can currently achieve about five miles per kilowatt-hour. Do the math on a car with a 100kWh battery; it's a big difference not only in pure range, but also the rate at which charging gets you miles back in the battery. Any charging speed is effectively multiplied by the drivetrain's efficiency.
We know Lucid's SUV, the Gravity, is coming soon. Another mid-size car is coming after that. It's plausible that this new drivetrain tech could be applied to any vehicle in the automaker's lineup, though. An updated Air sedan could see a two-speed transmission get added to at least one axle, although that's pure speculation. Until the automaker pipes up, we won't know its plans for this tech.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Rally Actually Rocks: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/742491/2024-ford-mustang-mach-e-rally-review/,This isn't just another crossover with a badge—the Mach-E Rally is genuinely good on the dirt.,2024-12-25 08:49:36,"There are so many crossovers out there pretending to be off-roaders. Hell, you can get a toughened-up Nissan Rogue these days (and honestly, it's not half bad). But for the most part, adding grippier wheels and faux running boards to a crossover does not an off-roader make.
Ford at least put some effort into the new Mach-E Rally. It has a 1.0-inch lift, optimized springs, genuine underbody protection, and a pretty nifty body kit to boot. Tack on the Mach-E GT's powerful output and you've got yourself a genuinely fun little off-road EV.
With two electric motors and a 91.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the Mach-E Rally has 480 horsepower and a whopping 700 pound-feet of torque. Alongside the GT, it's the most powerful Mach-E money can buy—hell, it's one of the torquiest EVs on sale anywhere today.
Tick over to the Mach-E’s “Unbridled” powertrain mode to uncork all 700 lb-ft. A huge wave of electrons launch the rally-ready SUV to 60 miles per hour in 3.4 seconds—just a tenth of a second slower than the standard GT—and on to a limited top speed of 128 mph. It's quick as heck. There's even a faux acceleration sound that's pretty convincing at speed (it sounds like a rumbly V-6).
Ford tweaked the suspension specifically for off-road use. But that also means the Mach-E Rally is plenty compliant on pavement, too. Standard MagneRide shocks, slightly softer dampers, and tweaks to the anti-roll bars and bushings give it a more pliable yet still compliant ride.
There's a titch more body roll when you flick this Mach-E hard into a turn compared to other trims in the model range, presumably from the added ride height. But it handles well otherwise. It has ample body control, excellent balance, and a light but responsive steering feel.
There is some tire noise from the chunkier Michelin CrossClimate2 all-seasons, especially at highway speeds. And that massive rally-style wing makes rearward visibility a thing of the past. But who cares, this thing was made for rallying.
Since I'm about 5,000 miles and an ocean away from Col de Turini, a dinky dirt road is the next-best option. Step one is to dig into the touchscreen (mildly annoying) and select the RallySport drive mode, made specifically for the Mach-E Rally. Activating this mode smooths out the throttle response—instead of an instant shove of torque, power arrives in a more linear way. This mode also softens the dampers and relaxes the traction control just enough to allow you to rip off some sweet dirt drifts. If you really want to get wacky, you can disengage traction control entirely.
Even on this tight dirt road with a few tiny corners, the Mach-E Rally is an absolute hoot. Prod the throttle and yank the steering wheel hard to send the back end into a tidy, refined drift. Get up to speed and the softened suspension skips over rocks and powers through ruts like a genuine rally car, while the chunkier rubber claws its way through the dirt.
There's a bit of cladding on the fenders and side sills to protect it from kicked-up rubble, and a film on the doors helps to save the paint. There's even genuine underbody protection in the form of two panels, front and rear.
The one downside is that the Mach-E Rally doesn't have a limited-slip differential. Instead, it uses brake-based torque vectoring, which is less predictable and harder on the rotors. For the 95 percent of owners who won't take this thing to an actual rally stage, it's no big issue. But for the slim majority who might actually aim this car down a logging road in earnest, you'll have to live without that one key feature.
Otherwise, Ford made a genuinely compelling Mach-E rally car. And it still has all the things that make the standard Mach-E such a great electric SUV.
The extended-range battery comes standard on the Rally model, which gives it 265 miles on a single charge. Plugging into a 150-kilowatt DC fast charger refills it in just over 35 minutes, and there's a one-pedal mode for ultra-efficient driving.
The interior feels premium and airy, with high-end materials almost everywhere you look (apart from a chintzy-feeling rotary shift controller). The Rally model adds gloss white accents on the steering wheel and dash, and a unique trapezoidal pattern shared with the exterior. And love it or hate it, you get the same 15.5 vertical touchscreen found on other Mach-Es with functions like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. It even has BlueCruise hands-free highway driving (a $2,100 option with a three-year subscription).
Not to mention the Mach-E Rally just looks cool as hell. The 19-inch rally-inspired white wheels fit the personality of the car perfectly, the custom grille with two integrated fog lights further hammers home the rally theme, and that massive rear wing looks awesome, which Ford says was inspired by the Focus RS. My test car had two slick racing stripes down the middle with that same trapezoidal pattern from the cabin, though unfortunately, an uninspired Glacier Gray paint job. Go for one of the good colors; Grabber Blue, Grabber Yellow, or Eruption Green.
With a starting price of $60,990 and an as-tested price of $65,485, it’s definitely not the cheapest performance crossover out there ($55,890 for the Mach-E GT AWD and the Rally trim is another $6,000 on top of that). But while I was expecting another warmed-over soft-roader, the Mustang Mach-E Rally was genuinely impressive and thoroughly charming.
See, electric SUVs can be fun.

"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,2024-12-25 08:49:37,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

"Fiat 500e Production Paused, Again",https://www.motor1.com/news/742532/fiat-500-electric-production-paused/,Two Maserati models will also be out of commission for a whole month.,2024-12-25 08:49:37,"Oh, here we go again. Stellantis has no other option but to pause production of the Fiat 500e. Demand for the electric city car continues to be poor, forcing another hiatus at the Mirafiori plant. The Italian factory suspended output several times this year and it's about to do it once more. After telling unions that operations would be suspended from December 18 until January 5, it’s now adding the December 2-17 interval to the stoppage.
Consequently, the Fiat 500e will not be assembled from Monday, December 2, until Sunday, January 5, 2025. It’s not just the diminutive hatchback impacted by the low demand as Maserati is facing an identical problem. Production of the GranTurismo and GrabCabrio will also be halted during this interval. Through the voice of Stellantis’ head honcho Carlos Tavares, the exotic brand recently blamed bad marketing for sluggish sales.
Fiat’s parent company says activities at its factory in Turin will be temporarily stopped due to a ""continuing uncertainty in sales of electric cars in several European markets.” EVs account for 97% of the production at the Mirafiori facility. Stellantis goes on to say it’s putting the brakes on Maserati production as well due to low demand for luxury cars outside Europe, such as the United States and China.
The wheels are in motion to resuscitate sales of the new Fiat 500 by selling a version with a combustion engine. The plan is to roll out a hybrid 500 in 2026 when production will commence at the same Italian site. Made in Poland, the previous-generation model is still sold in certain regions with gas power. Yes, we’re talking about a car that originally hit the market in 2007. Its Abarth hot hatch counterpart is still available, but Fiat’s performance division has already announced plans to go purely electric.

Volkswagen Is Planning A Major Design Overhaul With More Buttons,https://www.motor1.com/news/742405/vw-design-overhaul-more-buttons/,"It also wants to improve interior quality, leading with the next ID.3 and ID.4.",2024-12-25 08:49:38,"Facing plant closures and massive layoffs, it’s safe to say Volkswagen has lost its mojo. The years when the Golf used to dominate sales charts in Europe seem like distant memories. The so-so styling of its electric cars isn’t exactly driving people into showrooms, and the oversimplified interiors aren't helping either. All while prices increase, forcing customers to reconsider their options.
But a fix is on the way, or so VW pledges. In an interview with Auto Express, VW’s development boss Kai Grünitz promised significant changes are planned. The next ID.3 and ID.4 will usher in a ""completely new design language."" That’s great to hear since the bulbous EVs could really need a fresh look. He went on to say a revamped visual identity will mark a return to form by going “back to where we originally came from, from a design perspective, and return to what Volkswagen is known for.”
Stepping inside, the user interface will also be improved by bringing back more traditional controls. Expect future VWs to feature extra buttons to quickly access often-used functions instead of having to rely on submenus on the touchscreen. Aside from adding back conventional keys as previewed by the ID.2all concept, a boost in quality is on the way. That’s one of the major problems the Golf Mk8 is facing, especially when compared to its excellent predecessor.
But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard promises about nicer interiors. At the end of 2022, VW Group chairman Oliver Blume talked about a “quality offensive.” As you can imagine, these changes don’t happen overnight. We’ll have to wait for the next generation of cars to see whether the folks from Wolfsburg live up to their promises.
Talking specifically about the ID.3 and ID.4, Kai said VW will also bring “a lot of improvements in terms of battery costs and performance.” He went as far as to say the overhauled EVs “will be a huge improvement” for both the automaker (by driving down production costs) and its customers by getting better cars overall. The new electric vehicles are expected to arrive in 2026.
It’s too soon to say whether the ID.3 will keep its name. VW has already announced the ninth-generation Golf is going to be electric, with the Mk8 to continue with combustion engines until as late as 2035. At the beginning of the year, Kai strongly hinted the return of the electric Golf could kill the ID.3: “There is not enough space to have two or three different models fitting to the same customer. We've started to work on a fully electric Golf.”

Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",2024-12-25 08:49:38,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

It's Happening: Chrysler Confirms A Pacifica EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/741995/chrysler-pacifica-ev-coming-soon/,Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell revealed plans for the battery-powered minivan at the 2024 LA Auto Show.,2024-12-25 08:49:39,"Right now, Chrysler's only offering to the motoring world is the Pacifica minivan. Technically, the Voyager was resurrected for 2025, but that's really just a Pacifica with fewer options and a lower price tag. Now, we learn another Pacifica variant is coming, this time as a full-on EV.
That's what Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell told Green Car Reports at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show. Design details or a specific debut timeframe weren't mentioned. Chrysler did not immediately respond to comment when reached by Motor1 for confirmation and additional information.
In the report, Feuell alludes to the Halcyon concept as influencing the Pacifica EV. Debuting in February 2024, the Halcyon is actually a sleek, sizable sedan riding on the STLA Large platform. It followed the Chrysler Airflow concept, a sharp electric crossover from 2022 that had a production-ready vibe. The automaker's decision to essentially abandon plans for producion in 2023 came as a surprise, but Feuell reportedly wanted something more modern to take the company into the future.
Chrysler Halcyon Concept
Chrysler Airflow Concept
This whole situation is not without some irony. The Airflow concept utilized the same platform as the Pacifica, which will eventually have an electric version with Halcyon-influenced styling. Meanwhile, Chrysler is supposed to debut its first EV next year— a crossover likely using the STLA Large platform with Airflow influence. Interesting.
We have many questions at this point, including whether Chrysler is still on schedule for its first EV in 2025. Delays have affected other electric ambitions from brands within Stellantis, and we've heard precious little from Chrysler since the Halcyon's debut in February. The current Pacifica should get a significant update for 2026, which likely places a Pacifica EV debuting in late 2026 or 2027.
Of course, this all depends on Stellantis not killing Chrysler before then. The conglomerate's serious financial crisis prompted warnings from CEO Carlos Tavares that underperforming brands could be cut in as little as two or three years.

The Nissan N7 Is A Big Electric Sedan You Can’t Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/741084/2025-nissan-n7-electric-sedan/,Unless you're willing to move to China.,2024-12-25 08:49:39,"In a sea of electric crossovers and SUVs, a good ol' sedan is a nice change of pace. However, there’s still a problem. Nissan’s new EV will be made in China exclusively for the local market. The N7 was developed with local partner Dongfeng through their 50:50 joint venture. If it weren’t for the badge, I’d honestly be hard-pressed to identify this car as a Nissan.
If the N7 already looks familiar, Dongfeng Nissan previewed the production model in April with the Epoch concept. It’s a sleek sedan that ticks all the design trend boxes in 2024: split headlights, a rear light bar, an illuminated logo, two-tone wheels, and a swoopy roofline. The LED daytime running lights send a bit of a Hyundai vibe, but the boomerang-shaped lights below give the car a unique front fascia.
Some would be tempted to say this is Nissan’s first-ever electric sedan. However, that’s not the case. The Leaf-based Sylphy Zero Emission was launched in 2018 as the company’s first EV made for the Chinese market. Just how big is the N7? At 194 inches (4930 millimeters) long and 74.6 inches (1895 millimeters) wide, it’s roughly the same size as a Volkswagen ID.7. However, it sits closer to the road, at 58.5 inches (1487 millimeters) tall. It measures 114.7 inches (2915 millimeters) between the axles, so the wheelbase is a tad shorter than the VW’s.
Nissan isn’t willing to show the interior just yet, nor is it ready to divulge technical specifications beyond the car’s measurements. We do know it sits on a locally developed modular electric architecture and will be offered with a “Navigate on Autopilot” advanced driver-assist system. Inside, the touchscreen should run smoothly courtesy of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295P processor.
The N7 will go on sale in China during the first half of 2025. It’s one of several models included in Nissan’s “The Arc” midterm plan, which will allow the Dongfeng Nissan joint venture to accelerate the launch of hybrid and electric vehicles in China. This strategy calls for a total of 30 models globally by 2027, including seven vehicles for the United States.

Ford Is Already Cutting New EV Production,https://www.motor1.com/news/740842/ford-cuts-explorer-capri-ev-production/,The company blames the 'rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles.',2024-12-25 08:49:40,"Although the Explorer Electric was unveiled in March 2023, Ford didn’t start production until June this year. First shown in July, the Capri reboot hit the assembly line in September. Now, Ford's European business is already reducing output at the Cologne factory in Germany. Why? Because the two Volkswagen-related products are not selling all that well.
German newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger learned from a Ford spokesperson the “rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles” are putting the brakes on Explorer and Capri production. Employees will have no other way but to alternate between working one week and taking one week off until the Christmas vacation. It’s a huge blow to the Cologne operations considering Ford invested $2 billion to get the German plant ready for EV production.
It’s rare for an automaker to slow down a vehicle that has only been in production for a few months. Ford’s electric offensive in Europe came at the expense of the Fiesta, its popular supermini that was shockingly retired from the factory in July 2023. To make matters worse, the company doesn’t have many ICE cars left to fall back on since the Mondeo made in Valencia, Spain died in 2022 and the Focus will be retired in 2025 from the Saarlouis site in Germany.
Through the first nine months of the year, Ford’s market share in the European Union, the UK, and the European Free Trade Association/EFTA region (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) fell from 4.1% to only 3.3%. Numbers published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) show Ford sold only 326,975 passenger cars, down by 18% compared to the January-September 2023 interval.
Automotive News Europe reports additional production cuts at the Cologne factory are planned for early 2025. The company’s first carbon-neutral site has a maximum annual capacity of 250,000 EVs, but hitting that number seems like a pipe dream for now.
Another electric Ford, the F-150 Lightning, is also going through a rough patch. Production at the Dearborn plant in Michigan will be paused from November 15 until January 6, 2025, because of poor demand. The seven-week shutdown includes the usual week-long holiday break and is the second time Ford has idled production. It first happened in February for nine weeks due to quality issues that weren’t solved until April.

The Quickest Cars In The World Are EVs. Here's How They Stack Up In A Drag Race,https://www.motor1.com/news/740382/rimac-nevera-tesla-plaid-lucid-sapphire/,"These three street cars have 4,168 combined horsepower. But only one can be quickest.",2024-12-25 08:49:40,"Looking for the quickest production cars on the planet? You've found them. Every car in this new Dragtimes video is incredibly quick. At 1,020 horsepower, the Tesla Model S Plaid is actually the underdog here, because it's facing the 1,234-hp Lucid Air Sapphire. And both are playing second fiddle to the Rimac Nevera. At 1,914 hp, it's the most powerful production EV in the world.
And all three are lined up on a runway for half-mile drag racing. That's 4,168 combined horses, all in one place.
The video doesn't open with the grand finale. The super sedans race first, ripping to 60 mph in about 1.5 seconds and running quarter-mile times in the low-nine-second range, according to Dragy data. The winner at the half-mile mark is the more powerful Lucid,  crossing the line in 14.42 seconds at 186 mph. The Tesla also reached 186 mph but was a bit slower mid-track, reaching the finish line in 14.56 seconds
Race number two pits the Nevera against the Sapphire, and actually, it's closer than you might expect. Being on an unprepared surface, the 1,914-hp Rimac struggles getting power to the ground. That's reflected in a 0-60 mph time of 2.6 seconds, giving Lucid the early lead. That's soon vanquished, however, as the Nevera flashes past en route to a 13.84-second half-mile time. Its speed at the finish line is 203.9 mph. As for the Sapphire, it lost. But considering the disparity in power between the two cars, the margin isn't as big as you'd expect.
That, finally, brings us to the headlining act for this showdown, which plays out over two races. The first starts from a dig, and as before, the Rimac struggles with traction early on. Both sedans move ahead, but the Lucid Air Sapphire is an absolute monster. It leads the Nevera for nearly the entire half-mile run, only losing out at the very end.
The second race starts from a 40 mph roll. With no traction issues and a Hellcat's worth of extra horsepower over the Lucid, you can probably guess which car wins. But the battle for second place is a legit nail-biter. It shows how the sedans are set up differently for acceleration and speed.
No matter which

This Honda Was Its First EV—25 Years Before The Prologue: Video,https://www.motor1.com/features/740259/honda-ev-plus-close-up/,The Honda EV Plus was the first modern EV to hit American streets - in 1997. This video takes a close look at the last one in the US.,2024-12-25 08:49:41,"The Honda EV Plus might just be the most important EV you've never heard of. This electric car was the first on the American market to use something besides lead-acid car batteries for power. Instead, it used an innovative nickel-metal hydride battery and a Honda-developed brushless motor for an impressive 81 miles of range—in 1997, a decade before the Nissan Leaf was unveiled.
What's even more fascinating is this JDM-looking machine was actually just for Americans. Honda developed it specifically for California to comply with turn-of-the-century EV-mandate laws in the state. after half a decade of research and development, Honda built just 300 of these tiny electric hatchbacks and leased them as fleet and corporate vehicles. They roamed Californian roads for roughly half a decade, and then Honda ended the leases, took the cars back, and crushed 298 of them.
There are two remaining EV Pluses left on Earth, both owned by Honda. I got the rare chance to see one of these two at Honda's headquarters in Torrence, California, and what struck me was just how normal the EV Plus was. Air conditioning, power brakes, electric windows, a heater—all there. It may seem like common-sense that an electric car has all these features in a post-Tesla era, but these were all things that, up until this car, were generally excluded from penalty-box EVs that had to prioritize weight savings and range to squeeze every last drop of mileage out of highly inefficient lead-acid batteries.
While the EV Plus ultimately was relegated to a historical footnote after it became clear that lithium-ion batteries, not nickel-metal hydride, would become the standard for EV power, it's still a fascinating time capsule to the early days of electrification, and I'm excited I got to check it out up close.

The Electric Mercedes CLA Broke A Porsche Taycan Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/740107/electric-mercedes-cla-breaks-record/,CEO Ola Källenius says the new CLA is the 'most intelligent car' the company has ever made.,2024-12-25 08:49:50,"The new CLA isn’t even out yet, but Mercedes is happy to report that its smallest sedan has already set a record. The first fully electric version managed to cover 2,309 miles in a 24-hour interval, besting a record established by Porsche in 2019. The Taycan did 2,128 miles at the same Nardo test track in Italy—the CLA EV beat it by 181 miles.
On the 7.8-mile Nardo Ring banked oval, the zero-emission CLA averaged 95 miles per hour and had to be recharged 40 times, with each stop taking about 10 minutes. The electric compact sedan didn’t move for about 6 hours and 40 minutes, or nearly 28% of the 24 hours. Rather than making fewer, longer stops, Mercedes capitalized on the car’s 800V electric architecture and DC charging, enabling an initial charge boost.
During the record-breaking run, which actually took place back in April, the near-production prototype’s battery dropped to 10% before the CLA made those 40 pit stops to recharge it back to 55% or a bit more. The car only covered approximately 60 miles between charges. Mercedes remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications, but we do know that it used a rear-wheel-drive variant with a single motor and a two-speed transmission. A beefier dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model will be offered.
Although the brand is focusing on the electric CLA, there will be versions with a combustion engine. The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe rival will be offered with a newly developed 2.0-liter gasoline engine made in China by Horse Powertrain. If that doesn't ring a bell, it’s a joint venture between Geely and Renault. We’ll remind you that Chinese investor Li Shufu, founder and chairman of Geely, has a 9.69% share in Mercedes. Side note–China's BAIC Group has another 9.98% of the company’s voting rights.
The overhauled CLA will go on sale next year, but the initial variants will be electric. The mild-hybrid models are expected to hit the market about six months later. The sedan will be joined by another CLA Shooting Brake, which should once again be a traditional wagon despite its fancy title. The Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture will also underpin the next-gen GLA and GLB crossovers.
The off-road-oriented “Little “G” announced last year is likely to utilize the same MMA platform. We’re not expecting another A-Class sedan or a B-Class minivan.

California Forced Automakers To Build EVs In The '90s. They Were Doomed From The Start,https://www.motor1.com/features/738827/trendsetting-yet-forgotten-japanese-evs/,"Decades before the Prologue, BZ4X, or even the Leaf, Japan built a batch of special electric cars just for America.",2024-12-25 08:49:56,"When we think of iconic Japanese cars, the influential models from the motherland spring to mind—the 1JZ A70 Supra, the R34 Skyline, the 2000GT. But after Japanese marques established a foothold in the States, some of their most interesting projects were built just for us. Take, for example, the earliest commercially viable electric cars produced by the Japanese Big Three. While forgotten today, this trio laid the groundwork for our modern era. These early EVs existed solely because of, and for, Americans.
In 1990, the California Air Resources Board passed its first zero-emissions vehicle (or “ZEV”) mandates. They applied to every large automaker selling cars in the state, and they were remarkably aggressive. The rules stated that by 1998, 2% of a car company’s total sales in California had to be zero-emission. By 2003, a staggering 10% of a carmaker’s vehicles sold in the state would need to be ZEVs. While last year, over a quarter of new cars sold in California were zero-emission, in 1990, 10% was unimaginable.
In 1990, the best-selling EV in American history was this: the Vanguard-Sebring CitiCar/Commuter Vehicles Comuta-Car, first introduced in 1974 in the deepest throes of the fuel crisis. It boasted 40 miles of range, a top speed of 40 miles per hour (headwind-limited), and anywhere from 2.5 to 6 horsepower. Power was supplied via a 48-volt array of lead-acid golf cart batteries. It cost $2,998 at its launch. By the time it finally died in the early Eighties, roughly 4,400 had been sold.
After Commuter Vehicles discontinued building its doorstop on wheels in 1982, basically no commercially successful attempts at an EV hit the market for the next decade. This put automakers in an intense bind. They had to develop zero-emissions vehicles essentially from scratch, and they had to do it fast or risk losing the massive and invaluable California car market entirely.
In 1990, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all sold enough cars in California to meet the terms of the mandate. All three companies began work on EVs so as not to lose this valuable market.
By the time the 1998 deadline rolled around, manufacturers and the California state government realized that building tens of thousands of commercially feasible EVs in just eight years would be entirely impossible. The regulations were softened to require just a few hundred cars to be produced (the exact number would depend on exactly how many cars the manufacturer had sold in the state in previous years). Still, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all needed to develop vehicles. The three companies came up with wildly innovative cars, all with a different spin on early EV technology.
Toyota was later to the EV rush than some of its contemporaries, not unlike today, with its research program starting late in 1992. The company hit the ground quickly, though, and developed a handful of lease-only Japanese market EV prototypes by 1993, including a lead-acid battery-powered Townace van and a Crown Majesta fleet sedan. Serious progress wouldn’t come until 1995, however, when the RAV4 EV initiative began.
Some early RAV4 EVs sported similar lead-acid battery technology that the Comuta-car—and every EV dating back to the dawn of the electric car—had used. Manufacturers, including Toyota, rapidly realized that lead-acid batteries simply would not cut it for mass-market cars. Lead-acid batteries degrade relatively rapidly when repeatedly run from full to zero charge, and they have a terrible energy density at just 35 watt-hours per kilogram.
For an idea of how poor this performance is, the 118.0-kilowatt-hour Lucid Air Grand Touring battery, if it were composed of lead-acid batteries, would weigh 7,431 pounds by itself. (It would also probably need its own travel trailer—lead-acid batteries are generally not compact.) As a result of this terrible energy density, electric cars in the 90s were facing what’s known to engineers as the tyranny of the rocket equation: to get more payload (or range), you have to add more fuel, which means more weight. That additional fuel weight necessitates more fuel. Eventually, you’re adding extra fuel just to launch the extra fuel.
To get more range out of EVs without sacrificing every modern convenience, a new power solution was required. In 1995, Toyota partnered with Panasonic to use their new nickel-metal hydride (or NiMH) batteries. These batteries, which were a relatively recent development, possessed twice the energy density of lead-acid batteries at roughly 70 watt-hours per kilogram, were lower maintenance, and required fewer toxic materials to build. Toyota began testing by putting a set in a limited-production, three-door RAV4 and entering it in the First Scandinavian Electric Car Rally, a 351-mile race from Göteborg, Sweden to Oslo, Norway. The RAV4 won.
After building roughly 100 three-door versions for Japan and Europe, the company fixed its sights on the California market in time for the 1998 mandate. The company built five-door, left-hand-drive RAV4 models with nickel-metal hydride batteries starting in 1997. These larger models had more storage space, as the batteries would fit entirely under the floor. They also featured all the creature comforts that American buyers expected—airbags, ABS, heated seats, air-conditioning, heating—and a slightly more powerful motor.
By modern standards, it was still a tame EV, with a top speed of just 78 miles an hour and an EPA-rated range of 95 miles, but it worked.  These cars were first offered solely to public utilities and fleet buyers as leases—typical for the early EV era—in small quantities. Toyota produced 1,484 in total, making it the most widely produced of any EV of this era.
Unlike its Nissan and Honda contemporaries, however, Toyota offered the public the chance to buy the Toyota RAV4 EV in 2002. Toyota reported 328 sales—not shabby for an MSRP of $42,000, or roughly $75,000 in today’s dollars—and there are still RAV4 EVs on the road today. The NiMH battery technology was easily adapted to the Prius, where it was used in the first three generations of cars. It also was found underpinning one of its competitors.
Honda’s initial strategy mirrored Toyota’s. Take a global-market gas vehicle, slap some lead-acid batteries and an electric motor into it, and go for a spin. The company’s first serious EV project began in 1990, and a team of roughly 100 engineers turned a Honda CR-X into an EV with off-the-shelf parts. The car made its maiden test run in mid-1991, but it was a letdown to Honda executives. Junichi Araki, project lead, was especially displeased; he reportedly said “You call this a car? What the heck did you just make?” The team re-oriented itself with the goal of building “the finest EV in the world”, and started from scratch.
Testing continued through the mid-90s in California and Japan with a variety of platforms, including a modified Wagovan and a fully rebodied Civic called the “CUV-4”. The CUV-4 was a more complete vehicle than the chopped-and-hacked CRX that preceded it, but it still used lead-acid batteries, and as a result, achieved a dismal 30 miles of maximum range in the heat of Southern California. Honda ultimately came to the same conclusion as Toyota: new technology was needed. Nickel-metal hydride batteries were sourced, and the lightly modified Civic platform was ditched in favor of a heavily modified Honda Logo design, the subcompact successor to the JDM Honda City.
Like the Toyota RAV4 EV, Honda kept focus on ensuring the new EV—christened the EV Plus—would retain all of the functionality of a traditional petroleum-powered machine. Air conditioning, heating, a stereo, power locks, and a full suite of safety features were standard. Honda also went the extra mile for the drivetrain, internally developing its own DC brushless motor. This was unusual for the era, as EVs were still so niche that off-the-shelf components were the only way to make them remotely economical. The decision did give the Honda EV Plus a notable boost over its competition: while it only had 66 horsepower, it made 203 pound-feet of torque. That was good enough for a sub-five-second 0-30 time, and gave it acceleration that felt much more like a modern neck-snapping EV than the Comuta-Cars that preceded it.
Manufacturing of the EV Plus began at the Takanezawa plant—Honda’s specialty vehicle factory where the NSX, Insight, and S2000 all hailed from—in early 1997. By late 1997, the EV Plus was in the hands of California fleet buyers (as leases). This timing meant the EV Plus was technically the first mass-produced, non-lead-acid-battery EV ever to be in buyers’ hands, as it beat the RAV4 EV to market by a handful of months.
The car was moderately successful, and a modified version was even entered in the 1999 Pikes Peak hillclimb, setting a new record for the electric car class. Despite these successes, Honda pulled the plug on the EV Plus program virtually the second it met its CARB requirements in 1999, with somewhere around 330 cars produced in total and 300 on Californian roads. Although the EV Plus had an advertised MSRP of around $53,000 (over $100,00 in 2024 dollars), none were ever actually offered for sale.
By the early 2000s, California had given up on its aggressive EV mandates after realizing companies simply couldn’t manufacture them in vast numbers—and at the prices—that would be needed to hit a whopping 10% of new car sales. When CARB abandoned EVs, so did Honda, and the EV Plus leases were ended and the cars returned to Honda. Only two cars are known to exist today, both in Honda museums—the rest were all destroyed.
There was one more Japanese EV of the era, however, even less well-publicized than either the EV Plus or the RAV4 EV, and it proved to be the most prescient.
Nissan had the longest history of experimenting with electrification of any of the major Japanese OEMs, with its first production EV—the 1947 Tama E4S—developed in response to widespread oil and gas shortages in the wake of World War II. The E4S, first developed by the Tachikawa Aircraft Company (later the Tama Electric Car Company, then merged into Prince Motors, which would one day become Nissan) entered only limited manufacture as an urban taxi, but was the first of a handful of all-electric cars the company manufactured through the early 50s as fuel shortages continued.
1947 TAMA E4S
Nissan EV-4 Concept Truck
March EV Concept
Tama eventually stopped producing EVs as postwar Japan’s economy and supply chain recovered, but Nissan as a whole kept experimenting with EV technology in the coming decades. In 1973, the company debuted an all-electric cabover truck concept called the EV-4 that, while it never made production, boasted 180 miles of range, regenerative braking, and made it as far as crash testing. The company continued toying with the tech, building limited runs of an electrified Laurel sedan, an induction-motor powered March convertible, an Avenir cargo wagon, as well as other one-off models and concept cars.
The real breakthrough, however, came in 1996 with the Prairie Joy EV. The Prairie Joy EV was a simple conversion of a gas model (the Nissan Prairie minivan, sold briefly in America as the Axxess) like many of Nissan’s other attempts at electrification. However, this vehicle bore one significant difference: it was powered by lithium-ion batteries. Only thirty were built for Japanese fleet usage, but the initial results were strong: one of them did six years of service at the world’s northernmost permanent arctic settlement in Svalbard, Norway, proving the novel and unique lithium battery tech—which up until that point had only been used for small consumer electronics like phones and laptops—would last even in incredibly hostile conditions. Lithium also represented a massive leap in potential performance over NiMH batteries, as although they were expensive and required rare materials, the energy density could potentially reach three times that of NiMH.

With proven tech in hand, Nissan moved on to meeting the CARB requirements. The base vehicle would be the R’nessa minivan, a gas-powered car from the Japanese market. This new EV, known as the Altra, preserved modern functionality like keyless entry, heat and air conditioning, and power windows, and boasting a DC permanent magnet motor under the hood. The Altra EV also produced an impressive 83 horsepower, the most of any Japanese EV of its era.
Altra EV Battery Pack (Press photo, provided via Dean Case)
For power, Sony produced car-sized battery packs specially for Nissan’s EV project, assembling 96 individual cells into a 345v, 32.4-kWh unit. The pack wasn’t light for its output, at over 800 pounds, but the Altra EV boasted the longest range of any EV on the market at the time of its introduction, at an EPA-rated 90 miles (the GM EV1, when it was released with a NiMH pack in 1999, did manage to best this with 105 miles of range—but it was built specifically to be an EV). Additionally, the lithium-ion pack was projected to last ten years of driving before needing replacement, years longer than a lead-acid battery could last (and seven years longer than Honda projected the NiMH EV Plus battery would survive).
The lithium packs were wildly expensive: insider sources in the era estimated each battery cost Nissan $50,000-70,000 in 1997, more than the MSRP of $50,999. Like the Honda EV Plus, however, buying an Altra EV was a purely hypothetical exercise. None were ever sold to private customers; they were only used by Nissan employees and corporate lease customers. Around 200 were produced in total until the Altra was canned in 2002. Like the Honda EV Plus, when the remaining leases ended, the cars were rounded up and largely destroyed. As I researched this story, I could only confirm the existence of two Altras left on this Earth.
Obviously, repealing those CARB laws paused the development of EVs, as it was no longer required and the economies of scale simply didn’t allow their existence. The largest roadblocks in this era stemmed from a lack of battery development. NiMH, despite being a vast improvement over ancient lead-acid technology, suffered poor performance in extreme temperatures, high weight, and high pack costs.
Additionally, the specific battery design used by Toyota—which stuck with EVs the longest after the end of the CARB mandate—had its patent purchased by Texaco, which sued aggressively to stop further development. NiMH as an EV battery was dead in its tracks, although it still got mainstream usage in Honda’s Insight and Toyota’s Prius hybrids for years to come.
Still, lessons were learned. Motor tech advanced rapidly during this era. The dominant 400V standard for vehicle architecture was developed and standardized. J1772 charging—the standard for Level 2 for most companies until the past year—was developed from lessons learned from this era’s cars. Most importantly, lithium development continued, and currently underpins every major EV currently on the market. Nissan continued work on electric cars through the 2000s, and in 2009, the Nissan Leaf debuted as a purchasable mass-produced EV. It easily earned and retained the all-time electric vehicle sales crown until 2020, when Tesla finally surpassed it.
These forgotten cars laid the groundwork for the current era of electrification. Plus, they’re just cool—It can be easy to forget that EVs, now so ubiquitous, were once alien feats of electrical and automotive engineering. These cars offer a glimpse into an era of ingenuity that built the world we live in today.

It Sure Looks Like GM Is Copying Lucid's Homework,https://www.motor1.com/news/739460/gm-lucid-drive-unit-patent/,The Detroit automaker has a design for a new drive unit that incorporates one of Lucid's key mechanical concepts.,2024-12-25 08:49:58,"Lucid Motors builds the most efficient electric vehicles in the world, and the rest of the auto industry wants a piece of that efficiency. Some, like Aston Martin, see fit to simply purchase the automaker's tech. Others want to develop it for themselves. One of those companies appears to be General Motors, which recently applied for a patent on a compact electric drive unit that uses one of Lucid's key architectural features: the differential-in-rotor design.
For those unfamiliar, Lucid pioneered a unique structural approach to building compact and efficient electric drive units. In most cases, an electric motor consists of an outside stator and an inside rotor, the latter of which spins. Many electric vehicles have solid rotors, but the inside of this structure doesn't actually produce much torque. Lucid miniaturized its drive unit by making the rotor donut-shaped and putting the differential inside. Since it doesn't experience wheel torque directly, this diff can be much smaller, lighter, and more efficient. This tiny differential drives two coaxial planetary gearsets, which drive the wheels. The 49:30 mark in this video from Lucid explains this very smart innovation better than I can via text:
General Motors' patent application takes this core differential concept and applies it to a slightly different system. Interestingly, the automaker is cagey in the document about explicitly saying it's putting a small differential inside of the rotor. In fact, the three-dimensional drawings provided with the patent omit both the electric motor and differential completely. The two-dimensional illustrations provided with the patent make it clear that's what's going on, though.
The only real hint in the document text that the differential sits inside the rotor happens near the end of the patent, where it's stated that it sits ""upstream"" from the rest of the geartrain. Other than that, no other mention of the differential or rotor in the text describes their nested nature.
In the diagram, 301 is the rotor, 501 is the stator, and 600 is the differential.
To be clear, there are several differences between Lucid's drive unit and the one described in GM's patent. The first big difference is that GM's unit is not coaxial. The rotor, intermediate reduction gears, and axle outputs are all on different axes. GM's unit is likewise a locking differential. This means it could be used in a performance or off-road setting where locking the diff would be advantageous. Lucid's electric drive units do not have a mechanical locking feature, although the company's dual-motor drive units offer complex torque vectoring.
The crux of the patent is that this new design would be compact and extremely efficient, which is naturally the same concept Lucid is chasing. The document claims that ""In certain embodiments, the drive unit architecture described herein provides for up to 95% efficiency."" That's very impressive, if its true.
Until such a drive unit is released—this is just a patent, after all—we won't know if GM actually plans to do anything with this design. It's an appealing unit on paper, if not quite so theoretically compact as Lucid's, and chasing efficiency is everything for automakers building EVs.

Polestar Says Biden's China Tech Ban Will Kill Its Business,https://www.motor1.com/news/739301/polestar-china-tech-ban-kill-sales/,"A new rule could ban cars with certain Chinese technology from American roads, even ones built in the US.",2024-12-25 08:49:58,"Last month, the US Commerce Department proposed a new rule prohibiting the sale and import of connected cars from China and Russia into the United States. If it passes, Polestars says the rule could prevent it from selling the vehicles it builds in South Carolina in America.
Polestar, in a submitted comment to the department, said that the proposed rule as drafted ""would effectively prohibit Polestar from selling its cars in the United States."" The automaker highlighted its concerns with the rule's broad definitions, proposing the agency narrow the scope of the components and systems that would be included in the ban.
Ford echoed similar concerns in its comment about the wording, saying, ""That certain language in the proposed rule could be interpreted in an overly broad and unnecessarily expansive manner."" It could prevent automakers that build cars in China from selling them here—like the Lincoln Nautilus, which the Blue Oval builds in the People's Republic.
Nissan, Hyundai Motor Group, Volkswagen Group of America, Volvo, and Tesla also submitted comments. All proposed the agency better define the scope of the rules and refine the language to improve clarity.
Many also took issue with the proposed timeline. As written, the rule's software prohibitions would take effect for the 2027 model year, while the hardware restrictions would kick in for 2030. That's too soon, according to automakers. Usually, they design new products three to five years before production starts.
HMG said the limited timeline would prevent companies from complying with the requirements. Honda said the industry would need time to conduct proper testing and validation to limit ""the potential for creating other safety vulnerabilities."" VW asked the agency to delay implementing the hardware ban until 2031 to give it time to comply.
The newly proposed rule is just the latest in a series of legislative and policy moves intended to protect US national security as connected cars that collect troves of information hit American roads.

Very Original: Mopar EV-Swapped Plymouth GTX,https://www.motor1.com/news/739152/mopar-plymouth-gtx-electromod/,"The GTX Electromod showcases a potential EV conversion kit, so you too can remove the one thing that defines a classic muscle car.",2024-12-25 08:49:59,"Among the many gasoline and electric vehicles on display at SEMA this year will be a deliciously blue 1967 Plymouth GTX. Don't get excited about the wild V-8 engine under the hood of this modified muscle car, however. In its place is a single electric motor driving the rear wheels.
It's called the Plymouth GTX Electromod Concept, and it comes from Mopar, the decades-old parts division of Chrysler that is now the parts group for all of Stellantis. Back in the 1960s, Mopar dished out all kinds of performance upgrades for pretty much every V-8 in the Chrysler family. That includes the GTX, which debuted in 1967 as a humble Belvedere two-door hardtop muscled up with two engine options: a 375-horsepower 440 cubic inch (7.2) V-8, or the legendary 426 Hemi.
Flash forward to 2024, and Mopar is testing the waters with a conceptual electric conversion kit for classic cars. Called the e-Crate, it's not unlike the various Hellcat setups currently available for custom builds. At the heart is a 400-volt, 250-kilowatt electric drive module that installs neatly under the hood using custom mounts. Power comes from four battery packs, three of which are mounted in the trunk. The fourth is positioned up front behind the grille for better weight distribution, which is important considering each pack weighs 230 pounds. The system is rated for 73 kilowatt-hours and gives the GTX an estimated range of 250 miles.
But range and efficiency were never defining factors for a muscle car. It's all about power, and on that front, this GTX Electromod makes ""approximately 335 horsepower and torque,"" according to Mopar. That's less than the car's original 440, never mind the Hemi. There is no transmission; it goes to the rear wheels through a 3:1 gear reducer. So at least there's very little (if any) driveline loss. Performance stats aren't mentioned.
The rest of the car features typical restomod upgrades. It has a lowered suspension with 18-inch wheels and Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners. A custom hood is made from carbon fiber, and at the back, the wheel arches are wider. Bumpers front and rear are trimmed for a cleaner fit, and you won't find a lick of chrome anywhere. The blue interior has some personality, with bronze and stainless steel trim on the dash and door panels. There are new seats, a new center console, and digital gauges behind a retro-themed steering wheel. The Mopar team also added a cupholder, because all muscle cars need a cupholder.
This certainly isn't the first time we've seen a major automaker EV-swap a classic muscle car. And with the future still rolling (albeit slower) towards electric power, we doubt this will be the last.

We Rode Shotgun In Cadillac's Rolls-Royce Rival,https://www.motor1.com/features/736625/cadillac-celestiq-pre-production-riding-shotgun/,"We get an early ride in the $350,000 Cadillac Celestiq EV. Here's what it was like.",2024-12-25 08:49:59,"The Cadillac Celestiq starts at $340,000. It’s a handbuilt ultra-luxury sedan with its sights set on Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and the first of its kind in the General Motors lineup. While nobody in the press has had the opportunity to drive one yet, I recently got the chance to ride shotgun in the Celestiq to see what all the fuss was about.
The Celestiq is the brand’s most audacious car in recent memory. Not only does it stand alone in the automaker’s lineup price-wise, but it’s only the second high-end electric luxury car after the Rolls-Royce Spectre. The Cadillac is also completely bespoke and the only EV in GM’s current lineup to get a unique battery module design, which enables a thinner floor.
That long, thin battery is possible because the Celestiq is a huge car. Its scale and proportions aren’t immediately obvious in photos, but standing alongside it, I’m in awe of its size. I’m a few inches shy of six feet, and the 23-inch wheels are nearly up to my waist. At the same time, the roof of the car sits extremely low—well below my shoulders.
Pressing a button on the car’s B-pillar swings open the passenger door, and it latches shut with a soft close. I wasn’t driven long enough to get a great judgment on how comfortable the seats were, but they certainly weren't uncomfortable. But the most striking thing about sitting reclined in the Celestiq was how roomy and quiet it was.
The interior is unlike any other car I’ve experienced in terms of its size and shape. It’s extremely wide and long inside, yet the low roof and sleek window openings make it quite cozy. The flat floor also gives a concept car vibe to the whole experience. My Celestiq had about as basic an interior as any prospective owner might spec—black-on-black with some doubtlessly real walnut trim—but it still felt special. You could even see all the way back into the carefully upholstered trunk, adding to that sensation of spaciousness.
The burnt orange exterior was one of the better colors I’ve seen on this car, which was still a development mule. Behind the wheel was a GM software integration engineer. I asked him what didn’t work on this particular vehicle, and he said it was pretty much ready to go. On my side of the center tunnel was some electronic diagnostics equipment, but besides that, the vehicle seemed complete.
Browsing through menus as fast as I could, there weren’t any features I tried that didn’t function, including the variable-tint roof. With a single press, all the panels either go dark, remain clear, or can be adjusted individually to one of four levels. There was also an automatic setting.
In terms of the ride quality, it takes the smooth, serene qualities of the Lyriq to another level. The Celestiq didn’t really hit bumps; instead, it felt like it simply rose over them. Every time I spotted an imperfection on the tarmac, the Celestiq handled it better than I expected. The combination of air springs and GM’s latest magnetic ride control dampers in a vehicle with such a long wheelbase was incredible.
But the cherry on top was all the minute details. Switching on the heated seats also made the armrests balmy—not a new technology, but still great to have. All four passengers get a vent between the headrest and the seat, which blows hot or cold air on your neck. Mine was just barely blowing out some hot, dry air when I got in—almost imperceptibly—but it was very pleasant.
Until we drive a carefully tailored example, though, we won’t know what Cadillac has in store for buyers of its most expensive car. From my initial experience, the Celestiq checked a lot of boxes, even from the passenger’s seat. But stepping into the ultra-luxury space is difficult, even with many past concept cars predicting such a move.
The Celestiq is a fantastic canvas, but seeing if buyers are truly interested in customizing this cavernous Cadillac will be the real test.

Hyundai Gave The Kona A Weird Off-Road Makeover,https://www.motor1.com/news/738706/hyundai-kona-off-road-version/,It's named after the Earth's largest active volcano and looks like a 1990s base model.,2024-12-25 08:50:01,"Seemingly out of nowhere, there's a limited-run special edition of the electric Kona in Japan. Hyundai calls it the ""Mauna Loa"" after the biggest active volcano in the world. Painted in Mirage Green, the small crossover has been turned into a pseudo-offroader with Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires.
The chunky rubber measures 205/65 R16 and is combined with matte black wheels supplied by Weds. For better off-road chops, Hyundai installs smaller wheels compared to the regular model's 17-inch set with 215/60 R17 tires. We're not entirely sure whether that was the intention but the new wheels seem to mimic bedlock wheels used by proper go-anywhere vehicles.
Addressing the elephant in the room, the bumpers and side skirts make the Mauna Loa look like a base model from the 1990s. While those cars had unpainted bumpers to keep the price low, the Kona's are sprayed with scratch-resistant paint. That should make the body panels more durable when you’re off the beaten path in your electric Kona. Hyundai calls it a ""unique uneven finish"" with a textured look that has a ""subdued shine.""
Rounding off the upgrades on the outside are mudguards on all four wheels, black weatherstripping, dark badges, and standard roof bars for extra practicality. Stepping inside, Hyundai installs easy-to-clean floor mats and a cargo mat made from rubber as well. Much like the body, the interior is also predominantly green but with neon yellow accents for a contrasting effect.
Although the Kona Mauna Loa caters to outdoorsy people, Hyundai insisted on covering the seats in leather upholstery. We'd reckon cloth would've made more sense since it's easier to clean and more durable in time. Elsewhere, customers can get a few more accessories, including a folding chair and storage pockets that can be attached to the back of the front seats. Two different-sized cargo boxes are also available.
Hyundai is making only 30 units of the Kona Mauna Loa and is charging 4.95 million yen. At current exchange rates, that works out to about $32,500, making it about $2,800 more expensive than the electric Kona Voyage upon which it's based. It has the bigger 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for 336 miles.

The Kia Niro Tri-Fuel Is An Unusual Hybrid With Huge Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/738233/kia-niro-tri-fuel/,"It can cover 1,000 miles before refueling.",2024-12-25 08:50:03,"If you have a severe case of range anxiety, then a fully electric vehicle probably isn't the right choice. A hybrid makes more sense, especially if you frequently do long trips and don't want to worry about running out of juice. After Subaru launched a Crosstrek hybrid that can do 621 miles before refueling, Kia promises to smash the 1,000-mile barrier with its own electrified compact crossover.
The Niro Tri-Fuel isn't your run-of-the-mill hybrid crossover despite looking instantly familiar. That's because it also runs on liquified petroleum gas thanks to an LPG tank mounted under the cargo floor where you'd normally find the spare wheel. The LPG tank can store 10.5 gallons while the gas tank carries 11.1 gallons.
With two full tanks, the Niro Tri-Fuel can cover about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers)—a range EVs can only dream of. Even most diesels will struggle to reach that figure unless you're a fan of hypermiling. It gets better since the CO2 emissions are reduced by 6% compared to the regular hybrid. In Italy where this version is being launched, Kia says this is the first full-hybrid that can also run on LPG.
There's a button mounted next to the start/stop button the driver pushes to make the 1.6-liter engine run on LPG and check the amount of fuel left. The naturally aspirated four-cylinder unit produces 90 hp and works with an electric motor rated at 43 hp that draws its energy from a 1.32-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 126 hp and 195 lb-ft.
The conversion to LPG is performed by gas equipment company BRC part of the Westport Fuel Systems Italia but the car still comes with the full seven-year / 93,205-mile (150,000-km) warranty. Kia has done the math and believes an owner can save as much as €5,000 ($5,410) on refueling costs.
However, customers must pay a €2,000 (nearly $2,200) premium compared to the regular model. Pricing kicks off at €34,450 ($37,300) for the base model and rises to €39,200 ($42,400) for the flagship trim level.

Stellantis Could Make Fewer Gas Cars to Avoid Emissions Fines,https://www.motor1.com/news/738251/stellantis-cut-gas-car-production/,Production cuts might start next month.,2024-12-25 08:50:04,"Last month, Stellantis admitted it has too many unsold cars in North America. To get rid of excess inventory, it plans to assemble fewer cars in the coming months. Over in Europe, production could be cut as well, but for a different reason. The automotive conglomerate is concerned making too many ICEs will increase the risk of paying fines for exceeding fleet emissions targets.
Freshly appointed Chief Operating Officer of Stellantis' operations in Europe, Jean-Philippe Imparato, said the company is ready to reduce the output of gasoline and diesel cars. The COO told Automotive News Europe the production cuts could commence as early as next month. Why so soon? Because the EU's fleet emissions target will become considerably stricter from January 1, 2025.
The current fleet average target of 115.1 g/km (WLTP) will go down by approximately 19% in 2025 to 93.6 g/km. As previously reported, only Tesla and Geely were below next year's level in the first six months of 2024. It's worth noting that each automaker has its target, resulting from the average mass of its fleet. Consequently, companies that sell more SUVs have higher targets than those with smaller vehicles.
What happens when automakers fail to meet the targets? They pay fines–€95 per excess gram per car. As you can imagine, that quickly adds up when you're an automotive juggernaut such as Stellantis. Recently, Renault boss Luca de Meo said automakers active in Europe are at risk of paying €15 billion in fines, although The Financial Times quotes Barclays Bank saying it'll likely be around the €10+ billion mark.
Strong demand for EVs could allow Stellantis to build more gas cars. However, the numbers aren’t looking good so far this year. In the EU+EFTA+UK region, purely electric cars accounted for only 14.7% through September, down by 15.2% in the first nine months of 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
Stellantis will channel its car production efforts toward EVs rather than ICEs, even though the profit margins are likely still higher for gas/diesel cars. The world's fourth-largest automaker must've done the math and figured it's better to sell fewer ICEs than risk paying fines.
Car manufacturers will continue to struggle to meet fleet emissions targets, especially since the EU will lower the limit even more from 2030. Beginning with the next decade, the threshold will go down from next year's 93.6 g/km to 49.5 g/km. From 2035, automakers in Europe must reach 0 g/km, effectively putting an end to new cars powered by combustion engines. The EU will leave the door open for ICEs running on synthetic fuel or hydrogen. However, we can't imagine the refueling infrastructure will be ready only a decade from now.

Even BMW's Gas Cars Will Look Like EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/737818/bmw-gas-car-neue-klasse-ev-design/,The 'Neue Klasse' design language isn't just for electrification.,2024-12-25 08:50:05,"BMW's Neue Klasse concepts offered a glimpse into the future of the brand's upcoming design language. The Neue Klasse sedan debuted in 2023, and the Neue Klasse X crossover showed up earlier this year. But while many of us assumed those two concepts would preview the next era of BMW's electric vehicles, head of design Adrian van Hooydonk says that won't be the case.
In an interview with Top Gear at this year's Paris Motor Show, van Hooydonk said that every upcoming BMW will use cues from the Neue Klasse concepts—combustion cars included. Some cars will be available in both gas and electric flavors, with slightly different design elements (and proportions) to set them apart.
""The big push with EVs, these technologies, and this design language, will transfer over the entire product portfolio including our combustion vehicles,"" said van Hooydonk. ""For the customer, it won't be difficult—they will all get new modern BMWs and they can choose the drivetrain.""
That’s good news if you’re a fan of BMW’s Neue Klasse design language. Even more promising is that van Hooydonk thinks the production models will look “even better” than the concepts.
""You know how close the i3 and i8 were to their concept cars? That's what's going to happen here. If anything I like the production cars better because they're a bit more compact,"" he said.
BMW will have at least five Neue Klasse models on the road by 2029. That includes a new 3 Series—and an M3—an SUV or two, and even a sporty, high-riding coupe that we caught the company testing just a few months ago. The first of the Neue Klasse models could debut as early as next year, with the majority of which arriving in 2026 and beyond.

Porsche Taycan Sales Have Fallen Off A Cliff,https://www.motor1.com/news/737086/porsche-taycan-global-sales/,"Meanwhile, buyers are scooping up 718s before Porsche pulls the plug next year.",2024-12-25 08:50:06,"Porsche announced third-quarter and year-to-date sales so far in 2024, and things aren't looking good for the Taycan. The company's flagship EV is down a whopping 50 percent globally—just 14,042 have been sold from January through September. It's a contributing factor in Porsche posting an overall global sales drop of 7 percent.
The decline isn't solely related to electric power, however. The Panamera plunged 20 percent, logging 21,506 sales. The Macan, one of the company's top-selling vehicles, also recorded a 20-percent drop with 55,000 units sold. Porsche says the struggles are largely due to refreshed models arriving at dealerships, though it's worth noting the company stopped selling the gas-powered Macan in Europe, contributing to the dip in sales.
""The market environment remains challenging worldwide,"" said Detlev von Platen, sales and marketing executive board member at Porsche. ""However, with the youngest model range in the company's history and a sales structure that remains very balanced in the sales regions, we are in a robust position. Our strategy of value-oriented sales has proven its worth and will continue to form the basis of our actions in the future.""
Looking at regional numbers, things are particularly bad in China, where Porsche is down 29 percent. Sales are also down in North America, though it isn't nearly as dire at 5 percent. The company blames ""the ongoing tense economic situation"" in China and ""limited production availability"" for North America as the reasons.
Curiously, there's no mention of softening demand for EVs that's affecting virtually every automaker right now. With the company rolling out the new electric Macan and EV replacements for the 718 just around the corner—and with crosstown rivals Mercedes and BMW also struggling big time in China amid their own EV push—we suspect there are some nervous executives right now in Stuttgart.
It's not entirely doom and gloom for Porsche. The Cayenne is still the company's best-selling vehicle by a wide margin; sales are up 21 percent with 77,686 sold so far this year. We're happy to report 911 sales are also up 2 percent, at 39,744 deliveries. Ironically, the 718 Boxster and Cayman logged 18,048 sales, a year-over-year increase of 10 percent. These models will be discontinued next year.
""2024 is a particularly challenging year for us with limited product availability in some cases,"" said von Platen. ""However, we are deliberately focusing on a quality-oriented ramp-up in our new model series so that we can continue to offer our customers an unmistakable brand and product experience in the future.""

This Is An Alpine SUV Because Nothing Is Sacred Anymore,https://www.motor1.com/news/736958/alpine-a390-concept-debut/,"Et tu, Alpine?",2024-12-25 08:50:06,"Ah, just what we needed. Yet another SUV. I've always thought of Alpine as being the French equivalent of Lotus since they've focused on lightweight sports cars. Much like the peeps from Norfolk now have an electric SUV with the Eletre, the boys and girls based in Dieppe are introducing this–the A390_β. It's only a concept at this stage but a production version will follow next year.
Just like Ferrari is refusing to call the Purosangue an SUV, Alpine doesn't use the acronym. Instead, it's a ""sport fastback."" The sloping roofline gives the impression of an SUV that had an affair with a coupe. Because this is only a concept, the Renault-owned marque can get away with not giving the A390_β a conventional B-pillar. However, that won't be the case with the subsequent road-going model. In addition, the suicide doors won't make it to production either.
Although the concept does look more exciting than your typical SUV, logic tells us the actual vehicle people will be able to buy won’t match this level of pizzazz. There is hope, though. Alpine does promise the final car will retain around 85% of the exterior design but we'll believe it when we'll see it.
The futuristic interior is said to take after Formula 1 cars but obviously with a lot more seats. The A390 is touted as a five-seater version of the future electric A110 sports car. It's the one Alpine initially planned to develop with Lotus before the two parted ways in mid-2023.
Technical specifications are limited at this point but we do know the production model will feature three electric motors. One will sit at the front and the other two at the back, enabling all-wheel drive. It won’t be a permanent AWD setup, which suggests the front-mounted motor can be decoupled for a more tail-happy experience. Active torque vectoring is promised for a more engaging drive.
The A390 will be the second EV from Alpine, following the A290 hot hatchback. The latter is essentially a high-performance version of the reborn Renault 5. Although Alpine is coming to the United States in a couple of years, you won’t see these electric vehicles in North America. Instead, bigger SUVs are expected to get a US visa. There are also plans for an A310 coupe, a bigger four-seat sports car to take on the Porsche 911 but with an electric setup.
By the end of the decade, Alpine intends to have no fewer than seven EVs in its growing lineup. A supercar was recently confirmed and it'll either be entirely electric or will feature a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine.

This Alpine Supercar Has A Hydrogen V-6 Engine,https://insideevs.com/news/737308/alpine-supercar-hydrogen/,The Alpenglow Hy6 concept uses a twin-turbo 3.5-liter engine that makes serious horsepower.,2024-10-14 09:40:07,"Much like Toyota, Alpine thinks the combustion engine can be saved by making it run on hydrogen. While the Japanese automaker has been experimenting with GR Yaris and GR Corolla hot hatches with three-cylinder engines, Renault's performance division started with a four-cylinder unit. Now, it’s displaying a supercar concept with an even bigger V-6.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is an evolution of the Alpenglow Hy4 we saw a few months ago. The previous car was a running prototype of the 2022 Alpenglow, a static concept. Gone is the turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine with 340 horsepower since it's made way for a 3.5-liter V-6 with a pair of turbos. It belts out 730 hp and 568 lb-ft (770 Nm) delivered to the rear axle.
Renault's performance arm says it engineered the six-cylinder engine to run on hydrogen and linked it to a sequential transmission. The V-6 revs to 9,000 rpm and feeds on hydrogen stored in three tanks. Two are mounted in the side pods while the third one sits behind the cockpit. All three tanks are placed in ventilated compartments, and for safety reasons, don't share anything with the cabin.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is motivated by a completely new V-6 that took two years to develop. It uses an aluminum block with a dry sump and produces 211 hp per liter. The mid-mounted combustion engine is nestled in an LMP3 carbon chassis and enables the supercar to exceed 205 mph (330 km/h) with zero emissions. There is an Inconel exhaust system built into the taillights but its role is to release water vapor.
Alpine has confirmed plans to put a supercar in production but it’s unclear whether it’ll have a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine or a fully electric drivetrain. In the meantime, the French brand is gearing up to make its debut in the United States in a couple of years.
Alpine is displaying the Alpenglow Hy6 at the 2024 Paris Motor Show together with the A290 electric hot hatch as a performance version of the new Renault 5. In addition, the A390 concept is also there ahead of next year when the production model will become the company's first SUV. In addition, the limited-run A110 R Ultime special edition is also in the City of Lights this week as the brand's most expensive car ever.

"Lamborghini's EV Will Be A Big Seller, Says CEO",https://www.motor1.com/news/736579/lamborghini-ev-sales-expectations-ceo-interview/,Lamborghini's first EV won't be a sports car. But CEO Stephan Winkelmann expects it to sell as well as the Temerario.,2024-12-25 08:50:10,"Lamborghini is planning to release its first electric vehicle in 2028. Previewed by the Lanzador concept shown at Pebble Beach in 2023, it'll be a funky SUV-shaped 2+2 grand tourer, rather than a sports car. CEO Stephan Winkelmann predicts the EV will sell as well as the company's mainstream supercar, despite the public's diminishing interest in battery-powered cars.
Speaking with Motor1 at the launch of the Urus SE at the Nardò Technical Center in Italy, Winkelmann laid out the expected volumes of Lamborghini's lineup following the launch of its EV.
""The Revuelto is in the smallest segment, the volumes will always be the smallest,"" he told Motor1. ""And then we see Temerario and the [electric] GT car more or less on the same level. And the Urus will always be the biggest seller.""
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept at Monterey Car Week
The Temerario, released earlier this year, is Lamborghini's new entry-level supercar, replacing the hugely successful Huracán. The Italian manufacturer sold 3962 Huracáns last year, representing about 40 percent of all sales. It's probably a safe bet to assume Temerario sales will follow suit.
Winkelmann's claim on Lamborghini's EV volume is a bold prediction, then, considering the public's shifting attitude away from electric cars, even at the ultra-luxury level. But Lamborghini isn't concerned about today's demand.
""You need to think about that Lamborghini needs five years [of development], then a product cycle of at least eight years,"" Winkelmann says. ""So you always have to look into what is going to happen in the future. Because if you measure yourself on the mood of the day, you will never do anything.""
Winkelmann isn't the only one betting on Lamborghini's EV success. In a separate interview with Motor1, chief technical officer Rouven Mohr says it's only a matter of when, not if, sentiments will change. And Lamborghini won't rely on simulated gear shifts and fake engine sounds to sell cars, but rather something more.
""From our perspective, we need to go a step further,"" Mohr says. ""Only trying to imitate a combustion engine is probably the right answer for now. But we have to convince the customers that the electric driving experience is something more than you cannot have in the combustion world. Only then can you convince emotional buyers to stay electric.""

Skoda Desperately Tried To Make An Electric SUV Cool (And It Kinda Works),https://www.motor1.com/news/736710/skoda-enyaq-electric-rally-car-concept/,"Can we get an Ioniq 5 N? No, we have one at home. The Ioniq 5 N at home:",2024-12-25 08:50:12,"We love Skoda, don't we folks? The century-old Czech automaker always has some interesting forbidden fruit that we can only admire from across the pond. This year, leveraging its history in motorsport, Skoda built a pretty badass rally car based on one of its otherwise unassuming electric SUVs. This is the Skoda Enyaq RS Race concept.
Designed and built by Skoda Motorsport, the race division took a normal Enyaq EV and made it lower, wider, and lighter. Using biocomposite body panels incorporating flax fibers, and lightweight polycarbonate windows, the Enyaq RS Race is 661 pounds lighter than the standard Enyaq SUV. That puts it somewhere around 4,300 pounds in total.
The concept sits 2.8 inches lower than the standard Enyaq, and is 2.8 inches wider at the front and 4.6 inches wider at the rear. It ditches the production dynamic chassis control suspension for a race-ready sports suspension with individual adjustments for the spring stiffness, compression, and rebound.
Visually, the Enyaq RS Race gets an aggressive aero kit with various vents and wings. It has a new lip spoiler and a larger grille opening for better cooling up front, a sizable spoiler in the rear for added downforce, and even a functioning ​​NACA duct that channels air into the interior. Even the custom 20-inch wheels were designed to improve aerodynamics.
Two electric motors and an 82.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack power the concept, giving it 335 horsepower. Thanks to its generous weight loss, the Enyaq RS Concept will hit 62 miles per hour in less than five seconds, but it has the same 112-mph top speed as its production counterpart.
Just like a real rally car, Skoda Motorsport actually stripped the Enyaq’s interior. It now has a roll cage, a handbrake lever, an emergency fire extinguisher switch, safety foam panels, and instead of the traditional rack-and-pinion steering, this concept has linear steering with adjustable steering weight—as well as a new race-ready steering wheel. Don’t worry, Skoda kept the 13.0-inch touchscreen.
Will you ever be able to buy one of these? Unlikely. But it’s an interesting exercise in what’s possible for Skoda Motorsport moving forward. Johannes Neft, a Skoda Auto Board Member for Technical Development, says that the company is ""trialing [the biocomposite parts] in motorsport,"" and that they may use the material in ""future implementation.""
Either way, it’s awesome.

Lamborghini: Now's Not The Time For An Electric Supercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/736449/lamborghini-says-no-to-ev-supercar/,"Lamborghini's entire lineup is now hybridized. But releasing an EV sports car would still be the wrong move, says CTO Rouven Mohr.",2024-12-25 08:50:13,"About five years ago, Lamborghini decided to hybridize its entire lineup, forgoing the move to pure electrification. At the time, introducing pure EVs—not hybrids—seemed like the only path forward, with legislation and public pressure coming down on manufacturers. But that pressure has since reversed course, with electric car sales faltering and governments walking back aggressive EV mandates.
With demand for extravagant, high-displacement ICE cars greater than ever, it's clear Lamborghini's gamble has paid off. Chief technical officer Rouven Mohr says even now, an all-electric supercar from the brand wouldn't succeed.
""At the moment, now, the time would not be right [for an EV], at least not in a super sports car,"" Mohr told Motor1 at the Nardò Technical Center during the launch of the Urus SE. ""You have seen a lot of [electric] cars on the market that were not really successful.""
Lamborghini Terzo Millennio Concept
With its lineup fully hybridized, Lamborghini has put itself in the perfect position for success. All three of its models—the V-12-powered Revuelto, the twin-turbo Temerario, and the Urus SUV—now feature some kind of electric assistance, placing the brand in the ideal spot as competitors lag behind.
""I'm super happy with our current lineup, because with a hybridized lineup, we can live for the next decade,"" Mohr told Motor1. ""But I also believe Lamborghini needs to have the transition [to electric power], because it's only a question of time when the mindset will change.""
Lamborghini understands that time is fast approaching, which is why it plans to launch its first all-electric car in 2028. Previewed last year at Monterey with the Lanzador concept, the EV won't be a full-on supercar, but rather an SUV-shaped 2+2 grand tourer. Making it stand out amongst a sea of mostly similar-feeling EVs will be the company's biggest challenge, says Mohr.
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept
""It's about the clearness of the product, definition, staying on your brand DNA,"" he told Motor1. ""It's clear that a full electric car from Lamborghini has to have this kind of excitement factor. It's not only about maximum power, maximum acceleration. These are commodities.""
Mohr went on to say the first electric Lamborghini should have the same ""kind of roughness, a kind of excitement"" as the brand's gas-powered cars.
""You can be sure when we bring the first electric Lamborghini, we will be very careful in managing the brand's attributes,"" Mohr says. ""We are not thinking to bring another standard electric car, one megawatt of power. It's not like this. You need a differentiation.""
Lamborghini Lanzador Concept
The first (and arguably only) car that comes to mind when you think about exciting EVs is the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, thanks in part to its simulated paddle-shifted transmission. While Mohr appreciates the innovation, he doesn't think it would mesh well with the Lamborghini brand.
""I have full respect that they are addressing this point,"" Mohr says. ""For me, it's the right way to speak about emotional connection in an electric car. It's not only about acceleration, and they were the first ones that addressed it in this kind of way.
""If you asked me if [the simulated gears] are fitting to the Lamborghini brand, not so much,"" Mohr says. ""From our perspective, we need to go a step further. Only trying to imitate a combustion engine is probably the right answer for now. But we have to convince the customers that the electric driving experience is something more than you cannot have in the combustion world. Only then can you convince emotional buyers to stay electric.""
It's not clear exactly what that differentiator will be for Lamborghini. With just four years to go until the EV's launch, we won't have to wait very long to find out.

"Watch Koenigsegg, Hennessey, And Rimac CEOs Drive Each Other's Cars",https://www.motor1.com/news/736235/koenigsegg-hennessey-rimac-ceos-drive-competitors/,Mate Rimac said the Koenigsegg Jesko Attack needs 'a little less traction control.',2024-12-25 08:50:15,"Koenigsegg, Rimac, and Hennessey are big names in the hypercar arena. The companies make cars that push the boundaries of engineering and physics, and it’s not often we see their CEOs behind the wheel of their competitors, but Top Gear magazine assembled the three bosses and three of their cars at Sonoma Raceway to see what each thought of the other’s cars.
The three vehicles—Hennessy Venom F5 Revolution, Rimac Nevera, and Koenigsegg Jesko Attack—are pinnacles of performance, with the weakest one still making 1,600 horsepower, about 200 less than the other two.
John Hennessey was the first to go, hopping in the Koenigsegg. He called it a “little intimidating” when the coach started to dial back the traction control, saying, “A car like this should be outrageous.”
Mate Rimac then hopped into the Venom F5 for a spin, calling it a “monster engine in a go-kart. It’s crazy.” Christian von Koenigsegg then drove the Rimac, and he walked away impressed. “It’s very nice, very predictable, very easy to drive. Fun. Powerful,” he said with a smile before taking the Hennessey for a spin.
The video ends with Rimac driving Koenigsegg around the track in the Nevera as the two discuss physics. Part two should be more revealing, as the three debrief from the track session and hopefully get more candid about their competitors.

The Mercedes-AMG C63 Should've Been An EV,https://www.motor1.com/features/736240/mercedes-c63-amg-ev-opinion/,"Huge on tech and thrust, but low on charisma, the C63 can’t match its raucous predecessors. A C63 EV could’ve at least tried.",2024-12-25 08:50:16,"I’m loath to pile on the 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63, because it seems Mercedes already can’t sell the things. But here we are. This latest UberMerc isn’t a bad car by any objective measure, but if we search our feelings as Vader once instructed, we know it to be true: The new C63 is not a great car either.
That’s a shame because every C63 that came before was great. Never a match for the BMW M3’s lap times or the Audi RS4’s visual presence, the C63 traded on attitude. AMG picked a shade of growling Stathamesque charisma and poured it on by the bucketload.
When a C63 rolled by, it left an impression. ""Now there’s a car for a man with a scar on his face,"" you’d think. While I remember almost nothing about the last generations of M3 and Audi RS, I’ll never shake the memory of a twin-turbo C63 drifting wide up a Tennessee hairpin before swinging past the next apex. Even after it disappeared, you could hear that AMG mill wailing up the hillside for a country mile.
That’s what the C63 badge means. Why would Mercedes change the recipe?
Welcome to Kinardi Line, mouthpiece of the free world’s most curious auto writer. Home to questionable takes, quiet revelations, and shitbox worship.
We’ll never get a straight answer. But surely the decision was driven by the EU’s efficiency demands, rather than an authentic tie to the Mercedes F1 program, some cogent business case, or as it was in the days when former CEO Tobias Moers ran AMG, genuine knuckle-dragger enthusiasm.
Determined not to give us the V-8, Mercedes delivered the C63 with a compact inline-four turbo mated to some motors and batteries. By all accounts, it’s a technical masterpiece. Our writer Chris Rosales did a lovely tech breakdown of the powertrain here, and it’s funny that reading about the C63’s technology can impart a sense of awe, but the driving experience doesn’t.
This hybrid C63 will simply stomp on almost anything it locks horns with, including the older generations, but it’s woefully heavy and dull to drive in context of the car’s own history. So rather than beat this C63’s lack of emotional appeal like the dead horse it is, let’s make a different case.
Since Mercedes either can't or won't give us another V-8 brawler, the new C63 should’ve been an EV.
First, a practical argument: Mercedes moved metaphorical mountains to cram both a snorty turbo four and a plug-in hybrid system into the current C-Class.
Fallout from those packaging decisions means you just can’t fit much of anything inside this mid-size sedan. My son’s stroller, for example, won’t fit in the C63’s trunk. That’s unacceptable.
That dearth of space comes courtesy of the hybrid system’s 196-pound, 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which sits above the rear axle. It’s a small battery by modern standards, but one that deducts a huge amount of vertical trunk space. Trunk volume drops less than three cubic feet, from 12.6 to 9.8 cubes, but most of that space is lost by the trunk floor raising to accommodate the battery.
It means you can’t squeeze a folded-up stroller inside the trunk, which in turn means you have to wedge that stroller and its soggy, dirty wheels behind the driver’s seat and whoops there’s wet clay and grass over your gorgeous leather interior. To stick with a turbo-four plug-in hybrid, Mercedes sacrificed practicality on the altar of performance. But did they have to?
The Bavarians offer a counterpoint. Take the BMW i4, which sat in my driveway just a week earlier than the Benz. In M50 guise, the i4 hits 60 mph in a scant 3.3 seconds. That nearly matches the Mercedes’s frankly batshit 2.9-second time, but by the quarter-mile mark, the cars are neck and neck. The Bimmer’s a half-second behind but with the same trap speed.
While the straight-line performance of the two cars is close-but-not-equal, it’s a dead heat on the skidpad (right around 1.00 g). But, the i4 is massively more spacious on the inside, offering an airier cabin for drivers and passengers, plus seven more cubic feet of cargo volume (thanks to a fastback design), while the i4 has smaller measurements in every exterior dimension.
Cargo space isn’t the sexiest thing to hang an argument on, but we expect practicality even from our super sedans. If the C63 aims to deliver so much performance with so little emotion— weighed down by an EV’s curb weight and far more mechanical complexity—it begs the question, what if the C63 were an EV instead?
Mercedes’s EV lineup could use the excitement. Its current EV spread consists of some of the most dour and uninspired sedans in the segment. The EQE is a prime example. It’s designed both inside and outside to look sleek and inoffensive, a coated aspirin gel on wheels. If only its detached driving dynamics could dull the pain of its forgettable design.
A C63 EV could’ve jolted Mercedes’s electric lineup to life. Instead of adhering to the same low-drag mold that half of the market’s EV sedans seemingly slip from, imagine walking from the grocery store doors and seeing a C63, but this one happens to be an EV. Imagine that car’s Lucid-conquering performance, the presence of its brutish visual charm, but without having to explain what the hell is a Lucid Air?! at the neighborhood pickleball tournament.
In an era when every single Mercedes EV beyond the G-Class looks anonymous, the C63’s design still evokes the best of Mercedes-AMG’s ideals. It’s quiet but confident, elegant but menacing, and compelling in all the ways you expect the most-badass C-Class to be. The BMW i4 proves that a C-Class-shaped midsize sedan could accommodate batteries and increase livability for its passengers, as well as nailing the performance prerequisites.
Would a synthetic V-8 rumbling through the speakers sound better than the C63s anodyne soundtrack? Maybe. Or maybe not. But at least you could keep your C63’s interior from getting smeared by muddy stroller tires and, well, it couldn’t sound worse than an EQE.",Kyle Kinard
Renault Made A Hydrogen Wagon With A Rechargeable Battery,https://www.motor1.com/news/736142/renault-embleme-hydrogen-wagon-concept/,The rear-wheel-drive Emblème is a hybrid but not the usual type.,2024-12-25 08:50:17,"Renault wants to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2040 and all over the world just 10 years later. To get there, it's doubling down on battery-powered electric vehicles while insisting there's still a future for hydrogen cars. Dubbed as a demo car, the Emblème is actually both. Much like the new Honda CR-V e:FCEV, it combines a hydrogen fuel cell with a rechargeable battery pack.
The French marque calls it a shooting brake although some would argue it has too many doors. Body style aside, the Emblème is an aero-driven concept with a drag coefficient of only 0.25. It looks substantially different than the regular production models and we're hoping some of its design cues will rub off on road-going vehicles. The Emblème is large for a concept described as a compact car, at 189 inches (4.8 meters) long but only 59.9 inches (1.52 meters) tall, giving it a sleek profile.
Renault claims the Emblème can cover up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) ""as rapidly as an ICE vehicle."" That quote assumes two stops to juice up the 2.8-kilogram hydrogen tank, provided you'll find refueling stations considering there were roughly 1,000 globally at the end of last year. Each stop takes less than five minutes and a full tank lasts for 217 miles (350 kilometers). In town, the low-slung wagon behaves like a battery-powered EV courtesy of a 40-kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) pack.
Doing the math, a full battery charge should last for 187 miles (300 kilometers) considering that by making two stops for hydrogen, a driver can cover 434 miles (700 kilometers). The Emblème is rear-wheel drive by featuring a 215-horsepower motor mounted at the back. This wound-rotor electric motor doesn't use any rare earths.
Although it has a complex powertrain, the Emblème is not as heavy as most traditional hybrids or EVs. Renault touts a curb weight of 3,858 pounds (1,750 kilograms) after the engineers ""hunted down every superfluous kilogram."" All these efforts have been made to ensure the striking wagon is as much eco-friendly as possible. Emissions ""from the cradle to the grave"" were slashed by 90% compared to similarly sized car.
The concept car will be publicly displayed at the 2024 Paris Motor Show between October 14-20 when we're hoping to see the interior as well.

The Mercedes-AMG One PHEV Broke Its Own Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/735878/amg-one-new-nurburgring-record/,"With a lap time of 6:29.09, the AMG One beat its previous record by several seconds.",2024-12-25 08:50:19,"As it stands, it seems there's just one (get it?) car that can beat the Mercedes-AMG One's lap record at the Nürburgring. Yes, another AMG One. The old record established on October 28, 2022, by Mercedes‑AMG brand ambassador Maro Engel is no longer valid. That's only because he managed to improve it by several seconds.
On September 23, 2024, the DTM driver crossed the finish line in 6 minutes and 29.09 seconds. That's quite an improvement over the previous record of 6 minutes 35.18 seconds. For the sake of clarity, we're talking about the longer 12.92-mile (20.83-kilometer) configuration of the Green Hell. The AMG One is now the first street-legal production car to dip below the 6:30 mark.
Mercedes doesn't list the lap time around the shorter 12.8-mile (20.6-kilometer) layout but the hot lap from 2022 was done in 6 minutes and 30.7 seconds. As to why the three-pointed star decided to give it another whirl, it knew there was room for improvement. In the previous attempt, the track conditions were not ideal as some sections of the challenging circuit were damp.
AMG obliterated its own record during Maro Engel's third timed lap on a dry Nordschleife with 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) measured on the asphalt and 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) in the air. These were ideal conditions to beat the already impressive performance from nearly two years ago. The AMG One completed the lap at 6:56 PM.
We can't think of too many cars that could put the AMG One's lap record in jeopardy. The Aston Martin Valkyrie is one of them and maybe the upcoming McLaren W1. We're also adding the LaFerrari successor as a potential threat. We're ruling out the Red Bull RB17 because it’s a track-only machine. The same goes for the Lotus Evija X despite its 6:24 lap.
Maybe the influx of electric hypercars could rise to the challenge, but with the Nürburgring being so long, we wouldn't hold our breath. Perhaps Rimac can prove us wrong with the new Nevera R. With the Mission X, Porsche said it would conquer the 'Ring but a production version has not been announced yet.
It's hard to imagine a car that will ever beat the overall record established by the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo in 2018 when racing driver Timo Bernhard lapped the 'Ring in a mind-boggling 5 minutes and 19.5 seconds. An honorable mention goes to the electric Volkswagen ID.R driven by Romain Dumas to a 6:05 lap in 2019.

Here's An Early Look At The Electric Jeep Compass,https://www.motor1.com/news/736343/next-gen-jeep-compass-teaser/,The crossover will also be offered with hybrid and traditional combustion engines.,2024-12-25 08:50:20,"Despite being eight years old, the Jeep Compass is still going strong. With 84,474 units delivered in the United States through September 2024, demand is up by 18% compared to the first nine months of last year. A next-generation model is coming, but you'll have to wait. Released today, the first teaser signals the crossover's world premiere in Europe next September.
The adjacent design sketch comes along with news about the Compass going fully electric by switching to the STLA Medium platform. Don't worry–there will still be versions with combustion engines, including traditional ICE and hybrid setups. Jeep calls it the company's ""most globally available model,"" so it wants to make sure there will be a flavor of the crossover for all tastes.
The new Compass will initially hit the assembly line at Stellantis' Melfi in Italy next year before production expands to North America and other regions in 2026. In the US, the next-generation crossover will be positioned above an all-new Renegade and below the Recon as well as a mysterious ""new mainstream utility vehicle."" All three are coming by 2027, according to a product roadmap released back in June.
Meanwhile, the teaser hints at evolutionary styling with quite possibly a different take on the quarter glass. The new Compass appears to be slightly bigger judging by the distance between the C and D rear pillars. Several Stellantis products are already on the STLA Medium platform, namely the Peugeot 3008 and 5008 as well as the Opel Grandland and forthcoming next-gen Citroën C5 Aircross.
The E-3008 is the first Stellantis product on this platform, offering up to 435 miles of range on a single charge. Peugeot's electric crossover comes in front- and all-wheel-drive configurations with single- and dual-motor setups, respectively. It's offered with 73- and 98-kWh battery packs that can take 160-kW DC charging.
Expect Jeep's version to have a lot in common with its European cousins.

The Honda Prologue Surprised Me: Review,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/735639/2024-honda-prologue-review/,The Prologue is a prime example of when badge engineering goes very right.,2024-12-25 08:50:21,"Rebadging is just part of the business. When two disparate companies want to share technologies or save costs, they team up to build similar vehicles with different badges, and market each one to their respective audiences. And apart from a few outliers (remember the Aston Martin Cygnet?), modern rebadging usually proves successful for both brands.
The problem with badge engineering though, is that sometimes the two products are too similar. They share virtually everything: Powertrains, technology, dynamics, etc. The only differences are the way they look and the badges on their backsides. With the Prologue, I was worried Honda’s new EV would feel too much like a Chevy—and in many ways, it does. But in this case, that's actually a good thing.
GM's Ultium platform is excellent. Underneath the Prologue's stylish sheet metal, it's basically a Chevrolet Blazer EV with a few tweaks. It has an 85.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack and two electric motors on this all-wheel-drive Elite trim, for a total output of 288 horsepower and 333 pound-feet of torque, and 273 miles of range. The single-motor, front-drive variant gets 296 miles of range.
As with most electric crossovers in this class, the Prologue is unremarkable in a straight line. Acceleration is quick and immediate, and mid-range power is decent, but it tapers off when you get up to highway speeds. Tick over to Sport mode if you want the throttle to feel a bit snappier.
Handling isn't really this Honda's forte, either. Senior Editor Chris Perkins described the steering as “gloopy,” and I agree. The steering ratio feels quick at first but doesn't add feedback as the steering angle increases. It's a strangely dull car to steer. In Sport mode, the steering effort feels just… heavier.
One thing Honda did improve over the Blazer is ride quality. With specific springs and dampers, the Prologue is phenomenally comfortable. It glides over bumps with ease and quickly smooths out broken pavement. Even with its hefty 5,273-pound curb weight and too-big 21-inch wheels on this Elite model, the Prologue rides better than some lighter ICE alternatives.
The cabin is absolutely serene. Excellent sound dampening keeps wind and tire noise at bay, which means sitting in the Prologue—even at highway speeds—is whisper quiet. Leather seats come standard on the mid-range Touring and above—and they are super comfy. And 10-way power adjustability with lumbar support is standard across the board. I had no issue quickly getting settled in the driver's seat.
The second row feels massive. There's a ton of legroom and ample headroom, more than enough for my six-foot-tall self to sit comfortably within for long periods. The Prologue has 39.4 inches of legroom and 36.7 inches of headroom on this Elite trim (the base Prologue has 38.1 inches of headroom), which aren't the best figures in the class, but competitive. The 23.8 cubic feet behind the second row are plenty capacious too, and that expands to 54.6 cubic feet with the second row folded flat.
The Prologue's 11.3-inch touchscreen and 11.0-inch digital instrument cluster run an Android-based infotainment system that's identical to what's in most modern Chevy models. That's not a bad thing. The crisp graphics, clean interface, and smartphone-quick touch responsiveness are a marked improvement over the otherwise outdated system found in Honda's ICE cars. And it still has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which works well.
There is one interesting ‘quirk’ to this system though: There’s no physical headlight switch. There’s a barely noticeable headlight toggle on the upper lefthand corner of the touchscreen, or you can do what I did and dig into five layers of screens before reaching the headlight interface. For what it’s worth, the headlights work perfectly fine on auto.
Every Prologue is equipped with Honda’s robust Sensing safety suite, which includes a forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and more. Upgrading to the OnStar Data package unlocks traffic sign recognition, and only on this Elite model do you get a rear pedestrian alert and a 360-degree overhead camera.
Starting at $48,795 for a base EX model with front-wheel drive, the Prologue isn’t the cheapest option in the segment by a long shot. That honor goes to the Ford Mustang Mach-E at $42,985 (and it has standard rear-wheel drive). For the Prologue Elite, prepare to dish out at least $59,295 before options. The $455 Sonic Gray Pearl brings the as-tested price to $59,750.
That’s a pretty penny to pay for a badge-engineered Honda. Thankfully, GM’s Ultium platform makes the Prologue an excellent proposition thanks to its serene ride, sumptuous cabin, and superb powertrain. And for my money, it looks better than the Blazer.

AMG Boss Is Confident V-8 Buyers Will Switch To Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/735838/amg-confident-v8-buyers-switch-ev/,"The CEO says people have bought cars with eight cylinders not just for the engine, but also the technology.",2024-12-25 08:50:23,"After learning that AMG buyers will embrace four-cylinder hybrids like smartphones, the man in charge of Mercedes' performance division follows up with an equally controversial statement. Speaking with Britain's Autocar magazine, AMG CEO Michael Schiebe was highly confident that buyers will have no problems switching from a big ol' V-8 engine to electric.
""Customers who came to the brand because of the V-8 did not come because they just wanted to have a big engine. They came because they loved the technology that we put into the car. So when it comes to electric driving, I'm pretty sure they will jump into that new technology because it will be the latest and greatest that you can get.""
The gist of this statement is that AMG wants us to believe Affalterbach's clientele consists of people who prioritize technology. If the latest developments don't have a combustion engine, customers will apparently transition to EVs. Sooner or later, the ""one man, one engine philosophy"" will come to an end, and it looks as though Schiebe believes people won't hesitate to embrace EVs as long as it has the newest tech.
But the V-8 engine isn't dying anytime soon. AMG has promised it still has new eight-cylinder models in the works. A recent spy video indicates the CLE63 could be the next in line to get the V-8 treatment. Reports state that the top-tier CLE was supposed to have a downsized electrified powertrain but weak demand for the C63 has prompted AMG to change the engine late in the development stage.
Although exact sales figures for the C63 are not available, massive discounts in Germany indicate it's not exactly popular. The C63 is not the only AMG to lose its V-8 since the GLC63 has also dropped the twin-turbo 4.0-liter unit. In addition, Mercedes has already announced the next E63 won't have eight cylinders.
Referring to the plug-in hybrid 2.0-liter setup in a previous interview, Schiebe admitted some AMG customers ""take time to really be excited for the technology."" He went on to say that ""it's important to be open-minded when it comes to technology."" Looking further back, Schiebe defended the company's decision to put a four-banger in the C63 by saying its plug-in hybrid setup is ""very, very progressive.""
In AMG's defense, it is putting money where its mouth is. Not only has it launched several high-performance PHEVs, but it's also developing a bespoke electric car platform. The AMG.EA architecture has been several years in the making and Autocar understands a purely electric supercar is in the works. It'll apparently take after last year's Vision One-Eleven concept and should serve as a spiritual successor to the quad-motor 2013 SLS AMG Electric Drive.
AMG has already ruled out doing another F1-powered hypercar to follow up on the One because of increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Lower in the vast Mercedes lineup, there are still plenty of six- and eight-cylinder models, and even a massive V-12 in the Maybach S-Class.
Generally speaking, there's still time to buy a car with the right amount of cylinders but there are fewer and fewer options.

Caterham's Electric Sports Car Will Get Its Power From An Unlikely Source,https://www.motor1.com/news/735830/yamaha-power-caterham-sports-car/,The rear-wheel-drive electric coupe will fight the next Porsche Cayman.,2024-12-25 08:50:23,"Remember the Caterham Project V? The electric concept car debuted last year at the Goodwood Festival of Speed with an impressively low curb weight of 2,623 pounds. But it was more than just a one-and-done exercise; The niche British brand has real plans to launch a production model. And now we know who will power the electric coupe: Yamaha
The concept is now evolving into a prototype engineered by Japanese firm Tokyo R&D. It will be powered by a Yamaha electric powertrain, and should be completed by the middle of next year, with series production expected to commence at some point in 2026. Caterham doesn't go into details about Yamaha's electric motor, but the original Project V concept was rear-wheel drive with 268 horsepower on tap.
The show car from Goodwood had a 2+1 layout but an optional 2+2 configuration was mentioned. Caterham touted a 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and a top speed of 143 mph. The coupe's 55.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery had enough juice for 249 miles in the optimistic WLTP cycle. The concept supported DC charging at 150 kilowatts for a 20% to 80% charge in around 15 minutes.
Because concepts are typically diamonds in the rough, Caterham borrowed bits and pieces from other cars to speed up the Project V's development without compromising quality. Examples include Maserati seats and the Audi TT's door aperture. Some readily available parts will be installed in the road-going model to cut costs.
Even though it never built its own car, Yamaha is no stranger to the automotive industry. It teased us with a Miata rival in the mid-2010s that never went into production. Going further back, it helped Toyota develop the 2000GT in the 1960s before engineering and manufacturing Ford's V-6 SHO and V-8 SHO.
Perhaps the most well-known effort in the car world was Yamaha’s involvement in the Lexus LFA and its naturally aspirated V-10. The list goes on with a V-8 for Volvo as well as four-cylinder engines for the Toyota Celica, MR2, and the Lotus Elise. There was also the pint-sized Motiv concept and the aborted 1992 OX99-11 supercar that was supposed to go into production a couple of years later with a roaring V-12.
Yamaha hasn't completely abandoned ICE technology. Recent efforts have included a golf cart and a buggy modified to run on a hydrogen-burning combustion engine.

Alpine Is Working On A New Supercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/735741/alpine-new-electric-supercar-confirmed/,It’s probably going to be electric.,2024-12-25 08:50:33,"Even though we don't get the Alpine brand in America, we can still fawn over the no-nonsense A110 sports car from abroad. The Porsche Cayman competitor makes 252 horsepower and weighs a scant 2,429 pounds—and it sounds like an absolute blast to drive. But Alpine is working on something even more powerful, the problem is, it probably won't have the same lightweight qualities as its little brother.
According to Autocar, Alpine is opening a new research and development facility at its Viry-Chatillon Formula 1 engine production site dubbed ""Hypertech Alpine."" The R&D base will be home to all things electric for the Alpine brand moving forward, including a new performance car currently referred to as the ""Future Alpine Supercar."" Clever.
""Creating this Hypertech Alpine center is key to Alpine's development strategy and, more broadly, to the group's innovation strategy,"" said Alpine CEO Philippe Krief. ""It is a turning point in the history of the Viry-Châtillon site, which will ensure the continuity of a savoir-faire and the inclusion of its rare skills in the group's ambitious future while strengthening Alpine's position as an 'innovation garage.'""
The yet-to-be-named vehicle will be built alongside an electric A110 and reportedly use Alpine's new future solid-state battery packs designed for ""extreme operating conditions for supercar-type applications."" It will also adopt ultra-efficient electric motors jointly developed with Ampere—Renault's new EV and software sub-brand.
Visually, the new supercar should look similar to the Alpenglow Hy4 hypercar concept the company debuted back in May. Alpine design chief Antony Villain told Autocar that the concept was developed with a production car ""in mind"".
It should be noted, though, that Alpine hasn’t outright confirmed that its next performance vehicle will be electric. All signs simply point to battery power. With a new A110 EV on the way and the brand’s breakthroughs in battery and electric motor technology, Alpine will likely want to showcase that technology in an all-electric supercar.
But who knows, maybe one of those leftover Formula 1 engines finds its way underhood. It’s not like they’ll need them after 2025 anyway.

No One Is Buying The New Fiat 500,https://www.motor1.com/news/735737/fiat-500-production-stopped/,Stellantis has halted production of the tiny city car until November 1 over poor demand.,2024-12-25 08:50:34,"Things aren't looking great for Stellantis. Sales for the company's Dodge and Jeep brands in America are cratering, and its overseas brands aren't doing much better. Adding to the bad news, Stellantis announced today it will extend its suspension of production for the all-electric Fiat 500 until November 1 over low demand.
The company originally stopped production of the 500 on September 12, planning to idle the car's Mirafiori, Italy plant for four weeks. Now, that stoppage has been extended by another three weeks.
The decision, Reuters reports, comes alongside a statement given to trade unions claiming the electric car market in Europe is ""in deep trouble.""
Despite the production halt, the Fiat 500 is far from dead. Stellantis plans to invest over $110 million into the car in the next two years, funding the development of a gas-powered hybrid version that'll arrive next year, reversing course on a purely electric lineup to account for waning demand.
For some context, Stellantis sold just 470 Fiat 500s in America in the first half of 2024. In 2012—its best year of sales—the company moved 46,999 examples of the last-gen 500. Even in 2020, after the car had been discontinued for North America, Stellantis still managed to sell 674 units.
The lack of demand makes sense, at least for the US. The 500e gets just 149 miles of range and starts at $34,095. It doesn't take a degree in mathematics to realize those numbers don't make sense for American car buyers. For the same price, you can buy an electric Hyundai Kona with way more space and 120 miles of extra range. The Fiat just isn't competitive.
Adding a gas-powered trim is a step in the right direction, but it might be too little, too late for Stellantis, judging by all the other bad news coming from the brand lately. Hopefully the company finds its way out of the hole it's dug for itself.

Volvo Still Wants Europe To Ban Sales Of New Gas Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/735667/volvo-wants-new-gas-car-ban/,The CEO argues that going purely electric is the best way to cut emissions.,2024-12-25 08:50:35,"Volvo was among the first legacy automakers to announce the gradual demise of its combustion engines. As early as the beginning of 2021, it promised to go purely electric by the end of the decade. That's not happening anymore, but the Swedes insist Europe should still ban sales of new cars with gas engines by 2035.
Bloomberg got a hold of a declaration signed by Volvo and 49 other companies urging the European Union not to change the target. According to CEO Jim Rowan, the most efficient measure the automotive industry can take to reduce emissions on the continent is to ban sales of new ICE cars: ""Electrification is the single biggest action our industry can take to cut its carbon footprint.""
Volvo is not the only automaker on that shared declaration as Rivian also wants the EU to stick to its plan of abolishing gas and diesel cars by the middle of the next decade. Bloomberg points out other automakers refused to sign the declaration but other big names outside of the car manufacturing business did, including Uber and Ikea. Tesla isn't mentioned in the report, even though just like Rivian, it only sells EVs.
It's important to mention there's an asterisk next to that ban. The European Commission wants automakers to stop selling cars that generate harmful emissions, so ICE engines are not banned per se. In theory, that leaves the door open for new vehicles powered by combustion engines running on synthetic fuel or even hydrogen. Germany demanded this exemption, and the EC has pledged to elaborate a legal route for cars with combustion engines that run on carbon-neutral fuels to stick around after 2034.
In the meantime, Volvo has killed one important type of combustion engine and has promised to never bring it back. In late March, the last diesel car rolled off the assembly line. By 2030, plug-in hybrids with gasoline engines and purely electric vehicles are projected to account for 90-100% of total sales.
Six years from now, the Geely-owned brand believes only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models"" are still going to be around. PHEVs and EVs already represented 48% of shipments in the second quarter of the year, with Volvo estimating 50-60% for 2025.
At the beginning of the year, Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said the 2035 ban could be delayed. Earlier this month, Italy's Minister of the Environment and Energy Security declared ""the ban must be changed"" as the ""ideological vision"" has failed. Gilberto Pichetto Fratin added the proposed ban is ""absurd"" and that Europe ""needs a pragmatic vision."" His sentiments are echoed by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she believes the ban is ""self-destructive.""
Whatever happens in Europe, it will have global ramifications since the biggest players in the automotive industry develop and build cars on the continent. If a certain brand won't be allowed to sell its gas car from 2035, that company might not achieve the necessary economies of scale and could kill that ICE model globally.

VW ID. Buzz Gets A Spartan Base Model In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/735650/vw-id-buzz-base-model/,The electric minivan has steelies and unpainted bumpers.,2024-12-25 08:50:36,"Although America is only now getting the ID.Buzz, Volkswagen has been selling its retro electric minivan in Europe for several years. In a bid to make the zero-emission family hauler more attainable, there's a new Freestyle flavor serving as the entry-level trim. As you can see from images we took from the German configurator, you'll have to make some serious concessions.
The spartan-spec ID.Buzz has 18-inch steel wheels with 235/60 R18 front and 255/55 R18 rear tires. That reminds me of another electric vehicle from the VW Group built on the same MEB platform with even larger steelies. A few months ago, I was surprised to see the Audi Q4 E-Tron has a 19-inch set with glorious hubcaps. If want alloys, VW has a couple of 19-inch sets that cost around €2,500 ($2,800) more.
This Candy White color is the only one offered at no extra cost, but an optional metallic Moon Silver can be had for an additional €1,035 ($1,150). Regardless of choice, the ID.Buzz Freestyle comes with unpainted bumpers that look straight out of the 1980s. Speaking of things no longer in fashion, VW throws in those side decals for free.
The interior is predictably dreary as well with basic-looking cloth seats that look like leftovers from a base Golf Mk4. You still get that giant tablet with a 12.9-inch display and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Other goodies included as standard vary from height-adjustable front seats to dual-zone automatic climate control.
While America only gets the stretched configuration, Europeans can buy the ID. Buzz with a standard wheelbase. That's what we have here, hosting a 59-kWh battery pack between the two axles. The juice is used by a rear electric motor that produces 170 horsepower, roughly half of what you get in the sporty GTX trim level.
With 229 pound-feet of instant torque, the poor man's ID. Buzz in Europe takes 10.7 seconds to reach 62 mph and won’t go any faster than 90 mph. It's not exactly quick but that’s to be expected given a curb weight of nearly 5,300 pounds and only a single-motor setup. Once you're out of energy, it takes 24 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% using DC.
At €49,997, the Freestyle undercuts the previous base trim level (Pure) by a little over €4,000. If we do the conversion, it works out to a base price of $55,663. That makes it nearly $6,000 cheaper than the much nicer base ID.Buzz available in the US. However, it's not a fair comparison seeing as how Germans pay 19% value-added tax (VAT).
The launch of a sub-€50,000 ID. Buzz in Germany closely follows the introduction of a sub-€30,000 ID.3, the not-for-America compact electric hatchback. VW seems to be making more efforts to sell EVs in a cooling European market by launching additional attainable versions. It's probably worried about meeting fleet emissions targets, which will get even stricter in 2025, putting automakers at risk of paying massive fines if they exceed a certain threshold.

Lotus Tells Us Why the Theory 1 Concept Is So Important,https://www.motor1.com/features/735602/lotus-theory1-concept-supercar-up-close-look/,"'You can't ignore [the past], because one of the most important things we have is our heritage.'",2024-12-25 08:50:36,"Most concept cars promise to run on unicorn farts, pump out 9,000 horsepower, deliver nano-second 0-60 mph times, and even cook your dinner if you ask nicely. We’ve often thought, ""What a nice concept, it’ll never happen."" They’re show-stoppers meant to highlight something that could possibly, maybe appear one day on a family sedan. And while they’re a neat distraction from the mundanities of the 9-5, they ultimately mean very little.
The Lotus Theory 1 is not that. This concept car is an actual sign of things to come. It has toys on board that actually work, and features that could appear on future cars. When it comes to Lotus, the future is sprinkled with a dash of the past.
Ben Payne, Lotus Group Design Vice President, was in London to talk us through the company’s new baby. Payne is all too aware of how the past needs to be respected.
""You can't ignore [the past], because one of the most important things we have is our heritage. Ignore that at your peril. It's extremely important we don't just do something that looks beautiful. It needs to have some genuine story behind it—how we can explain why it does certain things, or why it looks that way,"" Payne said.
Of course, the Theory 1 is a tech-fest, but it still nods to one of Lotus’s best-known icons: the Esprit.
""It isn't a pastiche, no. For us in the creative team it was more about taking the spirit of the Esprit and imagining what that looked like 50 years ago,"" he said.
There are nods to the Esprit all over the Theory 1—from the sheer wedginess of it, to lines along its flanks, and more. Looking back to inform the future, it seems, is a luxury Payne and his team seem to enjoy rather than endure. The Lotus back catalog is full of hits, why not use some of them as inspiration? Though here, if a customer, fan, or… whoever spots that some of the old stuff is present in the mix that’s seen as an objective win. Seeing an Emeya alongside, though, shows that it’s very much an evolution of the current design direction. The present isn’t to be ignored either.
It’s fair to say that delving into the firm’s past is, perhaps, wise. The firm’s EV offerings, the Eletre SUV and Emeya sedan, have received mixed reactions. Lotus purists, the devotees of lightness, affordability, and simplicity, have been vocal online about their heft, tech, and anything else they can pick holes in. The 'simplify and add lightness' quote of old is bandied around with nauseating frequency, but the Lotus that the faithful are used to didn’t come with huge batteries, 900 hp, or (in most cases) rear seats.
Today’s Lotus, or at least the Lotus that built Theory 1, is taking a different approach:
""The subject of weight, of course, is something everyone comes back to most. You have to understand that if that's what people think about your brand, your brand is what other people say—not what you say. So it's a core part of it—we have to deliver an efficiency in terms of a balance of weight, performance, and practicality, and that's really the equation with EV[s].""
Payne explains that the lightness craved by many online can happen, but at a cost of either power, or range—finding the balance of what’s right for the brand, its direction, and customers is key. Getting it right requires, according to Payne, a new take on simplifying and adding lightness.
""Start from nothing, add the minimum. Just start from nothing, and only add what you need to see where you get to,"" Payne said.
EVs, of course, come in all shapes and sizes, but for Lotus to offer one with 1,000 metric horsepower, a target weight under 3,500 pounds, and 250 miles of range, you need to start with some chunky kit—a large battery (in this case 70.0-kilowatt-hours), motors capable of delivering serious grunt, a structure that’ll keep occupants safe (and warm), and the level of tech you’d expect from a supercar.
The Theory 1 isn’t a family car, it’s not dripping in plushness, and it’s not the sort of thing you can put a dog in the back of—largely because the back is full of pushrod suspension bits, EV running gears, and the sort of engineering solutions that will make your inner engineer contort with glee. It’s a supercar through and through.
Its seats are shaped into its carbon tub—one in the middle for the driver, and two set back on either side for their mates. The pedals and steering wheel move toward the driver silently when it’s time to go. Rather than sit on bare carbon, padding is strategically positioned, but it’s not ‘just’ padding. It’s active. The Theory 1 comes with haptic fabric.
Developed by a company called MotorSkins, the fabric can react to various inputs and change its shape depending on what you need. For example, if you change the car’s drive mode the seat will reconfigure its bolsters. If Theory 1’s myriad safety systems (it comes with plenty of that—even the same active LiDAR as the Eletre and Emeya) detect a car in your blind spot, it can theoretically give you a tap on the shoulder.
Lotus can even build buttons into the car that appear at first as flat fabric, but spring to life when needed—when you want to take a call, for example. It works with layers of fabric and air channels, which keeps it light, keeping extra tech to the minimum that Payne was talking about.
Similarly, the headrests aren’t big slabs of foam, but another technology that’s yet to be seen on a road car: 3D printed plastic. You might recognize the form of it if you’re into sneakers—the company that made it, Carbon, has been working with Adidas for years. Its 3D printed soles are springy, comfy, and look awesome. Why not use that tech as a light, aesthetically pleasing headrest? There’s even room for a set of KEF speakers in each seat so everyone can listen to their own concert as you glide along.
Smart toys are bolstered with smart materials—its glass is recycled, as is the carbon fiber that makes up its tub, and there’s a good dose of cellulose composites in its bodywork, too. The Lotus of old was a pioneer in the material space, and it looks like the Lotus of the future is carrying on with tradition.
While there have been some interested parties, Lotus isn’t going to build the Theory 1. You’ll see elements of it in future cars. It didn’t appear out of thin air, in fact, it’s been hiding out of sight for a while.
""The entire process took about two years,"" said Payne, ""some of our workstreams started without a car in mind. We were looking at material explorations, next-gen lighting modules, and that kind of stuff."" From there, a concept bloomed.
With a mix of old Lotus and new, the faithful should—hopefully—be happy with where things are pointing. Payne notes that as time goes on, and new cars are launched, things may become a little more familiar than the current EV lineup:
""We listen to the feedback, to what people say. We can't ignore the customer—ever. We're an agile enough company to listen to what people say,"" explained Payne, ""As we start making smaller vehicles, they will, from their physicality, become more as people may remember the core of the brand. And I think this is very much a brand statement the future is very much going to embrace.""",Alex Goy
Chevy: We're Not Dumb Enough To Rush The Corvette Onto The EV Bandwagon,https://www.motor1.com/news/735611/chevrolet-not-making-electric-corvette-just-because/,Chief Engineer Tony Roma said there has to be a need—and a want.,2024-12-25 08:50:38,"The E-Ray is Chevrolet's first electrified Corvette. Soon, a Corvette Zora will debut with what we’re confident will be a high-powered hybrid powertrain. But the question remains: Will the Corvette ever go fully electric? As far as Chevy is concerned, not unless the company sees a real need.
In an interview with CBS News, Corvette's new Chief Engineer, Tony Roma, said an electric Corvette would only make sense if it improved the Corvette's performance, or if customers demanded it. And as of right now, neither of those things appear to be true.
""We talk about this a lot. I talk about this with enthusiasts, my friends, other engineers,"" said Roma. ""We’re not going to apply electrification just for the sake of it. We don’t put technology on for technology’s sake, so it kind of has to earn its way in. It has to make the car better in some way that our customers are gonna respond to.""
CEO Mary Barra seconded that statement. She told CBS News: ""We’ll be guided by the consumer, but the plans we have will get us there.""
Even with EV enthusiasm waning, Chevrolet still wants its lineup to be fully electric by 2035. That would almost certainly include a battery-powered Corvette—but that’s still over 10 years off. But while a Corvette EV isn’t on the table yet, the high-powered Zora hybrid should be here as early as next year.
Spy photos and videos show the new hybrid Corvette Zora testing on the Nurburgring. The prototypes in question were spotted with yellow high-voltage stickers (mandatory on the ‘Ring for battery-powered vehicles) and design elements similar to the E-Ray. If we’re lucky, it could have more than 1,200 horsepower.

Toyota Drops Meaningless Name For Plug-In Hybrids,https://www.motor1.com/news/735224/toyota-drops-prime-name/,"The ""Prime"" nameplate is dead. From now on, Toyota will just call them plug-in hybrids. As it should be.",2024-12-25 08:50:40,"""Prime"" is dead. Toyota announced on Thursday that its naming scheme for plug-in hybrid trims of the RAV4 and Prius has been dropped. Instead, the cars will be called the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. As it should be.
The Prime name first appeared in 2017 with the introduction of the Prius Prime, based on the then-new fourth-generation Prius. The first RAV4 Prime appeared in 2019, making headlines with its combined 302 horsepower and claimed 5.5-second 0-60 time.
""The switch to the RAV4 Plug-in name is intended to help consumers more easily identify the powertrain choices among RAV4 models,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""In addition to the model naming change, the Toyota logo on the front and rear of the vehicle will no longer have a blue “halo” within.""
The Prime name might've sounded cool, but it made things tough for normal shoppers who just wanted to know what they were getting. This switch will make it far easier for people to understand the differences in powertrain offerings without having to load up Google on their phones.
Aside from the badging switch-up, the RAV4 Plug-In continues into 2025 with no changes. That means standard all-wheel drive, an estimated 42 miles of all-electric range, and a combined 38 mpg when in hybrid mode.
The 2025 Prius Plug-in Hybrid continues similarly, with the same 220 hp as last year's Prime model, 44 miles of electric driving range, and up to 52 mpg combined, depending on wheel size.

In a recent interview, Pierre Loing, Nissan's global product boss, said, ""Nismo has no specific target to go electric only.""
Loing told Top Gear magazine that EV growth has been chaotic, and ""our role as a manufacturer is to adjust."" The company is focusing on its E-Power powertrain, which uses the gasoline engine as a battery generator. Nissan launched the Qashqai E-Power in 2022, the first model to feature the new setup and any Nismo plans depend on the specific model. Over half of the Qashqai's sold in Europe have E-Power.
Nissan knows a car like the GT-R can command a far higher price for a Nismo offering than a model like the Ariya. Loing admits the Ariya isn't a cheap EV, so the price ceiling can't reach ""a super high level,"" which ultimately depends on the model. A Nismo package has to fit the product, and any expansion will need strong sales to justify its existence.
Automakers across the board are reconsidering their electric vehicle plans in the face of inconsistent growth. Many are tempering their ambitious roadmaps, pushing back EV launches while focusing on growing their hybrid lineups. It indicates how quickly consumer trends can change and how nimble automakers have had to adjust.
Loing said that if you'd asked him about the company's EV plans a few years ago, he would have ""given a different answer."" Hopefully, the next few years won't force the automaker to set a new timeline to fully electrify the Nismo line.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Gets Even Driftier,https://www.motor1.com/news/734891/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n/,A configurable Drift Mode and a handful of other upgrades join the lineup for 2025.,2024-12-25 08:50:41,"It’s been a little over a year since Hyundai took the wraps off the Ioniq 5 N. The high-performance electric crossover is entering the 2025 model year at home in South Korea with a surprisingly large number of changes. There aren't any styling tweaks since most of the work revolved around making the software better to deliver a more engaging drive.
The N Drift Optimizer that helps the Ioniq 5 N go sideways can now be configured by choosing from one of the 10 available levels of assistance. Dial it all the way up to level 10 (Pro mode) and the hot EV becomes tail-happy by minimizing the intervention of the stability control system so that drivers can ""drift more freely."" In addition, the system can now better detect suitable drift conditions, which Hyundai presumes will be only on a race track.
There's also something called Downshift Memory. Intended for track use, the function ""allows the vehicle to store commands without shifting and shift when the vehicle reaches the allowable engine revs (rpm) for downshifting."" We’ll remind you the old Kona N had a downshift memory logic system that prevented downshifting at high rpms.
Elsewhere, the artificial engine sound is automatically turned on when the launch control function is triggered. This N Active Sound+ simulates the noise of a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine as found in the Elantra N.
The 2025 Ioniq 5 N for Korea gets automatic high beams with glare-free functionality. There's also a Walk-Away Lock system that automatically locks the doors when the driver walks a certain distance away from the car. The model year change brings Vehicle to Load (V2L) so that you can use the battery's stored energy to power external devices.
Rounding off the list of novelties are the second-row safety windows and haptic warning for the steering wheel. The latter begins to vibrate to warn the driver whenever the assist systems detect a hazard.
In Korea, the 2025 Ioniq 5 N costs the equivalent of $57,600 after factoring in incentives. Meanwhile, Hyundai is putting the finishing touches on its sedan equivalent, the Ioniq 6 N.

Volvo's EVs Won't Look Like An 'Apple Mouse',https://www.motor1.com/news/734747/volvo-against-blob-car-designs/,It won't compromise style and comfort for the sake of ultra-efficient shapes.,2024-12-25 08:50:42,"Some automakers have been criticized for going overboard with aerodynamic efficiency, making their electric vehicles look like blobs. We're looking at you, Mercedes. The more slippery the shape is, the greater the distance the EV can cover. But Volvo thinks there's a limit to the amount of attention given to drag coefficiency when engineering a new model.
Speaking with the Australian magazine Drive, Volvo's Senior Manager of Exterior Design Florian Mockenhaupt said future Volvos will benefit from improved aerodynamics but cautioned that focusing primarily on aero efficiency ultimately hurts styling as well as practicality:
""It's not actually so much the aesthetics, but making a car that looks like an Apple mouse comes with a lot of other compromises. We know that our customers worship comfort, for example, very much.""
Mockenhaupt says Volvo will pursue to make its cars sleeker while keeping the design language cohesive across the lineup. Next-gen models will logically look more modern but won't be a total departure from current cars since he believes people shopping in the luxury segment prefer consistency. He argues it's a different story among mainstream automakers as some brands have cars that look entirely different while sitting next to each other in the showroom.
Mockenhaupt pledges Volvo will avoid embracing the ""same sausage, different length"" strategy some of the German competitors are still doing in 2024. There is one model in the company's lineup that's not quite like the others, primarily because it's not actually a Volvo. Yes, the EM90, a rebadged minivan that started in life as the Zeekr 009. However, its impact on Volvo's overall image is limited since the posh family hauler is only sold in China.
As reported by Automotive News, Volvo CEO Jim Rowan and Chief Commercial Officer Bjorn Annwall told dealers in the US that 10 next-gen cars or updated models will be launched within the next 24 months. Two of them will be the EX60 crossover and ES90 sedan, both of which will be EVs, plus a plug-in hybrid with a long range. These will join the recently launched EX90 and a second facelift for the XC90.
For global markets, Volvo intends to launch a next-gen car and a facelifted model annually for the next eight years. Despite initially saying it would go electric-only by 2030, the Geely-owned company is now hoping that plug-in hybrids and EVs will account for 90-100% of sales by the end of the decade.

The Electronics Company Sharp Wants To Sell Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/734364/sharp-wants-sell-cars-by-2030/,This electric minivan has solar panels and a 65-inch display.,2024-12-25 08:50:43,"Just when you thought the automotive industry couldn't possibly get more crowded, another player wants to enter the game. To make it happen, TV maker Sharp intends to work with Foxconn, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer. It's better known as one of the companies that produces the iPhone. Their first joint effort is this. Say hello to the cute LDK+.
It's an EV with an adorably boxy shape and some neat features inside and out. The people-mover started in life as Foxconn's Model C crossover before being transformed for minivan duty. Sharp made the most of that massive roof by fitting solar panels to juice up the battery or power your home. There's a separate ""storage battery” to further take advantage of bidirectional charging by serving as an energy supply in case of emergencies such as a power outage caused by a natural phenomenon.
The cavernous interior is big enough to accommodate a massive 65-inch screen and rear seats that swivel. Sharp says the LDK+ uses artificial intelligence that gathers information from home appliances to adjust the AC and screen brightness. That massive display mounted at the back is not just for play as it can be used for a mobile office.
Technical specifications remain shrouded in mystery at this point. However, we do know the 2021 concept has since evolved into a production model that's already on sale in Taiwan as the Foxtron Model C. If you're unfamiliar with the name, Foxtron is a joint venture between Luxgen's parent company Yulon and Foxconn.
The road-going SUV has 231 horsepower, 250 pound-feet of torque, and 314 miles of range, albeit in the overly optimistic New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) cycle. The EV is 184.8 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 64 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 115 inches. That said, Sharp's electric minivan has different proportions. As for weight, the Foxtron Model C tips the scales at around 4,300 pounds.
Automotive News spoke with a Sharp official about the company’s ambitions to enter the automotive realm. Kazuma Naito, software development manager at Sharp’s Next Innovation branch, said the objective is to start selling cars by 2030. He admitted that the timeframe is currently a ""loose goal.""
With Foxconn owning a 66% controlling stake in Sharp, it's no surprise the two will collaborate again to bring EVs to the market by the decade's end. In the first phase, Sharp wants to sell electric cars at home in Japan, built domestically or somewhere else by Foxconn, potentially in China.
Sharp won't be the only tech giant from the Land of the Rising Sun to enter the car business in recent years. Sony has teamed up with Honda to launch an automotive joint venture called Sony Honda Mobility to bring the Afeela electric sedan to the market in 2025. An SUV is set to follow in 2027, with a cheaper compact model believed to debut in 2028 at the earliest.
Speaking of tech companies making cars, the long-rumored Apple Car was canceled back in February. That's despite an investment of more than $10 billion (yes, with a ""b"") over a decade, according to a recent report from The New York Times.

"The 2025 Rivian R1S Is Better, but So Is Its Competition",https://www.motor1.com/reviews/733727/2025-rivian-r1s-first-drive/,"The R1S is still a great SUV, but tougher competition has exposed more of its weak points.",2024-12-25 08:50:43,"Rivian’s R1S is essentially all-new for 2025, but you’d be forgiven for not knowing that by looking at it. It’s got new batteries, new motors, new software, and even new wiring, but the sheet metal is virtually untouched—it’s still the same friendly two-box design from 2022.
What has changed is the R1S’s competition. When it was new, the R1S was basically the only way to get an electrified (standard) three-row SUV; Now, it competes directly against an ever-growing segment of vehicles from EV upstarts and legacy manufacturers, and it makes the R1S a tougher sell. For 2025, the R1S now costs $75,900, which means a base model is priced roughly the same as a top-of-the-line Kia EV9 GT-Line, one of its biggest competitors.
Buyers of the base model get the same power as before: boatloads. The standard dual-motor drivetrain pumps out a whopping 533 horsepower and 615 pound-feet of torque, vastly more than the 379-horsepower EV9. It only gets faster from there. Upgrade to the Performance package ($5,000, equipped on my test vehicle) and the same pair of motors produce 665 hp and 829 lb-ft.
Rivian also offers a tri-motor with 850 hp and a quad-motor version with 1,025 hp, but the quad-motor R1Ss won’t hit the streets until next year. Those are promised to pull ten-second quarter miles and hit 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. For my purposes, 665 horsepower was plenty.
For supplying juice to those in-house-designed motors, Rivian offers three battery sizes: A 92.0-kilowatt-hour Standard, a 109.0-kilowatt-hour Large, and a 141.0-kilowatt-hour Max. The battery chemistries and actual capacities are different from the previous R1S, but that’s primarily to help Rivian turn a profit, not to radically change the driving experience of the car.
As far as things buyers will notice, the range varies from a quite-good 258 miles to an outstanding 410 miles, depending on the battery and vehicle specification chosen. My test vehicle was a Dual Max, which offers the full 410 miles of range; This handily bests the Tesla Model X’s 335 miles and the EV9’s 304 miles. Replenishing times are also excellent, with Large and Max packs offering a 220-kilowatt maximum charging rate on DC fast-chargers, translating to 140 miles of range in just 20 minutes.
Buyers should note that price climbs quickly with larger, faster batteries, though. The R1S Dual Max starts at $89,900, but as-tested, the R1S I drove cost $100,950—more than a much-faster Model X Plaid and rapidly approaching the sticker on a Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV ($105,550).
This is where comparison shopping the R1S starts to show weaknesses. For buyers who value off-road ability, the R1S is unrivaled by any EV short of the Hummer—36 inches of wade depth, 15 inches of ground clearance, 35.8 degrees of approach angle. But on the road, it isn’t quite a premium ride. Despite updated and improved suspension, the R1S rides like an old-school SUV than a modern-day luxury EV. In ""normal,"" it feels a bit too stiff on less-maintained b-roads. In “soft”, it rides like its rebound rate doesn’t quite match its compression rate. And potholes at speed lead to more cabin vibration than its road-focused electric competition.
The 2025 model is updated to a hydraulic anti-roll system, which works excellently, as body lean in cornering is well-managed. The steering is sharp, and the Dual Max stayed well-planted on full-throttle pulls. Still, because of the suspension tuning, if I were choosing a vehicle for a long road trip I’d be more likely to eye an EV9 or an EQS for overall ride comfort.
Inside the cabin, I appreciated the new software written for the 15.6-inch infotainment screen and 12.3-inch driver gauge cluster. Response times are excellent, and graphics for changing drive modes and entering menus are crisply animated. The electric-dimming roof-spanning skylight equipped on my Dual Max was gorgeous and worked well, when dimmed, at keeping most of the heat out of the interior despite 100+ F temps outside. The synthetic leather upholstery feels nice enough, the new in-house premium audio system blasts tunes with clarity, and the woodgrain trim is a thoughtful touch. It’s pleasant when parked.
Actually driving and interacting with the R1S’s cabin, however, is a different story. Rivian has persisted with its virtually button-free philosophy for 2025, and the R1S suffers greatly for it. This anti-tactile ethos applies to things such as mirror and steering column adjustments, climate control, and even the aim of the air vents, which are controlled by dragging icons on the 15.6-inch center screen. Even tech-centric Lucid doesn’t relegate climate control aim to its touchscreen.
While minimalism has its place, the R1S’s single-minded insistence on a screen-centric cabin is frustrating. It’s also at odds with its off-road audience: I shouldn’t need to remove my gloves after a long day skiing to re-aim my heat towards my hands. The NFC card “key” also gave me troubles, even on my short test drive, as the vehicle didn’t recognize I’d left it in the center console sometimes when I’d hop out to take photos.
The R1S also still lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functionality, although 2025 models offer a $149/year Connect+ subscription, which offers Apple Music and Spotify integration (as well as thousands of other streaming apps).
This puts the R1S in a strange spot. In 2025 models, Rivian dropped 40 pounds from the wiring, improved its motor and battery engineering, drastically cut the number of computers required on-board, and added hardware that can support semi-autonomous functionality to rival Autopilot and Super Cruise. (The complete semi-autonomous software  still isn’t available, although Rivian has added an automatic lane-change feature via an OTA update this summer.)
Buyers won’t notice most of these changes, though, and whatever cost savings the company found haven’t been passed on. With the $55,000 EV9 on the market and the launch dates for the Cadillac Vistiq, Lucid Gravity, and Hyundai’s to-be-named three-row EV all looming, the R1S has a much tougher case to make now than it did two years ago.

Lotus Teases Its New Electric Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/733737/lotus-electric-sports-teaser-video/,The so-called Theory 1 debuts later this week.,2024-12-25 08:50:44,"Lotus is going electric, as evidenced by the Emeya SUV and the Eletre sedan. The Emira, meanwhile, is the brand's last gas-powered vehicle and will only survive another few years. But that doesn't mean we won't get sports cars under Lotus's new electrification strategy. The first one (at least a concept of which) debuts on September 17.
Lotus shared two videos on social media previewing the next-gen sports car. Lotus calls it the Theory 1 and tosses out words like ""analog"" and ""natural"" to describe it, meant to harken back to the automaker's glory days.
From what we can see in the teaser, the vehicle has slim taillight bars on either side of a ""LOTUS"" wordmark. There's a Kammback-style rear end and an aggressive spoiler perched on top of it. It certainly doesn't look like an Emeya or Eletre from these angles.
The name Theory 1 suggests this is just a concept, but one that could preview an eventual production supercar or sports car. A new Lotus coupe was due in 2027—which the company codenamed the Type 135—but it may be pushed back due to battery technology issues. That EV would take on the upcoming Porsche Boxster / Cayman EV.
Rumors suggested this electric sports car would have 469 horsepower in base form and up to 872 horsepower with the dual-motor model, while starting at under $100,000. It would replace the Elise and Emira in the lineup, and use the Lotus LEVA (Lightweight Electric Vehicle Architecture) platform.
We'll have to wait and see if this electric Lotus actually comes to fruition.

Stellantis Invests $406M In U.S. Plants To Build BEVs Alongside ICE Models,https://www.motor1.com/news/733390/stellantis-investment-factories-bev/,"The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will be its first US factory to build a fully electric vehicle, the Ram 1500 REV.",2024-12-25 08:50:45,"On Wednesday, Stellantis announced it is investing $406 million into three Michigan factories. The money will go toward preparing the facilities to produce battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and their associated components, and the automaker plans to build BEVs alongside their combustion-powered counterparts as it navigates a changing automotive industry and faces questions about its future in the United States.
The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant is getting the bulk of the investment—$235.5 million—which will allow the facility to produce the electric Ram 1500 Rev and the range-extended 1500 Ramcharger. It’ll be the company’s first US plant to build a fully electric vehicle. (The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona will be built in Brampton, Ontario, just outside Toronto.) The company has installed a new conveyor system, new automation processes for BEVs, and retooling to allow it to build gas- and battery-powered pickups on the same line.
Nearly $100 million will go to preparing the Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce the electric Jeep Wagoneer. Stellantis will have the ability to assemble the electric vehicle on the same line as the combustion-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models, which should allow it to tweak production to better build the types of vehicles customers want.
Flexibility is something that Dodge CEO Matt McAlear talked about last month regarding the new Charger Daytona, which rides in the STLA Large platform that Stellantis is investing in. The Dodge will spawn BEV and combustion-powered models.
The smallest investment, $73 million, will go to improve the automaker’s Dundee Engine Plant. The money will help retool the factory to build battery trays for the STLA Frame platform later this year and front and rear beams for the STLA Large architecture in 2026. Stellantis will build those components alongside two new combustion engines, including a new 1.6-liter inline-four that the company could use for future hybrid-electric vehicles.
The future is unclear, especially for automakers. People must make vital decisions years before a product goes on sale. Stellantis has 14 brands under its control after the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles merged in 2021, and the company’s plan to give every one of them a decade to prove their worth remains in place even as sales decline and the lineup thins in the US. But it takes time to chart a new course, and we will see new products from Stellantis soon.

Remember The $250K Lightyear EV? The First One Is For Sale,https://www.motor1.com/news/733262/lightyear-0-ev-for-sale/,And it may sell for considerably less than the production car would've.,2024-12-25 08:50:47,"Step back in time a few years to the roaring teens—2019 to be exact. Electric cars were on the cusp of mainstream popularity and among them was the Lightyear 1, a sleek prototype sedan from the Finland-based upstart Lightyear. Along with standard charging capabilities, it could draw power from the sun thanks to a plethora of solar panels. Then came 2020 and well, you know what the world's been like ever since.
The Lightyear 1 prototype became the Lightyear 0 production car with a $250,000 sticker price, then production suddenly ended in 2023 shortly before Lightyear's operating company, Atlas Technologies, filed for bankruptcy. However, the original car still exists and you can imagine our surprise when it showed up on Troostwijk Auctions in the Netherlands just a few days ago. As of our post on September 10, the bidding stands at 13,500 euros, which equates to approximately $14,900. The auction closes at the end of September so there's still plenty of time for the price to climb higher.
What will the winning bidder get? The car is listed as chassis number 1, apparently fully functional with a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph) and a WLTP range of 388 miles from a 60.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack. If that sounds familiar, it's the same figures Lightyear promoted when production of the Lightyear 0 was announced. That goes for the estimated 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles) of solar-charged driving captured through the panels. In theory, provided you live in a nice, sunny location, one could do an average daily commute without needing a plug-in charger for months.
A quick visit to Lightyear's website (yes it still exists) shows the company is now working on solar charging technologies for automobiles. The Lightyear 0 and the proposed Lightyear 2—a considerably less expensive vehicle envisioned to take on the Tesla Model 3—are long gone. As far as we can tell, the car up for auction here could be the only example of its kind in the world.

VW Recalls ID.4 For Electronic Door Latches That Can Pop Open 'Unexpectedly',https://www.motor1.com/news/733370/vw-recalls-120k-cars-for-doors-could-open/,"Every ID.4 built for the United States and Canada is now recalled, totaling 119,408 vehicles.",2024-12-25 08:50:49,"Volkswagen is recalling all ID.4 EVs produced in the US. A problem with the electric door-opening mechanism could cause the doors to open spontaneously, which is most decidedly a safety risk at pretty much any speed. Fortunately, VW isn't aware of any accidents or injuries resulting from this problem. But there are 135 warranty claims connected to the issue.
The ID.4's door handles look traditional, but they're electrically operated. Pulling the handle activates the electric mechanism that pops the door open, and that's where the problem lies. According to the recall, some models may have issues with water working into the handles and reaching the circuit board inside. As you might expect, this can lead to glitches that include unlatching the doors. If this happens, drivers should hear an audible click similar to a door locking or unlocking.
VW has a fix in the works. Dealers will inspect ID.4 door handles and replace defective parts if necessary. In addition, new software will be uploaded to ""update the door handle parameters."" However, the automaker is still fleshing out the new parts and software code, so VW hasn't provided a timeframe for when the fix will be available. In the meantime, VW advises owners to ""contact an authorized Volkswagen dealer without delay to have the vehicle inspected"" if they experience a problem.
Dealer notification of the recall has already taken place. Specific owner notification will start on November 1, but if you own one of the 98,806 ID.4s US-built here in the country or the 20,602 in Canada, you're included in the recall.
If this all sounds familiar, VW issued an identical recall last year for 35,325 vehicles. Those were built at the company's factory in Zwickau, Germany. The latest recall now includes ID.4s built in the US as well.

Who Is Buying the Volvo C40?,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732893/2024-volvo-c40-recharge-review/,The electric coupe-SUV feels like it was made for the most niche Volvo buyer.,2024-12-25 08:50:50,"The Volvo C40 looks good. It's nice to drive. It's quiet, comfortable, and has just enough technology to keep people entertained. And at $59,995 as-tested for this single-motor, extended-range Ultimate model, it's not that pricey given the current luxury EV market.
But for as nice as it all is, I can't figure out who this car is for. The C40 is a Volvo SUV coupe—already a niche within a niche—sporting average range, an average charging rate, and less cargo space than its XC40 Recharge counterpart. It probably doesn't have hoards of people banging down Volvo's doors, and after a week behind the wheel, I'm not convinced even the nerdiest Volvo buyers will find much reason to take the C40 home.
If there's anything that might convince buyers, it's the way the C40 looks. In typical Volvo fashion, this SUV has clean lines, soft angles, and a few necessary—but not over-the-top—sporty cues. The slicked-back roof blends neatly into a trunk lid with a sporty spoiler on top. The taillights run up either side of the rear glass for a nice, cohesive shape. The front end, meanwhile, keeps most of the same elements that make the compact XC40 such a looker.
The interior follows suit: Sporty simplicity. You might be surprised to see cloth seats in a nearly $60,000 luxury vehicle, but they work here. The front and rear chairs have a great shape and feel, making them easy to sit in for hours on end. The rest of the cabin uses clean, simple lines and high-end materials—and a portrait-oriented 8.0-inch touchscreen graces the center of the dash.
Volvo uses the built-in Google system with maps, a voice assistant, Google Play Store access, and finally, Apple CarPlay. You still can't use your phone-based Android Auto, which is annoying, but the C40 runs Google Maps and other functions pretty seamlessly. My only complaint is that the touch response doesn't isn't up to par with modern smartphones, and the Android Automotive system hasn't changed much since its debut in 2019.
This single-motor, extended-range model has a 78.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack (usable capacity) sending power to a single, rear-mounted electric motor. With 248 horsepower and 310 pound-feet worth of instant torque, it takes this single-motor model a modest 6.9 seconds to reach 60 miles per hour, while the dual-motor version gets there in a brisk 4.5 seconds.
Most buyers will find the single-motor model quick enough. It has no issue pulling out in front of traffic and getting up to speed, or passing on the highway. Around town, the instant electrons make it feel zippy, and the aggressive one-pedal driving function means you can maneuver without even touching the brakes.
The C40 has decent moves in the corners, too. The updated 2024 model gains rear-wheel drive, which makes it more fun to flick around than some of the front-drive-based alternatives. The steering is quick, the suspension is responsive, and the single-motor model (while still a heavy vehicle at 4,453 pounds) feels lighter on its tires than some other EVs.
Ultimately though, the single-motor C40 leans into comfort, rather than sportiness. The cabin is coffin-quiet; No pesky gas-engine sounds infiltrating the interior. The only thing you might hear is some wind noise and tire roar at high speeds. According to my ears, the C40 is one of the quietest EVs out there.
But because of that sloped roof, the C40 isn’t as roomy as the XC40. It loses 2.4 inches of rear headroom and 8.5 cubic feet of cargo space compared to its traditional counterpart. It’s not totally uncomfortable, but with my six-foot frame, my head was nearly scraping the headliner.
The single-motor C40 has the better range of the two trims, driving up to 297 miles on a single charge according to the EPA. The dual-motor model gets just 257 miles of range by comparison. That puts the single-motor C40 smack dab in the middle of the pack; It has better range than the Genesis GV60 (294 miles) and Audi Q4 Sportback (265 miles), but falls short of the Ford Mustang Mach-E (320 miles) and Tesla Model Y (310 miles).
In terms of charging, the C40 sucks up electrons at a rate of 200 kilowatts on a DC fast charger. Volvo says that will get you from 10% to 80% in 28 minutes. The Mach-E will do the same in 32 minutes at 150 kilowatts and the Audi does 5% to 80% in 36 minutes at the same rate. The Kia EV6 and Genesis GV60 are the fastest chargers of the group, going from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes at 240 kilowatts.
So who is the Volvo C40 for, exactly? I still haven’t figured it out. The Model Y goes further, the EV6 and GV60 charge faster, and for way less money, you can get a Mach-E with 320 miles of range. If you want something that looks exceptionally pretty, then Volvo’s got you covered. Otherwise, the C40 is a tough sell.

Not Even the Mighty RS7 Can Keep Up With The Ioniq 5 N In A Drag Race,https://www.motor1.com/news/732569/ioniq-5-n-audi-rs7-drag-race/,"Audi's mighty Quattro all-wheel drive impresses against the EV performance car, but in a straight line, it's the Hyundai that wins.",2024-12-25 08:50:52,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is the performance car of the moment. It's the first purely electric car the Motor1 staff truly loves, thanks mostly to its ability to act like an internal combustion-powered vehicle. But it can still do the straight-line acceleration thing incredibly well.
The Carwow YouTube channel brought together an Ioniq 5 N and an Audi RS7 Performance to see which would be quicker in a series of drag races. The RS7 is among the mightiest cruise missile saloons on sale right now, packing 621 horsepower in Performance trim, getting torque to all four wheels via the company's iconic Quattro all-wheel drive.
The Hyundai is no slouch either, making a maximum of 641 horsepower when the boost function is activated. Thanks to its two electric motors, it also gets torque to all four corners. The most interesting factoid, though: Both cars weigh nearly the same, meaning this is a true head-to-head matchup.
In the first of three half-mile standing start drag races, the Audi gets a great start and holds its lead against the Hyundai until the finish. The second race has a far more even start between the two cars, resulting in an extremely close victory for the Ioniq 5. The last race is much of the same, with the EV taking the win by half a car length.
The Carwow team tries a couple of roll-races between the two cars as well. For the first one, the Ioniq 5 is placed into its fake gear-shift mode, which emulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Audi easily walks away with the win. For the next race, the Hyundai was switched to normal EV power delivery, and this time, it took the win (but just barely).
The only test where the Audi was able to secure a real victory was in the braking test. In a side-by-side test from 100 mph, the Audi comes to a stop several car lengths shorter than the Hyundai. While both cars weigh the same, the RS7's bigger brakes and stickier tires likely played a big role in its victory.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Has One Major Flaw,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732714/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-video-review/,It is one of the most impressive modern performance cars ever built. But it’s backed into an impossible corner.,2024-12-25 08:50:53,"Great cars don't come from a committee. Or practicality. Or from any ordinary common sense, really. Great cars come from single-minded devotion, a bit of neurodivergent hyperfixation, and a team given a long enough leash to define its mandate.
One of those great cars is the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.
Even though it's built on the bones of a commuter electric SUV, the Ioniq 5 N is one of the best-handling, most well-rounded, and most interesting vehicles on sale today. It's a true driver's car that prioritizes fun and feel over lap times.
The I5N exists within a fascinating context. The fear was that EVs would be too heavy and bloated to make good performance cars, but even at 4,861 pounds, the Ioniq weighs the same as the brand new and (controversially) hybridized Mercedes C63S E Performance, and hundreds of pounds less than the latest BMW M5. Compared to the Mercedes, at least, the Hyundai is miles better to drive.
But it still has one big flaw: You can’t take it on an aimless, meandering drive due to its severely compromised real-world range. That's a pretty big flaw. That problem could get fixed soon with a shiny new NACS connector, but I doubt it will ever be that simple.

BMW Built An Excellent 4 Series Sedan. It's Also An EV,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/732414/2024-bmw-i4-ev-review/,"By leaving EV gimmicks behind, the 2024 i4 eDrive35 Gran Coupe does dignified electric conveyance with aplomb.",2024-12-25 08:50:55,"So much of the conversation about EVs isn't about EVs. We owe much of this to Elon and identity politics, of course, but even with the political shellac stripped back, we rarely talk about EVs in the context of ""normal"" automobiles.
The automakers are partly to blame.
In a desperate bid to separate their EV lineup from ""traditional"" vehicles, most automakers divert from established norms. For example, Mercedes won’t simply sell you an EV that looks, feels, and drives like an E-Class. Instead, it builds the awful EQE.
It’s a Mercedes sculpted by painfully generic ""aero"" body lines, wrapped around a dysfunctional interior. The EQE is an astonishingly fast vehicle that’s less joyful to ride than your dentist’s chair.
This is nearly an industry-wide phenomenon. Automakers think that because EVs use a fundamentally different means of propulsion that customers expect a fundamentally different driving experience.
What if, however, a company took its most-beloved model and did something different, preserving or even enhancing its road manners?
Take BMW. What if it built a normal 3 Series sedan that happened to have some batteries in the floor? How would it drive? How would it function?
Excellently, in fact.
BMW calls this mid-size EV sedan the *deep breath* 2024 BMW i4 eDrive35 Gran Coupe. Effectively, it’s a classic 3 Series sedan with a liftback, saddled by some clunky nomenclature.
That’s where the bad news ends. Once you hurdle the awkward naming conventions, you’ll find BMW has adhered to its older, better conventions.
Like every single 3 Series, the i4 GC looks great, drives pleasantly, and folds into daily life like it was borne into your own garage. During a week with the i4 Gran Coupe, I ran errands, suffered traffic, chased one sunset down a mountain backroad, and generally just lived with the car. The i4 didn’t misstep even once.
This is a great sedan, period. And even a great-looking one.
Despite riding on an EV “skateboard,” with batteries lining its belly, the i4 GC sticks with BMW’s classic sedan proportions. That means a long, low hood, with tight angles where they should be and swooping sections covering everything else. I still don’t love the gigantic buck-tooth grille, but painted in a dazzling silver called Dravit Grey Metallic ($1,500), the i4’s side profile and rear-three-quarter angles look spectacular (note the vehicle pictured here is the i4 edrive40 trim, slightly different to our hero car, but equally spectacular). None of this car’s proportions hint at electric propulsion.
Especially the smartly appointed interior, which offers ample headroom, a large and usable trunk (aided by that hatchback glass), and just enough luxury and technology to show its driver where that lease payment is going every month.
Instead of visual gimmicks, BMW’s design department simply penned a nice-looking sedan from every angle, inside and out, and threw it to the engineering department to do the rest.
Beneath that finely tailored exterior, an 81.5-kilowatt lithium-ion battery pack powers a single rear motor producing 282 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, all sent to the rear wheels.
This slug of power and the i4’s low-drag body amount to a combined 110 MPGe over a projected range of 252 miles. Over the course of my week in the i4, I used maybe a “half tank” of electrons. Never did I suffer range anxiety, though super commuters may get squeamish.
These are not industry-leading numbers for range or efficiency, but they were sufficient for my family’s needs. A simple nightly recharge would cover 95 percent of driving scenarios, and I suspect fit neatly into the lives of many suburban families shopping for a BMW sedan.
If you don’t have the ability to charge this BMW in your garage overnight (a convenience that’s probably not considered enough), you’re better served by a gas-powered Bimmer.
BMW claims 5.8 seconds to 60 miles per hour, but from a few hard pulls up to interstate speeds, I’d say that figure’s pessimistic by a huge chunk. My old M3 hit 60 in about 5.5 seconds and this i4 would leave it for dead. From a dig, or on a highway pull, i4 will rip right up to its 118 mph top speed in moments.
Rather than beat you over the head with its EV-ness during those hard accelerations, BMW plays just a scooch of simulated powertrain noise over the i4 GC’s interior speakers. It’s one of the few pure EV gimmicks you’ll find here and the car can be spec’d without it. The sound is so subtle I preferred to keep it on, if only to pair some audio feedback with the snap of EV acceleration.
This BMW’s EV powertrain offers a traditional two-pedal driving routine, along with one-pedal driving as well. The latter option felt crisp and well-calibrated, with a snappy transition to braking when the go-fast pedal is released. The one-pedal system feels especially crisp but never distracting with the i4’s drive mode selector set to “Sport.”
I prefer the pedal sensitivity, steering weight, and suspension response of Sport. While I wish the Sport damping curve felt a bit more lax, you can imagine the amount of spring rate BMW had to throw at a vehicle this heavy to make it feel responsive, and the damping required to rein in this EV’s rebounding body.
Still, Sport offers the most-responsive calibration of each major chassis and powertrain system, livening the i4 GC from relaxed conveyance into a true Sport Sedan.
With a base price of $52,200, this eDrive35 trim offers the best value among the i4 range. It’s plenty quick for daily driving and backroad hustling, quick enough that I wouldn’t be tempted by more-expensive trims.
The M Sport package ($3100) feels like a must-have, owing to the adaptive suspension and gorgeous wheels, but I could leave everything else off the build sheet (though the Harman Kardon sound system would tempt me at $875, as would San Remo green paint ($650) and heated seats ($500)).
That places the i4 eDrive 35 squarely in competitive territory, pitted against ICE sedans, hybrids, and EVs alike. But none of them offer the goldilocks mix of this BMW.
Its gas-powered competitors are slower, less composed, and often have less badge equity. Hybrid cars doubly so. Other EVs will outpace this BMW for around $55,000, but none look as handsome and drive as nicely.
Lease deals on these cars keep getting sweeter. As a second vehicle to sit beside the gas-powered truck or SUV that already lives in your garage, it’s a deeply competitive offering from BMW.
In that way, this new BMW is a lot like the old BMWs we love so much. It blends form with function, backs up its good looks with amenities, and pairs quick reflexes to superb road manners.
The i4 eDrive 35 Gran Coupe is a great BMW sedan. It’s also an EV.

2024 Kia EV9: The Good And The Bad,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/731077/2024-kia-ev9-pros-cons-review/,"Kia’s first electric three-row is a solid performer, but it’s not without flaws.",2024-12-25 08:50:57,"The 2024 Kia EV9 is one of the only mainstream three-row EVs you can get, and it gets the basics right. This SUV is efficient, charges quickly thanks to a high-voltage architecture, and is extremely comfortable even full of people. Just on that basis, it’s a good buy.
There are a lot of little things that could be polished, however. The ride could use work, the charging is fast but not without hiccups (unrelated to charging infrastructure), and the interior—while packed full of amenities—lacks a premium touch in terms of look and feel.
Ultimately, it’s not enough to dissuade a respective buyer from going all-in, but if it were my $78,430 to spend, I might wait for the facelift in a few years.
Let’s get the bad stuff out of the way first, because the foibles were enough to dampen what was otherwise a very pleasant experience.
I drove nearly 1,000 miles in the EV9, and three out of the four times I charged it, the car didn’t want to shift into drive or reverse afterward, which was frustrating. At first, I thought it was because the battery had overheated, although talking with Kia, I realized that was not the case. More likely, it was a user error on my part, which, in my opinion, seems more like a design failure than my own incompetence (although don’t put that past me.)
If I sat in the car while it was charging with the AC on, a red battery icon showed up on the dash after I unplugged the vehicle. It looked exactly the same as if the 12-volt battery in a normal car had a fault. There was no message in the infotainment telling me what to do—I just couldn't shift into drive or reverse. After cycling the car’s power several times (thankfully, the EV9 still has a physical on/off switch, unlike many other EVs), eventually it came back to life. Each time I was stuck in the charging stall for around five minutes, unsure of what to do.
Speaking to a Kia representative, it seemed like using the vehicle’s systems (AC, infotainment, etc.), while the car is charging puts it into ""accessory mode,"" which makes it unable to shift into drive or reverse. An extra tap on the brake pedal would’ve allegedly taken me out of this mode, but that was definitely something I tried. Maybe I didn’t have the process going in the right order, but needless to say, if you’re charging your EV9 it might just be best to turn the car off and get out to avoid any frustration.
The other foibles were pretty minor by comparison. The main functions of the center display are accessible via a series of capacitive buttons on the dash that require a hard press to activate, compressing the hard plastic they’re embedded in. It feels and sounds bad. The menus also have a small but nevertheless annoying amount of lag, and they’re not organized well.
At high speeds, the ride is poor. Despite having fully independent suspension, the EV9 judders over broken pavement on the highway like a pickup truck. Smaller wheels and tires, at least smaller than the 20-inch alloys on this tester, would do it favors. To be clear, though, this ride characteristic is a feature of many electric vehicles, especially crossovers and SUVs. It’s not unique to the EV9.
The good things were momentous in comparison, especially if you frequently carry a lot of people around.
The seats in the EV9 are a step above almost anything I’ve driven, including the six-figure Mercedes-Benz EQS, the Cadillac Escalade, and even the Kia Carnival—a very plush minivan with similar features but not nearly the same level of comfort. Either of the two highest EV9 trims can be specced with eight-way adjustable second-row captain chairs, which are heated and ventilated (a second-row bench is standard). The driver and passenger get the same treatment, with the addition of a massage feature for the driver.
Using the seats' heating/cooling function instead of the regular HVAC will save you a fair amount of range, as the car’s energy consumption menu clearly shows. Range fluctuations of 5 to 10 miles are possible on hot days if you use the car’s heat pump. That said, the EV9 is efficient even if you’re not micromanaging it.
I averaged over three miles per kWh over the hundreds of miles I drove, which puts its realistic range easily above its EPA estimate of 280 miles. Indeed, it’s even better than the smaller two-row Cadillac Lyriq I drove earlier this year, though that car was driven during an especially chilly and rainy New England winter.
In other words, the EV9 can go the distance, at least with the larger battery. According to the EPA, the standard battery on the EV9 will take you just 230 miles. Opting for rear-wheel drive versus all-wheel drive will likewise net you more range, although that’s a luxury some buyers will doubtlessly think twice about giving up.
AWD also unlocks the EV9’s full performance. The base RWD car gets just 215 horsepower, which is not a lot for an SUV that weighs in at just over 5,000 pounds. AWD EV9s are heavier at around 5,700 lbs, but they get a dual motor setup good for 379 hp, which is more than enough for a family SUV.
The competition, especially from America, will pick up in short order, though. On the higher end, Lucid will soon start production of its three-row Gravity SUV. It will be more expensive than the EV9, but it will charge faster and go much further. Likely over 400 miles. The Cadillac Vistiq will also arrive next year as a 2026 model-year vehicle. Its range will be very similar to the Kia’s, and using the Lyriq’s and Optiq’s excellent interior as a reference, it could be even more pleasant inside.
Even with some imminent competition on the horizon, though, the EV9 is a solid option for people who want to go electric but need room for seven or more people. Sure, there are a lot of little things that could use some work, but the overall package is impressive. Despite being the first electric three-row out there, it will doubtlessly be a strong competitor in the growing segment.

It's Official: Nissan Is Working on a New Silvia Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/732599/new-nissan-silvia-development-starts/,"Work has started on a third sports car, but a production version has still yet to be approved.",2024-12-25 08:50:57,"It’s been over a decade since Nissan introduced the retro-flavored IDx concept, hinting at a third sports car alongside the 370Z and GT-R. The former 370Z was replaced by the new Z, and the GT-R is dead—at least for the time being. The IDx, meanwhile, would've been too costly to produce and there wasn't enough demand. Nissan was also concerned it would've cannibalized sales of the 370Z.
However, Nissan has been dropping hints lately about launching a third performance model. The company has gone on record several times about resurrecting the beloved Silvia nameplate. But now it's official: The Silvia is coming back.
In a new interview with Australia's Drive magazine, a high-ranked official confirmed the sports car is officially in the works. Nissan Vice-President Global Product Strategy Ivan Espinosa shared the good news: ""We've been doing some very early upstream exercises of what the architecture could look like.""
An ""upstream exercise"" is a business process that basically refers to initial planning and the early stages of development. Espinosa aims for Nissan to have the sports car ready before the end of the decade with an electrified powertrain. That may be bad news for purists but a gas-only setup wouldn't work globally, especially in Europe where there are stringent emissions regulations that keep getting stricter.
Nissan wants the reborn Silvia to comply with regulations in as many countries as possible so it can ramp up production to achieve economies of scale. Even though sports cars are a niche market and developing one from scratch is a costly endeavor, Nissan won't join forces with another automaker to make it happen. Rather than going down the Z4/Supra, GR86/BRZ, or Miata/124 Spider route, the new Silvia will be an all-Nissan effort.
Espinosa is confident the company can ride solo in the engineering process but admits the project necessitates ""a serious level of investment,"" which is a ""difficult"" commitment to make. A new Silvia would be developed from the ground up, and his wish is for Nissan to skip a collaboration with another brand.
""I'm trying, as I said and I keep saying it in my brain, three sports cars in my lineup, a GT-R, a Z, and something else. And this something else in my brain is called the Silvia. Now, will we do it? I'm trying. I'm not sure we're going do it, just to be 100% clear, but It's something that I would like to do if we, if we can. I'm trying to make it work, I'm trying to make it happen. It's not an easy case. it's not easy because the sports cars market is shrinking.""
The fact of the matter is sports cars don't sell all that well. Nissan took its sweet time replacing the 370Z with a Z, and that's not even an all-new vehicle. It's understandable why the company is reluctant to pour a lot of money in what would ultimately be a niche product when it already has one (Z) and is working on another (GT-R). The mighty Godzilla going on a multi-year hiatus goes to show why Nissan is not rushing to replace the R35 anytime soon.
Launching a third sports car adds another level of complexity during challenging times for Nissan given the need to electrify its lineup. We can only hope that it makes the cut considering the Silvia's cult following and the scarcity of affordable sports cars. Honda's reborn Prelude gives us hope this segment of the market can survive in an SUV-hungry world.

Legendary Rally Car Maker Prodrive Builds An Electric Cargo Van Now,https://www.motor1.com/news/732582/evolv-electric-cargo-van-prodrive/,"It’s called the Elm Mobility Evolv, and it can go up to 100 miles on a charge.",2024-12-25 08:50:58,"Prodrive makes cool stuff. The Oxfordshire, England-based engineering firm gave us the stunning P25 Subaru 22B restomod, several Le Mans-spec race cars, a handful of Dakar trophy trucks, and of course, Colin McRae's legendary Subaru rally cars. Now Prodrive is teaming up with Astheimer Design for an adorable utility van.
The joint project is called Elm Mobility, and the first product out of that partnership is the pint-sized Evolv electric van. Designed for use as a ""last-mile"" delivery vehicle, the Evolv van is a mere 128.0 inches long, 57.0 inches wide, and weighs just 1,874 pounds.
The van's main cargo area can hold freight up to 5.2 feet tall and weighing more than 660 pounds. A secondary cargo area (accessible via rear ""barn doors"") offers another 3.9 feet and 440 pounds worth of capability. It even has a turning radius of 25.6 feet—just shy of a London taxi cab's 25.0-foot turning radius.
The driver sits in a single-seat cabin with a huge wraparound windshield for maximum visibility (it even has two windshield wipers). But don't worry, Elm says the Evolv meets N1 (small van) safety crash standards in Europe. It also promises to be one of the most capable and efficient vehicles in the L7e category.
The proposed battery is a 20.0-kilowatt-hour pack with about 100 miles of range—just enough for short-distance deliveries. Plugging into a level 2 charger would refill the van from 20-80 percent in less than two hours. The listed top speed is just 50 miles per hour, but Elm says that other battery configurations are ""under consideration.""
The Elm Evolv van is just a concept for now, but production is planned for 2028. The company is currently working with an investor in the US to bring a small fleet of electric vans Stateside, but the majority of them will remain in Europe. Elm wants to build 10,000 units annually by 2030, with pricing estimated to be somewhere in the $30,000 mark (£25,000).

BMW Will Launch A Hydrogen Car In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/732646/2028-bmw-hydrogen-car-confirmed/,It's teaming up with Toyota to make it happen.,2024-12-25 08:50:59,"A new player is about to enter the hydrogen game as BMW has confirmed plans to roll out a fuel cell electric vehicle in 2028. To bring the project to fruition, it's expanding its existing collaboration with Toyota, one of the few other automakers that still believes hydrogen has a future. While the Japanese brand has been selling the Mirai for a decade, this will be BMW's first hydrogen car people will actually be able to buy.
Since the vehicle won't be launching for another four years, BMW refrains from going into details. However, it does say the hydrogen model will be a version of an existing product. Munich’s latest hydrogen project is based on the X5. That being said, logic tells us a hydrogen SUV would not be a production version of the iX5 pictured here. This generation of the luxobarge is already in the second half of its life cycle. By 2028, it will have been replaced by the next-gen vehicle.
Whichever shape it'll take, BMW pledges to sell an original product that'll stay true to the brand instead of being a reskinned Toyota. Naturally, the latter is working on its own cars that will utilize the hydrogen fuel cell tech it's developing with its Bavarian partner. In the meantime, it's worth noting the fuel cells that go into the iX5 Hydrogen are supplied by Toyota.
The zero-emission SUV is part of a test fleet of fewer than 100 units built in Spartanburg and modified at a pilot plant in Munich. It's where the 396-horsepower iX5 gets its pair of 700-bar hydrogen tanks made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The two hold six kilograms of hydrogen for a WLTP range of 313 miles. It takes three to four minutes to refuel the vehicle, so about the same as a gas or diesel X5.
Provided BMW's first hydrogen car will be based on the next-generation X5, it'll be underpinned by the same CLAR platform as the gas/diesel/plug-in hybrid versions. There are reports that BMW might also launch a conventional EV with batteries on the same architecture as the rest of the X5 flavors. The next X5 is supposedly going into production in the latter half of 2026 and should include BEV versions from day one.
Arriving next year, Neue Klasse will be BMW’s first dedicated electric architecture and is being developed with a hydrogen fuel cell setup in mind. However, reports indicate that CLAR will be used instead, at least for the initial hydrogen efforts.
This might come as a surprise, but BMW has been actively involved in the development of hydrogen cars since 1979. It all started with the 520h featuring a combustion engine modified to run on hydrogen, a formula that was repeated later with the V-12-powered E38 and E65 sedans during the 2000s. That said, work on hydrogen ICEs was abandoned many years ago as the engineers preferred to focus on fuel cells after realizing they're more efficient.
Speaking with GoAuto earlier this year, Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group, said:
""Basically, with the X5 Hydrogen FCEV we get around 500 km [310 miles] from a fill. If I put a combustion engine in the same car with the same tank, I wouldn't even get 300 km [186 miles]. That is the difference between a product we can sell, and a product we cannot sell. At the 500-km [310-mile] mark, and with a refueling time of three to four minutes, I think people will consider making the move to hydrogen – so, it is relevant.""
There is a major problem we'd like to highlight. Yes, the refueling infrastructure. It’s basically nonexistent in many parts of the world, so we won’t be surprised if the vehicle will only be sold in select regions where owners can juice up their hydrogen cars. 2028 is four years away and the network might improve by then. BMW and Toyota do say they’re ""seeking regional or local projects to further drive the development of hydrogen infrastructure through collaborative initiatives.""

In other words, the initial goal to become a pure EV brand by 2030 might not be achieved. Fast forward to early September, Volvo is now officially readjusting its lofty electric goals.
The new target is for plug-in hybrids and electric cars to account for 90-100% of annual sales by the end of the decade. Volvo concedes cars without charging ports are likely to stick around longer than initially estimated, but only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models.""
The Swedish marque believes several factors have contributed to the slower-than-projected adoption of EVs. The development of the charging infrastructure is progressing at a slower pace. In addition, some countries have either reduced or completely eliminated incentives for EVs. Volvo also blames newly applied tariffs on electric cars in certain markets.
Volvo hopes cars with a charging cord (PHEVs+EVs) will account for 50-60% of deliveries by 2025, up from 48% during the second quarter of this year. From April through June, fully electric cars accounted for 26% of total shipments. The company's plan is to continue investments in mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid models as part of its ""strategic adjustments"" to better reflect what people want.
In the long run, Volvo still wants to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Volvo is the latest in a long string of automakers to backtrack from its original electric goals. In recent months, we've seen the likes of Porsche, Mercedes, Bentley, and Ford of Europe push back their aggressive electric agendas.

"Lotus Isn't Doing Well, Guys",https://www.motor1.com/news/731781/lotus-financial-results-first-half-2024/,"Despite a big increase in deliveries, Lotus Tech suffered a net loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in the second quarter of 2024.",2024-12-25 08:51:11,"Lotus's foray into electric cars has had a rocky start. While financial results for the first half of 2024 show a big increase in deliveries over last year, the company has cut its deliveries forecast by over 50 percent. Meanwhile, its losses are only going up.
Lotus Technology, the publicly traded company spun out of Lotus Group responsible for building and selling cars, was previously expecting to deliver around 26,000 cars this year.
""After assessment of the evolving market conditions, and uncertainties posed by new tariff policies in US and EU, the company has revised its delivery target for 2024 to 12,000 units,"" Lotus Tech said in a statement published Wednesday.
The company has sold 4,873 cars globally so far this year, an increase of 239% versus 2023. The spike can be attributed to the start of deliveries for Lotus's two new electric cars, the Electre SUV and the Emeya sedan. The brand has sold 2,389 sedans and SUVs so far in 2024, over just 871 units in 2023.

Deliveries of the gas-powered Lotus Emira sports car have also exploded in the first half of this year. Lotus has sold 2,484 units in 2024 so far, up from just 568 cars in the year prior. This is likely due to the company's ability to start deliveries in the US after years of emissions-related hold-ups.
Despite a huge jump in revenue to accompany the sales—$225 million for the quarter versus just $111 million last year—Lotus's net loss has only widened. It posted a $202 million loss for the quarter, up from $193 million last year. The company says the increase comes from selling and marketing expenses related to its expansion, according to Automotive News.
Not all hope is lost, thankfully. Lotus launched a plan called ""Win26,"" described as a strategy to ""further optimize its internal processes and structures, implementing overall cost measures, and recalibrating its product plans to cater to globally diversified markets,"" with a goal to achieve positive operating cash flow and EBITDA in 2026.
With demand for EVs waning, only time will tell if the brand can turn things around.

Honda's EV Plans Have 'Not Changed',https://www.motor1.com/news/731394/honda-ev-plans-not-changed-interview/,Honda Global Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama says EVs aren't going anywhere.,2024-12-25 08:51:12,"Honda was relatively late to the game on electrification. Only now are we seeing the Prologue and Acura ZDX on the road—both of which use GM's Ultium platform. But even as EV enthusiasm wanes, a new bespoke platform for Acura's next electric SUV and an entire range of 0 Series products means Honda has no plans of slowing its EV roll.
""Many people are talking about the slowdown of EV sales,"" Honda Global Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama told journalists during a roundtable event in Monterey. ""Our focus is clear based on our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.""
2024 Honda Saloon EV Concept
""We have not changed our belief that battery EVs are the most effective solution in the area of small mobility, such as motorcycles or automobiles,"" he continued. ""We are still in the early days of the EV era… We remain confident that the EV shift will continue to proceed steadily… So we will keep our long-term view and we expect that this ecosystem will change step by step.""
For Honda, EVs are still part of the plan. This comes at a time when other automakers have started to roll back EV investments. Ford and General Motors are diverting more funds to plug-in hybrids, while companies like Audi and Mercedes-Benz are pushing their timelines back by years.
But that’s not to say Honda is going all-in on EVs—at least not yet. Kazuhiro Takizawa, the CEO of American Honda, noted that the company will take a ""balanced"" approach to electrification and that ICE and hybrid vehicles will still be part of Honda’s upcoming plans.
2024 Honda Saloon EV Concept
""We will continue to invest in the strength of our hybrid and ICE vehicles,"" Takizawa said, ""giving us a balanced and flexible approach to electrification.… We are taking a unique, flexible approach at our EV hub in Ohio where we will begin the first phase of EV production late next year. This will enable us to better produce all of our gas and electric vehicles on the same production line.""
Honda’s new 0 Series platform introduced at CES earlier this year will underpin future Honda SUVs and even a sports car. Acura will adopt the platform for its performance EV SUV—based on the concept debuted in Monterey—and an ""NSX-Type"" sports car, which Aoyama confirmed in the same interview. This new EV platform, Honda says, will be ""light.""
""We are trying to build a strong EV brand, not an EV business to achieve our goal of zero environmental impact,"" Aoyama notes. ""That is our biggest mission facing us today.""

"Dodge CEO: The Charger Daytona EV Is A 'Better, Faster' Muscle Car",https://www.motor1.com/news/731380/dodge-ceo-charger-daytona-ev/,The brand's new boss wants to continue pushing SRT as its halo product.,2024-12-25 08:51:14,"Stroll through your local Dodge dealer, and you'll likely notice a few remaining Chargers and Challengers left on the lot. Production might have ended for the duo last December, but the glut of remaining stock isn't an accident. The automaker worked with its dealers to ensure they still had product available as it prepared to launch the next-generation Charger.
The brand plans to have fewer than 2,000 Charger and Challengers on lots when the 2024 Charger Daytona EV begins to arrive later this year, according to Dodge brand's new CEO, Matt McAlear, who spoke with Motor1 earlier this month, but it'll continue to have a limited lineup for the foreseeable future.
Dodge will begin building the coupe versions of the new electric Charger Daytona R/T and Scat Pack models sometime this summer, a decision he said was made long before he took over as boss on June 1. A few years ago, automakers went all-in on their electric vehicle plans, laying out ambitious timelines to convert their lineups to battery power, including Stellantis.
""We're putting our best foot forward,"" McAlear told us. ""As excited as I am that this is an EV, we're not going to market this as the new EV."" He said Dodge didn't set out to make a car with the best drag coefficient or the best range. ""We went out to design the best muscle car.""
The Charger Daytona Scat Pack with the standard Stage 2 package will launch with 670 peak horsepower, 627 pound-feet of torque, all-wheel drive, and a $75,185 starting price. The quickest version will reach 60 miles per hour in 3.3 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds. Dodge has already teased that there will be an even more powerful Banshee variant, but are hardcore SRT fans really ready to convert from gas to electrons?
""Some are. Some aren't,"" McAlear admitted, adding that customers don't become EV converts overnight.
However, he said he's encouraged by the fact that Dodge has ""the youngest demographic in the mainstream industry, and they have the highest propensity to adopt electric,"" which may be true, but the brand has spent two decades cultivating a following that's only been fed increasingly high-powered V-8 Hemi engines. This steady V-8 diet has set certain expectations for Dodge's customers, one that kilowatts and electric motors might not be able to satisfy.
The STLA Large platform underpinning the new Charger is profitable with the electric powertrains and flexible enough to meet consumer demand. While Dodge is launching the electric two-door first, followed by four-door Daytona production early next year, it will also have a combustion-powered version called the Charger Sixpack.
It will sit below the all-electric cars while riding on the same platform. It'll have some styling differences and feature the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter Hurricane straight-six already offered in Jeep and Ram, making 420 or 550 hp in SO and HO variants. The Sixpack will be the cheaper entry point into the new Charger lineup, but combustion-loving Dodge buyers will have to wait to buy one.
Production will begin in the second half of 2025, leaving the Charger Daytona to fend for itself as a premium offering in Dodge's thinning lineup until next year. The Charger Daytona R/T is cheaper, at $61,950 to start, nearly $30,000 more than the outgoing, V-6-powered Chargers and Challengers.
The 2024 Hornet starts at $32,995, and the Durango is $42,265, which gives McAlear plenty of room for the ""mainstream performance"" products he feels a future Dodge lineup has to support. He also wants to continue to push SRT as the brand's halo. Bringing products to market without an SRT or ultra-performance element ""does not constitute where we want to continue to grow as America's performance brand,"" he said.
""It needs to be the right nameplates that are done in the Dodge manner that stand out in the sea of sameness,"" McAlear said, unable to provide any hints about upcoming products. This is a big task when horsepower is cheap with battery-electric powertrains.
Dodge hopes features like its Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust can help differentiate the electric Charger from other BEVs, but we'll have to wait to see how consumers react once it's on sale. There has been vocal online criticism of Dodge's shift to electric powertrains, and overall consumer sentiment toward EVs is beginning to wane, especially in America.
The Charger Daytona EV is a ""new, better, faster"" muscle car, according to McAlear, but Dodge will have to work to convince its fans to follow it into a new era. It could alienate the fanbase it worked so hard to grow, and the debates about Dodge's direction will continue until the new Charger hits the road and customers can experience it for themselves.
""If there wasn't debate, if there wasn't consternation, I think I'd be more worried,"" McAlear said.

The Electric Porsche Panamera Won't Kill The Gas Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/731426/porsche-electric-panamera-confirmed/,The two will peacefully coexist for many years.,2024-12-25 08:51:15,"Porsche is playing its cards right with the Cayenne by keeping the gas versions on sale even after the next-generation electric model arrives later this decade. The ICE car will be offered well into the 2030s. Porsche will follow a similar strategy for the Panamera.
Launched earlier this year, the third-generation Panamera has a long shelf life ahead of it. Speaking with Autocar, Porsche's research and development boss confirmed plans for an all-electric Panamera. Michael Steiner told the British magazine the model's duality will echo that of the SUV: ""The new Cayenne is fully electric, but for its whole lifespan we will have the ICE version in parallel. It's the same for the Panamera.""
Considering the electric Panamera launch date hasn't even been announced, and the ICE model will be available during the EV's life cycle, the gas car will likely remain on sale into the next decade. But where will the Panamera without a combustion engine fit in Porsche's lineup? Based on a previous statement made by CEO Oliver Blume, the car could slot above the Taycan: ""I think it could work [having both EVs] because they are playing in different segments. The Panamera is one step higher than the Taycan.""
Porsche has already applied this ICE+EV strategy with the gas and electric Macan models. Well, kind of. The conventionally powered crossover dies in 2026. Meanwhile, it has already been discontinued in Europe because it no longer complies with a stricter cybersecurity law that came into effect earlier this year.
For the same reason, the 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman are no longer for sale in the EU. The sports car duo remains available in other markets but it too will be retired at some point in 2025 to make way for electric replacements.
Porsche still hopes it will reach its target of having EVs account for 80% of sales by 2030 and is renewing the products to pave the way. The large three-row SUV coming later this decade will be exclusively electric. However, the Zuffenhausen-based company is a bit more cautious in terms of EV adoption now that it has realized ""this transition will happen slower in a lot of markets,"" according to Steiner.
He also believes synthetic fuel could help during this gradual switch from ICE to EV by blending e-fuels with gas: ""By the end of the decade, there could be a significant share of e-fuel in use. We could, little by little, gallon by gallon, substitute fossil fuel with e-fuel by mixing a blend.""
Since December 2022, Porsche has been producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile. As a refresher, the combustion engine is expected to get a new lease on life in the EU as sales of new ICE cars could continue after 2035 as long as they're powered by carbon-neutral fuel. However, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse is worried the legislation surrounding the use of synthetic fuels could turn out to be a ""bogus solution:""
""There are currently many indications that the EU Commission is striving for a bogus solution in which the ban on combustion engines is relaxed simply by ostensibly opening up to e-fuels. However, if it then does nothing to accelerate the ramp-up of low-CO2 fuels and make their use practicable, this would be a deliberate ban on combustion engines through the back door.""
Whatever the case may be, Porsche is not abandoning the development of combustion engines. Steiner said investments will continue to be made in the V-6 and V-8 to comply with tougher emissions regulations.

"The ID.Buzz Could've Redeemed VW. Instead, It's Too Little, Too Late",https://www.motor1.com/features/730925/id-buzz-will-fail-opinion/,"With a $60,000-plus base price, the ID.Buzz looks like a swing and a miss on arrival. That’s not what VW needs right now.",2024-12-25 08:51:15,"Volkswagen needs a hit. The ID.Buzz probably won’t be it.
On Tuesday, VW announced US pricing for the long-awaited electric reinterpretation of its iconic Microbus. We knew the ID.Buzz would be expensive, but sheesh, this thing really isn't cheap. It costs $61,545, while the 1st Edition with all-wheel drive is another $10,000 dearer. And on top of that, the Buzz’s range disappoints—234 miles for the rear-drive version, 231 miles for the all-wheel drive.
Dieselgate forced Volkswagen’s hand, pushing the company hard towards EVs. It also turned public opinion against the automaker, a hurdle VW has yet to overcome. The ID.Buzz, a shameless nostalgia play at VW’s golden era, could’ve papered over some of VW’s sins and generated—sorry—buzz for the brand’s coming line of ID models. Instead, this Bus feels too little, too late, and too expensive.
Imagine if the ID.Buzz came out as VW’s first ID car in 2019 or 2020, with a price starting around $40,000. Perhaps wishful thinking, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say that at a lower price, and with a much earlier release, the ID.Buzz could’ve been a moment, the return of a beloved icon at a relatively attainable price. It could’ve had a real cultural impact at a time when EV adoption felt more cautious and critical, and it could’ve changed the conversation around VW.
Instead, VW launched the ID brand with the (not-sold-in-America) ID.3 and ID.4, both of which were disappointments. The ""3"" in ID.3 signified VW’s third game changer, after the Beetle and the Golf. Now, it seems VW will drop the ID.3 entirely in favor of… an electric Golf… which it once sold as the E-Golf, then canceled, only to revive. Apparently.
VW’s huge Dieselgate penalties, combined with heavy and sudden investment in an EV range, meant the automaker had to cost-cut the hell out of its cars. That manifested in the ID models and its gas cars. We went from the Mk7 Golf, a high water mark for the model and one of the nicest cars in the world at any price, to the Mk8, defined by its cheap-feeling interior, user-hostile haptic controls, and a truly baffling infotainment system. The recent Golf facelift aims to right at least some of these wrongs, but the damage was done.
So now we live in a world where people are apathetic about Volkswagen at best, hostile at worst. In comes the ID.Buzz.
We know it has a lot of the same haptic controls people already hate in the Golf, though the Buzz at least has the VW’s newer and seemingly better infotainment system. Still, it is a $60,000-plus Volkswagen minivan. The Boomers nostalgic for VW’s 1960s glory can probably afford it, but one imagines the market for the Buzz is pretty niche.
Plus, it arrives years late, as consumer interest in EVs cools (if not becomes outright hostile, depending on your political slant). Rightly or wrongly, Americans also want range, and sub-250 miles for this sort of money makes ID.Buzz an even harder sell.
Motor1 editorial director Travis Okulski posits that the ID.Buzz could be like the Lotus Elise. When the car finally came to America in 2005, those who wanted an Elise immediately bought them. Then sales cratered. That first year was by far the best for Elise sales, with 3,321 in the U.S. By 2011, its final year, Lotus sold 178 Elise… which was actually up from 2010, when it sold just 95.
And as our colleagues at InsideEVs noted yesterday, automakers need expensive EVs to be successful. It doesn’t cost automakers much more to build a larger, nicer car than to build a cheaper, smaller one. So the auto industry would rather sell fewer of the former than more of the latter. But automakers actually have to sell those larger cars in the first place. It’s hard to see VW moving a lot of ID.Buzzes at this price and time.
You can’t help but imagine what could’ve been. Change a couple details in its story and the ID.Buzz could’ve been the thing that got people excited about VW and its ID line when that’s what the brand needed most. Imagine if VW had caught the #vanlife craze in full swing?
Of course, Dieselgate always signaled a decline in VW quality from the exceptional heights of the Mk7 Golf. But positive sentiment generated by the Buzz could’ve softened the blow.
Instead, we get an expensive niche product that comes long after VW’s hard-earned goodwill has evaporated. Put another way, the ID.Buzz is what Volkswagen will try to sell you, but far from what the company needs.

It Doesn't Take Much To See That The Future Of EVs Is Already Here,https://www.motor1.com/features/730273/the-future-of-evs-is-already-here/,The mood of the day is betting against the astonishing march of technology. That is so unbelievably stupid.,2024-12-25 08:51:17,"Betting against technological progress seems to be in vogue now. That’s been a terrible bet since The Industrial Revolution.
But when it comes to electric vehicles, the pessimism seems unending. Batteries will never get more energy-dense, the proliferation of electric motors will cause a permanent shortage of copper and rare earth minerals, and the planet will run out of lithium before your EV’s third lease payment.
How many papers and opinion columns have you read like that?
If you tune into the technology that’s available even right now, though, you’ll realize those columns are total bullshit. Batteries are about to take a big step, power electronics are striding ahead already, and electric motors are positively rocketing into the future.
In the case of the latter two, we’re talking about components and drive units already in cars, not some YouTube thumbnail pipe-dream. In the case of battery cells, too, the technology already exists. It’s simply on its way to being industrialized.
Let’s get batteries out of the way first, because that seems to be on the front of everybody’s mind. Solid-state batteries are real. Suppliers to major automakers like Ford, BMW, and Volkswagen have already sent them cells for verification. These suppliers didn’t find them on Alibaba, they aren’t some slurry-state middle-ground that’s being hyped to the moon in China. They’re real solid-state cells that are going to end up in cars. BMW is claiming it will have an SSB-powered concept vehicle “before 2025.” After that, it’s just a matter of testing and scaling the technology. BMW is already working on it.
These solid-state cells offer far lower internal resistance than their liquid-electrolyte counterparts, which means lower heating under load. Reduced cooling requirements will simplify pack construction considerably, lowering costs. For reference, the Hummer EV’s roughly 3,000-lb battery pack is an absolute monster, but only around 1,730 pounds of it is actually the battery cells. The rest is cooling passages, electronics, and structural components.
At right around 212 kilowatt-hours, it contains a ton of energy, but if it was full of SSBs, it would be an entirely different beast. Multiple solid-state manufacturers report energy densities in the range of 390 watt-hours per kilogram. Replace the conventional lithium-ion cells in the Hummer, and you would get a 306-kWh pack. An increase in energy of nearly one-third, just by swapping cells.
Power electronics are also making big progress. Many inverters currently use insulated gate bipolar transistors, commonly referred to as IGBTs. They work, but the industry already knows that silicon carbide and gallium nitride are the future for electric vehicles large and small. Major automakers have either already adopted Silicon Carbide or are in the process of doing so.
The switch to Silicon Carbide increases the efficiency of inverters, allowing for greater range. Likewise, while gallium nitride is currently used for lower-power applications like DC-DC converters, (i.e, the devices that take high battery voltage down to 5-12 volts for in-car accessories), they are already being prototyped into full-sized traction inverters, which promises to reduce the size, cost, and complexity of these devices. Power transistors that used to be the size of a quarter are being replaced by more efficient units the size of a grain of rice.
If none of the latter two technological advances are enough, electric motors themselves are simultaneously becoming lighter, smaller, and more powerful. Axial flux motors are already in low-volume production cars from McLaren, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Mercedes-Benz, Lamborghini, and more. These are real motors capable of providing a passenger car with adequate power despite hilariously low mass. A 300-horsepower car in the near future could be powered by an electric motor that weighs less than your average watermelon. These are motors being developed right now by the industry leader, YASA.
Drive units will shrink to sizes that are going to seem legitimately funny. Batteries that already exist are offering nearly 400 wh/kg. This newfound energy isn’t just a drop-in, though. It’s set to be used more efficiently than ever. None of these technologies are impossible, they are inevitable. In small volumes, all of these technologies already exist. We must simply wait for mass-market adoption.
Once you learn just a little bit about this stuff, once you get a passing familiarity with MOSFETs, or battery cells, or electric motors, you begin to understand just how amazing the next few years will be. Our current era of EVs will look stone-aged in hindsight. When we’re all commuting in fully electric or hybrid cars featuring these amazing advancements, we’ll have learned once again, never to bet against progress.

This Million-Dollar Motorhome Can Charge Your EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/730446/million-dollar-motorhome-charge-ev/,"It's got three televisions, two bathrooms, two kitchens, and a built-in Level 2 charger.",2024-12-25 08:51:19,"It's been a minute since we checked out a proper luxury motorhome. This isn't some RV with shiny hardware and wood trim, either. Prevost is known for having some of the most luxurious rigs on the market, and this Loki Coach doesn't disappoint ... so long as you can afford the $2.5-million price tag.
What does a multi-million-dollar motorhome look like? We get a tour from Erik Van Conover on YouTube, who spent time with the RV at this year's Canadian Grand Prix. For starters, the front seats alone are $20,000 each. Push a button on one of ten tablets mounted through the interior and a 65-inch TV drops down from the roof. Another button will raise a 50-inch TV in the master bedroom. And while you're relaxing outside, a 55-inch screen slides out from one of many exterior compartments. If you can't see the racing action live, there's no excuse for missing it on TV.
The living area stretches out with help from two slide-outs, making room for multiple sofas, including one that opens to a bed. The kitchen features a powered table that can stow for more space, and you can't possibly survive without a built-in dishwasher. For that matter, there's a stackable washer/dryer in the kitchen area, too. You'll also find the first of two bathrooms here, tucked neatly across from the pantry. As for all the drawers and cabinets, they're equipped with electromagnetic locks that automatically engage when driving.
There's a king-size bed and a second bathroom at the back, complete with a shower large enough for a bench. A door effectively seals this area from the rest of the RV for privacy. That's also accomplished with privacy glass or full-on shades, all power-operated of course.
Speaking of power, this RV needs a lot of it. The roof is covered in solar panels, and it carries enough lithium batteries to power the multiple air conditioning units for days. When more power is needed, the Loki's diesel engine is set up to charge the batteries. That also means there's enough juice to power a Level 2 EV charger. You'll have to flat-tow or drive the car separately though. Between the exterior kitchen, television, cargo areas, electronics, battery banks, and plumbing for the water system, there isn't room for a garage. Bummer.
It's certainly not a bad way to spend a weekend at a race track. But $2.5 million buys a lot of hotel rooms and cool cars. Just sayin'.

2025 Lamborghini Temerario: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/730034/lamborghini-temerario-horsepower-engine-price-details/,"The Huracan’s replacement has 920 horsepower, three electric motors, and a V-8 with a ridiculous 10,000 rpm redline.",2024-12-25 08:51:20,"The Lamborghini Huracán is gone, which means its lovely naturally aspirated V-10 engine is dead, too. But fans of fast Lamborghinis need not worry, there’s a new super sports car from Sant'Agata Bolognese that promises to be even more thrilling: Meet the Lamborghini Temerario.
Lamborghini calls the Temerario a High-Performance Electrified Vehicle—or, HPEV—and it packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 plug-in hybrid setup with three electric motors. Total output is 920 horsepower, and it takes the Temerario just 2.7 seconds to reach 62 miles per hour. Top speed is 211 miles per hour.
Lamborghini built this new V-8 engine from the ground up. It has a 90-degree ""Hot V"" configuration and a flat-plane crankshaft, with two turbochargers running a maximum pressure of 36 psi. Cast aluminum alloy cylinder heads and titanium connecting rods help keep the weight down, while Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers in the valvetrain ensure the engine can spin up to 10,000 rpm.
Three oil-cooled, axial-flux electric motors join the V-8. Lamborghini stuck the rear motor between the engine and the transversely mounted eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. That electric motor alone produces up to 150 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque. The other two motors, located on the front axle, drive the front wheels and make 82 hp each. Yes, this new Lambo is all-wheel drive—but don't worry, there is a ""Drift Mode"" function that deploys torque at the rear wheels at three varying power levels. The Temerario also has a launch control function.
The battery pack has a capacity of 3.8 kilowatt hours. Plug the Temerario into a traditional AC charging port with up to 7 kilowatts of power, and the battery will recharge in 30 minutes. It can also be recharged through regenerative braking, or directly from the V-8 in as little as 6 minutes. You can drive using the front electric motors exclusively, but Lamborghini doesn't list an EV driving range for the Temerario.
Visually, the Temerario looks like a mix of the larger Revuelto and the outgoing Huracán. The headlights take up a small sliver of each corner of the hood—they’re slimmer even than the Huracán’s—and trendy hexagonal LED running lights sit just beneath them on each side of the front bumper. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fiber options.
In profile, the Temerario isn’t as sleek as the Huracán. It introduces a larger aerodynamic vent just ahead of the rear wheels that improves downforce by 103% compared to the Huracán Evo.
The Temerario Alleggerita lightweight package—with a larger rear wing, unique bumper treatments, and carbon fiber rims—debuts at launch and touts a 158% increase in downforce over the Huracán Evo, and a 55-pound weight reduction over the standard Temerario. Tack on the Carbon Pack, and that drops another 4 pounds through the use of carbon on the rear diffuser, mirror caps, and side air intakes.
Underneath the skin is a new lightweight chassis. Instead of the Huracán’s mixed aluminum and carbon-fiber build, the Temerario’s chassis is entirely aluminum. That yields a 50% drop in material use, 80% fewer heat-welded joints, and a 20% increase in torsional rigidity. It also helps keep the weight down.
Inside, the Tememerario has a cockpit-style cabin littered with hexagonal elements. Headroom improves by 1.3 inches over Huracán, and legroom improves by up to 1.8 inches. Even a 6-foot 6-inch NBA player could wear a helmet in this car, says Lamborghini.
An 8.4-inch vertical touchscreen graces the center of the dash, while the driver has access to a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and the passenger has a slightly smaller 9.1-inch touchscreen display.
One thing we don’t know yet is how much the Lamborghini Temerario costs. The outgoing Huracán Evo started at around $300,000 in the US, so it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility that the Temerario costs around $400,000 or even $500,000. We’ll know more about the Lamborghini Temerario when it goes on sale later this year or early in 2025.

The Rimac Nevera R Is Here. Its Specs Are Unbelievable,https://www.motor1.com/news/730067/rimac-nevera-r-revealed/,The Nevera R ditches the pretense of being a GT and becomes an all-out sports car. 0-60 mph takes 1.74 seconds.,2024-12-25 08:51:21,"Nobody has ever looked at the performance of a Rimac Nevera and thought “huh, maybe they’re holding back a bit.” But according to Rimac, the Nevera is a GT that happens to break records, not an all-out performance car. There was always more on the table, and now its being shown. Welcome to the 2,107 horsepower, 256 mile-per-hour, lowered, lightened, and wing-adorned Rimac Nevera R.
The Nevera R has all the typical stuff you'd expect from a hardcore track star—it’s lighter, more powerful, and more focused. Taking the bones of the Nevera meant that the R already had a spec sheet to end all spec sheets, but Rimac turned the wick up significantly. An extra 193 hp, a next-generation 108 kWh battery pack, and an undisclosed amount of weight reduction turn the Nevera R’s acceleration numbers comical. 0-60 mph takes just 1.74 seconds, 0-124 mph is an even more absurd 4.38 seconds, about as fast as a typical performance car’s 0-60 time. The most unbelievable numbers are the ¼ mile and 0-186 mph time. While it takes just 8.23 seconds to clear 1,320 feet, it takes just a little longer at 8.66 seconds for the Nevera R to reach 186 mph. It’s only the second street car in the 2,000 horsepower club after the Koenigsegg Gemera.
Acceleration is not the full story, however. In preparation to go record-smashing, the Nevera R also sees handling-focused upgrades. The new aero package includes a fixed wing, large diffuser, and a deeper front lip. The tires are now Michelin Cup 2s as standard, combined with more camber to produce more lateral traction. The All-Wheel Torque Vectoring program was retuned to take advantage of the extra mechanical and aero grip, while the steering system was refined for better response. Finally, a new generation of carbon ceramic brakes feature a silicone matrix layer to improve overall performance.
All said, the changes are good for a 3.8-second quicker lap time around the Nardo Handling Track. Dissecting that: The Nardo Handling Track is 3.8 miles long with a 0.6-mile long straightaway, which means the Nevera R is one second faster per mile of track. If that logic stands for the Nürburgring, then the Nevera R is almost certain to break the seven-minute barrier handily, and possibly take the challenge to the overall record holders. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Acura Confirms 'NSX-Type' EV Headed to Production,https://www.motor1.com/news/730443/electric-acura-nsx-confirmed/,"The car will be based on Honda's 0 Series electric platform, and debut in 2027 or 2028.",2024-12-25 08:51:22,"After years of rumors, Acura finally confirmed plans to build an ""NSX-type"" EV.
""We are going to introduce a [new] sports model in 2027 or 2028,"" global executive vice president Shinji Aoyama told a group of journalists, including Motor1, during a roundtable interview at Monterey Car Week.
""We may not call it an NSX, but it's kind of an NSX-type of vehicle,"" Aoyama added.
He went on to say the car would ride on Honda's new 0 (Zero) Series electric architecture, which will underpin its first electric sedan set to launch in 2026.
A third-generation NSX has been rumored since 2021, when Acura vice president and brand officer Jon Ikeda said in an interview that ""there's gonna be another NSX.""
""Our development approach for this new 0 Series [car] is thin and light,"" Aoyama said. ""So this means, basically, how to make the platform thinner than other existing vehicles. So even [with battery dimensions], we are trying to make a thinner vehicle. So that we can realize a lower-height vehicle. This means that we can realize a larger [cabin], as well.""
An all-electric NSX would have big shoes to fill. The last version, which ended production in 2022, used a twin-turbo V-6 and three electric motors to make a combined 600 horsepower (in Type S form). It looked great and handled well, able to take the fight to contemporaries like the McLaren 650S, Lamborghini Huracán, and Ferrari 488.
While straight-line speed won't be a problem for the NSX(ish) EV, handling and track endurance remain a question mark for even the most expensive electric supercars on the market today. Plus there's the issue of sound. The second-gen NSX's V-6 doesn't exactly ignite the soul, but it sounds a whole lot more appealing than the whir of a few electric motors. We'll just have to wait until 2027 to find out what Honda has in store.

"Pininfarina Battista Loses Its Roof, Instantly Gets Cooler",https://www.motor1.com/news/730211/pininfarina-battista-targamerica/,Pininfarina's electric hypercar becomes a targa for this one-off.,2024-12-25 08:51:24,"The Italians do convertibles so well. For further evidence, see this, the Pininfarina Battista Targamerica, an open-top version of the electric hypercar, which makes its debut Thursday for Monterey Car week.
The Targamerica is a coach-built one-off for a special Pininfarina client who already owns a Battista coupe. It's not the first convertible from the modern Automobili Pininfarina—that would be the B95 Speedster—but it is the first open-top Battista. It makes you wonder why the Battista wasn't a convertible to begin with.
Remarkably, it took just a year for the Targamerica to go from conception to reality, with the client comissioning the car at Monterey Car Week last year. Its silver-with-blue-accents livery pays homage to another one-off Pininfarina convertible, the Ferrari Testarossa Spider made for longtime Fiat scion Gianni Angelli in 1986. The rear decklid is unique to the Targamerica, too, as are the doors, which in the coupe are integrated into the roof. Another notable feature is a cigar humidor integrated between the seats. Apparently the client likes their stogies.
Pininfarina Battista Targamerica
As a brief reminder, the Battista is the creation of Automobili Pininfarina, a German-headquartered offshoot of the legendary Italian design house, owned by India's Mahindra. The Battista is based on the Rimac Nevera hypercar, and offers an astonishing 1,900 horsepower from its four electric motors.
Automobili Pininfarina is showing the Targamerica at The Quail on Friday, after which point the client will take delivery. The automaker didn't say whether it'll build more Battista convertibles, we suspect this won't be the last.

During a joint conference on Monday evening on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the UAW said that Musk and Trump used language meant to ""threaten and intimidate"" workers.
""You're the greatest cutter,"" Trump said to Musk during the two-hour conversation. ""I look at what you do. You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike."" Trump continued, ""I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'""
The UAW notes that it is illegal to fire workers under federal labor law while it is also illegal to threaten workers who plan to strike under the National Labor Relations Act. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement that this type of language against workers is ""disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns.""
The UAW and President Shawn Fain have been critical of Trump recently. Fain noted in a video on Monday that, “Donald Trump is all talk, but Kamala Harris has delivered for auto workers.” In that same video, the UAW endorsed Kamala Harris for President of the United States.

"The Charger EV Doesn't Have Fake Shifting, And That Kind Of Sucks",https://www.motor1.com/news/729684/dodge-charger-ev-drifts-donuts-acceleration-video/,"Dodge has revealed a whole lot more info about its Fratzonic ""exhaust"" system. And it's missing one big feature.",2024-12-25 08:51:27,"Dodge has released a whole lot of new information about the synthetic ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" system on its newest car, the Charger Daytona EV. The company has also published a video showing off the car doing donuts and acceleration pulls, complete with audio.
The Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust uses a custom enclosure mounted in the rear lower fascia of the Charger EV, paired with a dedicated amplifier that can produce up to 600 watts of power. Like most performance-minded EV noises, the exhaust uses input from the driver and the car to adjust sound and volume.
Specifically, the Fratzonic exhaust uses inputs like acceleration and deceleration, and makes noises when the car turns on and off. You can even ""rev"" the Charger EV, or just listen to it idle like any gas-powered car. It'll also make a distinct noise if you use the ""PowerShot"" function, which adds 40 horsepower for up to 15 seconds with the push of a button.
A two-minute video released by Dodge shows a Charger Daytona Scat Pack accelerating past a camera before pulling off a smoky donut. After that, we get a few seconds of the car ""idling."" It sounds like a real V-8 to us, but obviously, it's all still fake.
What we don't hear, strangely, are any simulated gears shifting. After Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, we suspected every performance EV going forward would have a feature like that, as it enhances the driving experience exponentially, and gives purpose to all of the synthetic noises. A Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 the Charger does not have any feature of the sort.
So even if you do enjoy the nice V-8 burble from the Charger EV, there's no way to bang through gears or bounce off a ""redline."" It's like pairing a Hemi to a CVT. And that sounds like no fun at all.
Are you a fan of the Fratzonic exhaust? Do you think Dodge made the right call not including fake gears? Let us know in the comments.

Acura's Next EV Will Be A Performance SUV,https://www.motor1.com/news/729536/acura-electric-suv-teaser/,And it may have its own dedicated EV platform.,2024-12-25 08:51:29,"Last year at The Quail in Monterey, Acura showed off its sharp ZDX electric SUV for the first time. And it teased an electric sports car ripe with NSX cues. This year, though, the company has another electric vehicle taking center stage in Monterey—but for now, much of it remains a mystery.
A single teaser image previews the back end of what looks like a pretty sleek vehicle. The taillight design is unique; it forgoes the typical triangular taillights found on most current Acura models for a flowy light bar that extends the width of the trunk lid. An Acura wordmark sits just underneath it, and the vehicle wears a blue paint job.
Acura confirmed this will be the automaker’s first SUV built in Ohio using the company's new dedicated EV platform. So, it sounds like no Ultium underneath. This likely won’t be the subcompact ADX, so our next best guess is something on the ultra-premium side—maybe even an SUV ""coupe,"" something currently missing from the brand’s lineup. Acura uses the word ""performance"" to describe the concept, and says it previews a ""segment-defying sport utility vehicle.""
Details beyond that are pretty slim. But, we’ll know exactly what this concept is when Monterey Car Week kicks off beginning on Monday, August 12. Acura will display this concept on the lawn at The Quail on Friday, August 16. We’ll be there—so stay tuned for more details.

Nissan's New Paint Uses Electromagnetic Waves To Keep Temperatures Down,https://www.motor1.com/news/729520/nissan-paint-electromagnetic-waves-temperatures/,"It's in the testing phase, but early results show a significant drop in both surface and interior temperatures for cars.",2024-12-25 08:51:31,"If you think there's too much tech in cars, just wait until you see this. Nissan is working on a new type of exterior automotive paint that uses electromagnetic waves to keep both the surface and interior cooler. It's still in the testing phase, but preliminary results look very promising.
The automaker is working with Radi-Cool, a company that specializes in cooling products. Radiative paint like this isn't a new concept—it's been used on buildings for years to help keep people and things cooler inside. But as Nissan explains, those applications call for a very thick paint that doesn't have the same durability or shine of an automotive finish. Among other things, it's applied with a roller. And while we've seen people paint cars with rollers, it's not an ideal method for bringing color to your car.
This new formula is designed for use in spray guns and it works with clear topcoats. It's still a thick paint though—six times thicker than a standard automotive finish. Within the mix are two microstructure components that contribute to its cooling ability. The first is designed to reflect near-infrared rays, a common way to keep the heat down. The second component is where the scientific magic happens. It creates electromagnetic waves that don't reflect the sun's rays but actually counteract them. It helps prevent heat transfer to other parts of the car.
""My dream is to create cooler cars without consuming energy"" explained Dr. Susumu Miura, the senior manager of this project. ""This is especially important in the EV era, where the load from running air-conditioning in summer can have a sizable impact on the state of charge,"" he said.
Nissan doesn't explain the intricacies of the paint or how the electromagnetic waves are generated, but the results are pretty conclusive. Comparisons show a temperature drop of 12 degrees Celsius on cars wearing the special finish. That's a measurement of the exterior surface, but the interior was also cooler by 5 degrees Celsius.
So, when can you order a new Z or a Rogue with the ""cool"" paint job? Development is ongoing; among other things, Nissan would like to make the paint even thinner for easier applications. If it does end up in production, it will likely be reserved for special-order vehicles.

"The Dodge Charger EV's Frunk Is Optional, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/729505/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-frunk-optional/,"If you want a little extra storage in your Charger Daytona EV, you'll need to go for a pricey option package.",2024-12-25 08:51:32,"We noticed a curious detail in the press release announcing pricing for the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV. One of the features listed with the $4,995 Plus Group is, simply, ""Frunk."" Wait. Does this mean the front trunk is optional?
Indeed it does, a Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 yesterday.
Bizarrely, Dodge isn't the first to do this. At least in the U.K., the new Audi Q6 E-Tron's frunk is a £500 a-la-carte option. (Audi is yet to release packaging information on the U.S.-spec Q6 E-Tron.) But to the best of our recollection, that's the only other instance of this, EV or otherwise. In the Charger Daytona EV, it's not huge—a video from TFLEV notes it offers 1.5 cubic feet of storage—but it's enough for charging cables and other smaller items.
The Plus Group adds a number of other features to the Charger Daytona including cooled seats, LED lighting, a power rear hatch, wireless phone charging, 20 inch wheels for the base R/T model, and more. Still, this appears to be an odd bit of cost cutting—not including a simple piece of molded plastic under the hood as standard. But, the new Charger Daytona surely won't be as abundantly profitable as the old gas-powered Charger and Challenger, so Dodge has to find ways to eke out margins where it can.
The Charger Daytona is expensive as it is, too. Base price for the R/T is $61,950 and that rises to $75,185 for the Scat Pack, though both do qualify for a $7,500 tax credit when leased. Dodge may yet come out with cheaper models, though. A Dodge spokesperson tells us that ""[f]uture model years will see the Charger Daytona lineup expand to cover a larger portion of the muscle car segment.""

The Latest Rolls-Royce One-Off Is An Extremely Yellow Spectre,https://www.motor1.com/news/729067/rolls-royce-spectre-semaphore/,The Spectre Semaphore gets its own unique paint and a trippy two-tone hood.,2024-12-25 08:51:33,"Rolls-Royce is bringing something special to Monterey this year. This very yellow coupe is called the Spectre Semaphore, a one-off special build that wears a handful of bespoke customizations, including a trippy paint job for the hood and a very bright two-tone interior.
The flashy hue is called Semaphore Yellow, a color crafted specifically for this commission, says Rolls. On the hood is a unique artwork dubbed ""Marble Paint Spill."" Inspired by Californian artists, it's a collection of silver lacquer and multiple layers of clear coat to create what looks like a pool of mixed yellow and silver paint. Rolls-Royce says the hood alone required 160 hours of labor to design and produce.
Sticking with the very yellow color scheme, the interior of the Spectre Semaphore uses a combination of Lemon Yellow and Citrine Yellow to brighten the white seats, doors, and dashboard trim. Wrapping things together is Lemon Yellow stitching, naturally. Rolls was even able to make the center dial in the gauge cluster yellow.
There's no mention of drivetrain changes, meaning the Spectre Semaphore's dual-motor electric drivetrain is likely untouched. It's rated at a combined 577 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque from the factory, with up to 291 miles of range.
Rolls describes the Semaphore as capturing ""the bold new codes of luxury being established by the marque’s confident, youthful client base.""
Into the design? You're in luck. Unlike most bespoke commissions from the brand, this one hasn't been pre-sold. Rolls says it's available to purchase through any authorized dealer in the United States. Though presumably, you'll have to act fast since this is the only one that exists.
The one-off Spectre will make its debut at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering, on August 16 during Monterey Car Week.

Dodge's New EV 'Exhaust' Sounds Way Better Than We Expected,https://www.motor1.com/news/729243/dodge-charger-ev-new-v8-sound/,"It might not be a real V-8, but it's pretty convincing.",2024-12-25 08:51:34,"Dodge's new all-electric Charger is shrouded in controversy. Not only is the Hemi V-8 gone, but it's been replaced with a fake ""Fratzonic"" exhaust sound that doesn't have the internet convinced. The latest version of the sound, revealed this week, should convince at least a few people, though.
The company published a video to Instagram on Monday showing off the latest iteration of the Fratzonic exhaust. We watch and listen as a Charger Daytona EV blasts through a tunnel, outputting what sounds like a good old-fashioned V-8 sound.
The sound is a far cry from the original noise out of the debut in 2022, which was met with a ton of hate. In 2023, Dodge went as far as to change the sound with something resembling an engine, which sounded better but seemingly failed to convince the buying public. And while this latest noise sounds almost exactly like a real V-8, the internet isn't buying it.
""Lol we want real V-8 noises ... not a speaker,"" one comment reads. ""We still want HEMIs,"" says another. ""I’d rather have no car than one of these,"" one commenter says.
Dodge has voiced its struggles with the Fratzonic exhaust since its original reveal. ""We've changed it 100 times,"" CEO Tim Kuniskis confessed to reporters back in March. The system uses a speaker (or speakers) mounted inside an exhaust-like chamber to mimic the sound of a real exhaust.
Judging by the public's reaction to this whole fake exhaust speaker thing, it's clear that people don't actually care whether an electric car sounds like an ICE-powered car or not. Even if the Charger Daytona EV sounds exactly like a Hellcat, people won't be convinced, because they'll know it's not the real thing.
It's like slapping an M badge on a non-M BMW. The only people that care about the badge will also know it's a fake. Likewise, anyone that cares about the exhaust sound coming from a Charger EV will know it's not the real thing.

VW Claims the Electric GTI Will Be More Fun To Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/729001/vw-electric-gti-more-fun-drive/,Volkswagen boss touts superior chassis and suspension compared to the gas GTI.,2024-12-25 08:51:35,"It’s been nearly a year since Volkswagen signaled its intention to do an electric GTI. The ID. GTI Concept will evolve into a production model in 2026 for the European market. VW wants the hot hatch in the United States at a $25,000 price point but it's only wishful thinking at this point. Meanwhile, our colleagues at Motor1 Italy had a chat with the big boss in Wolfsburg about the first GTI without a combustion engine.
Thomas Schäfer didn't miss the occasion to hype up the electric GTI, saying its suspension and chassis ""will be at an even higher level"" compared to the gas model on sale today. The goal is ""to produce a car that isn't just about performance"" but one that's ""even more exciting to experience and drive."" The high-ranked official from VW also mentioned the car will have a ""GTI e-sound,"" so expect artificial engine noise to be pumped through the speakers.
It's worth noting the ID. GTI Concept did not preview an electric Golf GTI but rather a smaller car. The performance-oriented show car from last year's IAA Mobility in Munich was based on the ID. 2all, a Polo-sized electric hatchback. The supermini is still sold in Europe as a GTI with a combustion engine, a 2.0-liter turbo four-pot making 204 horsepower. Before its demise in 2023, the even smaller up! GTI was still offered with a turbo three-cylinder 1.0-liter engine rated at 115 hp.
Another all-electric Golf after the Mk7-based model isn't due until closer to the end of the decade when the Mk9 is scheduled to come out. The current Mk8 Golf with gas engines might live to see 2035 as VW isn't ruling out selling two generations concomitantly for several years. The Golf turns 50 this year and the GTI will reach the same milestone in 2025.
Technically, the Scirocco GTI was the first GTI to hit the assembly line. It entered series production in the summer of 1976 while the Golf GTI followed later that fall. However, VW took the wraps off the first Golf GTI at the 1975 IAA show in Frankfurt.
Speaking at the GTI Fan Fest in Wolfsburg, Schäfer told Motor1 Italy that VW can transfer the ""DNA spirit [of the gasoline GTI] into the electric age."" He went on to say the GTIs that will eschew ICE power will deliver ""high performance and iconic design"" while remaining instantly recognizable. Those three iconic letters stand for Grand Touring Injection but a logo trademark from last year indicated the ""I"" will be replaced by a lightning bolt for the performance EVs.
During the same interview, VW's head honcho reiterated the German automaker still wants electric cars to account for at least 80 percent of annual sales in Europe by 2030. VW Group luxury brands such as Bentley, Porsche, and Audi have recently revised their EV goals, admitting gas cars are likely to stick around for longer than originally estimated.",Adrian Padeanu
The A6 E-Tron Is Audi's First Rear-Wheel Drive Sedan In A Century,https://www.motor1.com/news/728466/audi-a6-e-tron-rwd/,"No, really. To find another rear-drive Audi sedan, you have to go back before the War.",2024-12-25 08:51:37,"A rear-wheel drive sedan isn't abnormal, but one with Audi's four rings on the front? That is very, very unusual. But believe it or not, the base Audi A6 E-Tron—the new electric version of Audi's longstanding mid-size sedan—drives just its rear wheels.
Audi is, of course, a brand defined by its Quattro all-wheel drive system, but it built front-wheel drive cars for much of its history. You have to go all the way back to the Audi 920 of the late 1930s to find an earlier rear-wheel drive Audi sedan than this new A6. And for all of its modern history, the company has only built front or all-wheel drive cars. The only exceptions are the rear-wheel drive versions of the R8 supercar and the base Q4 E-Tron crossover.
Quick history lesson: Audi was formed around the turn of the 20th century, and in 1932, it became part of the Auto Union along with fellow German companies Horch, Wanderer, and DKW. Hence the four rings of the Audi logo. After the War, the Audi name was dropped until the mid-1960s, when Auto Union revived it in favor of DKW.
Most modern Audis can trace their lineage to the DKW F9, which was designed in the early days of World War II as a successor to the Volkswagen Beetle. As an excellent video from the B Sport YouTube channel explains, Auto Union ran with the F9's drivetrain layout of a longitudinal engine ahead of a transmission sending power to the front wheels. In gas-powered cars larger than the A3, it's the layout Audi still uses to this day, albeit often with the addition of a driveshaft going to the rear in the classic Quattro all-wheel drive system. This includes the A6 and all its predecessors.
All of this is to say that there are decades of tradition here, which the A6 E-Tron breaks with. Of course, many single-motor EVs are rear-wheel drive for a variety of reasons, so on some level, it's not that unusual. Plus, the A6's rivals—the Tesla Model S, BMW i5, and Mercedes EQE—are all rear-wheel drive in base form. Still, it's astonishing that this is the first modern, rear-wheel-drive Audi sedan.
Going electric changes everything. This break from tradition doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things, yet it's certainly notable given Audi's history. But, a rear-wheel drive sedan is almost always a good thing, so the base A6 E-Tron might be a sweet spot in the Audi range.

Honda-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Reportedly Planned,https://www.motor1.com/news/728183/honda-nissan-mitsubishi-alliance/,Honda and Nissan are already working together and it looks as though Mitsubishi is about to join them.,2024-12-25 08:51:38,"These are challenging times for automakers. Competition has never been so fierce, fueled by the rise of Chinese car manufacturers who have a head start in the EV race. Add increasingly stricter emissions regulations, and you get the perfect storm. To cope with all the hurdles ahead, some of the biggest names in the industry are joining forces. The recently formed Honda-Nissan alliance could welcome a third player: Mitsubishi.
Nikkei Asia reports that Mitsubishi allegedly wants to join the existing deal between Honda and Nissan. Per the initial agreement announced in mid-March, the collaboration focuses on ""automotive software platforms, core components related to EVs, and complementary products."" Seeing this third Japanese brand join the alliance would make sense, considering Nissan has a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
The report states that Mitsubishi has already signed an NDA with Honda and Nissan to kick off discussions about a wider tie-up. Shortly after the report emerged, shares in Mitsubishi rose by 6.3 percent, according to Reuters. Nissan also saw an increase of 2.8 percent, while Honda gained 2.6 percent.
The three companies working together would reduce R&D costs and speed up development, better fending off Chinese competition. However, final details about the alliance haven't been disclosed. It's worth noting that Nissan and Mitsubishi have been working together with Renault since 1999.
A collaboration between Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi would not be the first Japanese trio formed this year. A few months ago, Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru teamed up to develop a new generation of combustion engines. This next wave of ICEs will focus on hybrid powertrains and compatibility with carbon-neutral fuels. Toyota is preparing several inline-fours, Mazda is enhancing its rotary technology for range-extended EVs, and Subaru is refining its signature boxer engine.
Being the naive person that I am, it would be great for Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi to jointly work on an affordable sports car. Nissan did recently hint about bringing back the Silvia one day. However, this alliance seems to be about less exciting things such as software and EVs. Nikkei Asia reports that plug-in hybrids and kei cars could also be common goals. At the end of the day, it's all about cutting costs, and it's difficult to make profitable sports cars.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Vs. Mercedes-AMG GT: It's Not Even Close,https://www.motor1.com/news/727902/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-races-amg-gt/,The electric crossover is turning out to be a performance bargain.,2024-12-25 08:51:38,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is proving to be a formidable drag racer. The little electric crossover recently shamed several high-end, high-powered SUVs, including a Lamborghini Urus and a Brabus-tuned Mercedes-AMG G63. It's now unleashed its fury on a more appropriate opponent—the Mercedes-AMG GT.
The coupe has AMG’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine under the hood, which delivers 585 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels. The Hyundai has two electric motors that give it all-wheel drive, together producing 650 hp and 545 lb-ft of twist. The AMG has a weight advantage, weighing about 298 pounds less than the electric crossover.
The Hyundai is a quick family hauler. It beat the coupe off the line in the first run and stayed ahead past the finish line. The GT got a much better start in the second race, launching ahead of the 5 N, but the EV reeled in the AMG and beat it by a bumper to the finish line. Both cars completed the quarter-mile race in 11.4 seconds—impressive for a $66,000 electric family crossover that can create fake gearshifts and corresponding exhaust sounds.
The Ioniq also has a few software tricks that were deployed during the rolling races. The EV’s fake gear shifts didn’t help it against the AMG, losing by quite a gap. However, a simple setting change and a press of the boost button in the Ioniq made the second run a completely different race, with the Hyundai leaving the Mercedes behind.
We live in a wild time when reasonably priced Hyundai crossovers outperform six-figure sports cars in a straight line, but that’s the big benefit battery-electric vehicles offer. They democratize horsepower, and it feels like the 5 N is just the beginning of a new age of performance cars that could alter the automotive hierarchy built on combustion power.

"The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance Is Grand Touring, Perfected",https://www.motor1.com/reviews/727478/2025-mercedes-amg-gt63-s-e-performance-review/,Adding hybrid power leans the GT63 farther into its new cross-country personality. And the car is all the better for it.,2024-12-25 08:51:39,"The new Mercedes-AMG GT isn’t the sports car it used to be. These days, the V-8-powered two-door from Affalterbach is more of a grand tourer, with a roomier interior and a wider range of capabilities thanks to standard all-wheel drive, which comes at the cost of added weight. While it’s not as driver-focused as the previous car, the new GT does the cross-country missile thing very well.
The AMG GT63 S E Performance, a new hybrid variant that uses a trick rear-mounted electric motor to add even more power and tech, doubles down on that ethos. With a combined 805 horsepower and 1,047 pound-feet of torque, it’s leagues quicker than the standard car and packed with a whole bunch of fun hybrid tech, adding another layer of complexity to an already complex car.
The E Performance is, in many ways, very similar to the standard GT63. It looks identical, with no changes to the sleek, long-nose body and menacing front end. The carbon-ceramic brakes are the same, the Michelin Pilot S5 tires are the same, and the aero goes largely untouched. The interior is lifted from the pure ICE car, with its gigantic touchscreen control center, digital gauge cluster, and infuriating touch-sensitive controls. If you want an in-depth explanation on why I hate controls like this, read my review of the GT63. In short, they feel like cost-cutting measures that are worse to use versus physical buttons and switchgear.
All of the real changes happen beneath this AMG’s skin. In place of a regular rear differential sits a 201-horsepower electric motor directly on the rear axle using two forward gears. Combined with AMG’s magnificent 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8—making 603 hp in this application—it turns an immensely quick vehicle into the fastest-accelerating gas car I’ve ever driven.
Mercedes claims a 0-60 mph time of 2.7 seconds, making it even quicker than the AMG One hypercar. But the E Performance feels quicker than that number suggests. Where you’d get a slight delay between throttle push and forward thrust in the standard car, here there’s instant gratification. Low-speed response is truly immediate thanks to the e-motor, like you’d find on something purely electric. The biggest surprise doesn’t come at 60 mph, though. It comes at 160.
With free reign of Germany's Autobahn (where there are no speed limits), I'm able to explore the E Performance's explosive acceleration. That electric motor doesn’t just help the car accelerate at low speeds. It helps everywhere. That same gut-punch of electric shove you feel at normal speeds? You also feel it deep into triple digits. Having that kind of immediate forward momentum available at 150-plus-mph is a mind-bending sensation. This is probably what it’s like to drive a Bugatti.
Top speed for the GT63 E Performance is electronically limited to 199 mph. That’s just barely better than the normal GT63’s top speed of 196 mph. Don’t let the numbers fool you, though. While I can see the normal car reaching true V-max at its quoted top speed, this hybrid version feels like it can keep pulling past 215 if the limiter were removed. It took me relatively no time at all to reach an indicated 192 mph on an empty stretch of German highway (the fastest I’ve ever driven a car, anywhere). It was still pulling hard when I had to let off. You’re paying for the way this car reaches these speeds in such a nonchalant, unfazed, and timely manner.
While the powertrain feels seamless from behind the wheel, it’s highly complex. The GT63 hybrid uses a similar setup to the bigger S63 E Performance sedan, with some modifications to the rear diff’s housing to get it to fit into the GT’s underside. The single permanent-magnet synchronous motor is powered by a 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery that lives in the trunk area, taking up a fair bit of what used to be a cavernous hatch. Thankfully the optional rear seats still fold down, so you’ll never be short of space when packing for two.
Because that e-motor is connected directly to the differential, it can actually send torque back up the driveshaft and to the transfer case, which in turn throws twist to the front wheels. That means even in Electric mode—one of eight(!) different drive modes in the E Performance—the car remains all-wheel drive. Of course, the transfer case is almost always sending all the power to the rear to improve vehicle dynamics. Up to 50 percent of the torque can make it to the front axle, but that only occurs in cases where traction is tough to come by, like snowy hills or slippery corner exits.
How that rear-mounted motor delivers its performance depends heavily on your selected drive mode. Keep the GT63 in a calmer mode like Slippery or Comfort, and the system will run the car on battery-only power when it can, only firing the V-8 when there’s demand for extra power—or to recharge using the belt-spun alternator-generator. Throw it into Sport or Race mode, and the engine remains permanently online, constantly topping off the battery via the alternator. This way, you’re never lacking for that instant thrust when you need it.
There’s also a Battery Hold mode which, as the name suggests, runs the E Performance on pure internal combustion power until the driver specifies otherwise. Engineers say the goal here is to deliver a “first- and last-mile” EV solution that allows owners to leave and enter their neighborhood in total silence before firing up that loud twin-turbo motor.
Alongside the drive modes are layers of driver customization tools, from suspension stiffness, to traction control, to aero adjustments, to augmented sound coming through the speakers. Some can be adjusted through the giant touchscreen or the left-hand half-moon screens on the steering wheel. Others, like the aggressiveness of the brake regen, are hidden inside the other screen on the steering wheel beyond the drive mode symbols. There’s even a drift mode that sends all the power to the rear, but it requires jumping through about 46 hoops to activate.
I spent around eight hours in this car over two days, and I was still finding new adjustments toward the end of my drive. You’d need weeks behind the wheel to be truly in-tune with all the tech this car has on offer. For people who like this kind of stuff: You’ll be entertained for months trying out all of the different combinations.
“[The GT63 S E Performance] is for the people who love technology and the engineering craftsmanship we have here at AMG,” head product manager Matthias Schmidt told Motor1. “They want to have the maximum power, that's the most important thing. This [car] is great for long distances but still delivers very good [cornering] performance.”
For those more interested in a pure driving experience, you might want to look elsewhere. All this hybrid stuff adds 496 pounds to the GT63’s already comically high curb weight, for a new grand total of 4,839 pounds. That’s more than a double-cab Toyota Tacoma.
While the extra poundage is easy to feel, the E Performance isn’t lacking in cornering speed. The steering is very quick and pleasantly smooth, helped by standard rear-steer and those excellent Michelins. This Mercedes possesses tons of poise through big and small bends alike, carrying tons of speed with little effort. That’s thanks in part to the standard AMG Active Ride, which forgoes traditional sway bars for a set of interconnected hydraulic lines that open and close depending on driving conditions, widening the range of damping for the uprights to deliver unprecedented performance for a car this heavy.
There’s also the improved weight distribution. Tobias Roll, head of product development for the SL and GT, told us the E Performance comes out to 51/49 front-to-rear versus 54/46 for the standard car, because of all the rear-mounted hybrid equipment. It’s tough to feel a difference in that balance without driving the two cars back to back, though, especially when both cars are already so heavy. You can have fun in this one, sure. But it’ll never be as joyful around a corner as something with half the weight and a quarter of the power. (Do that math and you won’t be surprised about which car fits those parameters.)
Corner carving isn’t what GT63 E Performance buyers are looking for. Those customers will go for the GT63 Pro, a trim made specifically for track work sporting more cooling and aero. The person who buys an E Performance buys it because it’s packed with the latest and greatest technological advancements you can find in a car. Because it has seemingly unlimited amounts of customization available. And most importantly, because it has the biggest number on the spec sheet.
That sheet will include the biggest price, too. While Mercedes has yet to release pricing, we expect the E Performance to start at around $216,000—or about $30,000 more than the standard car. As an all-around sports car, the Porsche 911 Turbo S is probably a better choice. But for ultimate high-speed highway domination and long-range grand touring, there’s nothing better on the market right now.

Mercedes Bricks The AMG One PHEV If The Engine Is Turned Off Prematurely,https://www.motor1.com/news/727380/amg-one-freezes-if-engine-prematurely-turned-off/,It happens if the V-6 is shut off six times in a row before it reaches the optimal temperature.,2024-12-25 08:51:49,"Putting an actual F1 engine in a street-legal hypercar was no easy feat for Mercedes-AMG, but they finally did it. The One hypercar was introduced in September 2017, and after many engineering hurdles, production started in August 2022. F1 champion Nico Rosberg ordered his in 2018 but had to wait six years to collect the car. A new video reminds us just how finicky this F1 car for the road really is.
You've probably heard the story about how the turbocharged 1.6-liter V-6 has to be rebuilt once every 31,000 miles. Well, there's more to it than that since the AMG One's startup procedure must be obeyed to the letter. Nico Rosberg made the mistake of shutting off the car prematurely before the engine reached its optimal temperature.
Had he done this six times in a row, Mercedes would have bricked the car, preventing him from using it again. Then what? A One owner would have to ring up Mercedes and ask someone from AMG to come with a laptop and unfreeze the car. Talk about first-world problems...
It takes 5-8 minutes for the combustion engine to reach optimal temperature if the car is stationary. Driving it around lowers the wait time to 2-5 minutes. It's worth noting the hypercar always starts in fully electric mode. The ICE doesn't kick in until the catalytic converter reaches 932°F, a process that takes anywhere from 60 to 90 seconds. During this time, the AMG One effectively behaves like an EV.
Once the combustion engine comes alive, the fastest production car around the Nürburgring becomes impressively loud. So much so that Mercedes-AMG delivers the hypercar with noise-canceling headphones because some might find the 120 decibels overwhelming. It was even louder during the development process but the engineers eventually managed to make it slightly more civilized. There's no fake engine sound being pumped through the speakers. It's all mechanical.
Mercedes-AMG CTO Jochen Hermann told Rosberg that getting the software right was the most challenging part of the lengthy development process. From previous statements made by company representatives, we learned that lowering the engine's idle speed from the F1 car's 5,000 rpm to 1,250 rpm was also a huge undertaking.
Hermann admitted the AMG One was the most complicated car to develop in the history of Mercedes and he believes it will never be replicated. The German brand has already ruled out doing another F1-powered road car ever again due to stricter emissions regulations. Only 275 units of the AMG One are being hand-built and Nico Rosberg is not the only F1 driver who signed his name on the dotted line. David Coulthard is also on the list.
As if the AMG One wasn't special enough already, Nico's has a black three-pointed star at the front that took 16 layers of paint, all of which were applied by hand.

Ford: EV Goals Were 'Too Ambitious' In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/727296/ford-ev-goals-too-ambitious-europe/,That means gas engines could stick around past 2030.,2024-12-25 08:51:51,"Over the last few years, Ford made an aggressive push to get more EVs on the road—as did many automakers. But as we've seen elsewhere, companies are starting to roll back EV plans as customer demand wanes. Ford is the latest to admit it might have been too aggressive in its EV push.
In an interview with Autocar, COO of Ford's Model E electrification division, Marin Gjaja, said that the company was overly ambitious with its EV plans in Europe. ""I think customers have voted, and they told us that was too ambitious,"" Gjaja noted. ""We don't see that going all-electric by 2030 [in Europe] is a good choice for our business or, especially, for our customers.""
2025 Ford Capri
Ford announced in 2021 that it had plans to make its entire European fleet electric by 2030, but this is the second report that recently surfaced suggesting Ford will slow those plans. In May, Ford of Europe's General Manager Martin Sander told Automotive News that gas engines could continue on past 2030. ""If we see strong demand, for instance for plug-in hybrid vehicles, we will offer them.""
In this case, Gjaja cites slowing EV adoption and rising costs as the main reasons for the recent rollback. Currently, Ford only sells two EVs in Europe: The Explorer EV and the Mustang Mach-E. The new Ford Capri will go on sale later this year.
Ford hasn’t made any statements regarding its EV plans in the US. But the company did recently announce that it will expand production of its Super Duty trucks in Canada—which will include a hybrid option—and we know that more hybrids and plug-ins hybrids aren’t off the table.

Watch The Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Conquer The Nurburgring,https://insideevs.com/news/727315/porsche-panamera-nurburgring/,"Porsche claimed a record as the fastest ""top-class"" sedan with a hybrid powertrain. Here's how it went.",2024-07-21 09:00:59,"The new Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid is a beast. With 771 horsepower from its hybrid powertrain, it's the most powerful Panamera you can buy. Porsche already sent it around the Nurburgring, lapping the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 24.17 seconds.
Now, we have a first-person perspective of the entire lap thanks to this in-car video recently published on YouTube.
Frankly, the lap doesn't look nearly as fast as it actually is. Porsche development driver and Nurburgring veteran Lars Kern appears borderline relaxed in the driver's seat as the scenery flashes by. There's very little drama, even on the fastest sections of the track. The Panamera reaches 173 mph heading into Schwedenkreuz, the infamous fast left-hander approximately two miles into the lap. We've seen many cars get skittish through here, but the Porsche remains remarkably composed.
For that matter, things stay composed even through the more demanding stretches of the loop. The back half after Karussell is nothing but fast turn after fast turn, and the Panamera doesn't flinch. Airing things out on the main straight, Kern gets the sedan to 190 mph—well short of its 202 mph top speed but enough to cement the 7:24 lap time. Again, it's all done with shockingly little drama.
Kern is certainly skilled behind the wheel, but credit also goes to a new aerodynamics package that pumps up downforce and the Active Ride chassis that manages pitch and roll, among other things. Aside from a racing seat and a roll cage for safety, the Panamera was completely showroom stock. That includes the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.
Porsche claims a record as the fastest ""top-class"" sedan with a hybrid powertrain. It's not the fastest sedan to lap the Nordschleife, but we suspect company executives are too upset by that. The all-electric Taycan Turbo GT holds that honor at 7 minutes, 7.55 seconds, set earlier this year. But given Porsche's fondness for Nurburgring records, we bet this isn't the last time we see a Panamera hustling around the storied race track.

This Is The Most Powerful Porsche Panamera Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/727030/most-powerful-porsche-panamera-ever/,The pricey Turbo S E-Hybrid arrives alongside a new GTS.,2024-12-25 08:51:53,"Days after setting a Nürburgring record, the hottest Panamera of them all is official. Porsche debuted the Turbo S E-Hybrid equipped with an electrified V-8 engine making serious power. Not only is it more potent than its predecessor but it also comes with a substantial battery upgrade. Sticky tires, a carbon fiber aero kit, and a rich list of standard equipment boost its appeal.
At the heart of the range-topper is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter engine making 591 horsepower. Built into the eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, the electric motor belts out another 187 hp. Together, the two deliver a combined 771 hp, lending the new Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid a substantial 81-hp advantage over the old model. At the same time, torque has jumped by 96 pound-feet to a mountain-moving 737 lb-ft.
Courtesy of the extra electrified muscle, the flagship Panamera is now two-tenths of a second quicker to 60 mph by completing the task in just 2.8 seconds. Flat out, it hits 202 mph, making it 8 mph faster than the old one. But wait, it gets even better. Porsche has increased the gross capacity of the battery pack by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, resulting in a higher electric range.
Sitting at the top of the food chain, the (takes a deep breath) Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid gets the good stuff as standard. The ceramic brakes are included from the get-go, as are the forged 21-inch centerlock wheels. There are still a few boxes on the options list you can tick, namely an aero kit and Michelin tires. The former increases downforce by 132 pounds at 124 mph while the latter is a bespoke Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber.
Porsche is already accepting orders and wants an eye-watering $228,495 before options. If that’s out of your price range, the Panamera lineup also adds a GTS trim for the 2025 model year. The Gran Turismo Sport costs a more attainable $156,195, with both prices including destination and handling feels. While the Turbo S E-Hybrid is the most powerful of the lot, the GTS is claimed to be the most agile.
2025 Porsche Panamera GTS
The Panamera GTS packs 493 hp or 20 hp more than the previous generation. It needs 3.6 seconds to hit 60 mph from a standstill, so it's a tenth of a second quicker. At full tilt, it does 188 mph. Compared to a more plebian version, the GTS sits 0.4 inches lower after tweaking the standard air suspension. In addition, the engineers from Zuffenhausen have beefed up the anti-roll bars and worked on the limited-slip differential for a more engaging drive.
Both new flavors of the Panamera will reach US dealers near the end of Q1 2025.

Ferrari's First EV Debuts In 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/726965/ferrari-ev-2025-debut-confirmed/,Ferrari’s CEO promises it’ll make the EV “in the right way.” It goes on sale in 2026.,2024-12-25 08:51:55,"Ferrari will reveal its first electric vehicle before the end of 2025. We know little about it, and that will probably remain the case until it debuts—unless Ferrari wants us to know something. In the meantime, the automaker is making big, somewhat vague, promises to its customers about what they should expect from the new EV.
Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told Autocar that its EV prototypes, with comically fake exhaust tips, have already completed over ""several thousand kilometers"" of testing, assuring that, ""When we do electric cars, we will produce them in the right way."" He called the car’s test drivers its ""first clients"" who have driven a lot of vehicles and can easily compare the EV to others. According to Vigna, people don’t buy a Ferrari for one particular thing—they buy it to have fun.
Ferrari EV test mule spy photo
Part of that experience will be the sound, a core Ferrari attribute that will radically change with its first electric vehicle. Vigna said earlier this year that Ferrari’s EVs will have unique “sound signatures,” but he didn’t elaborate. The company patented an exhaust note in 2023. Vigna said he was open about the possibilities EVs could allow with sound and feel—look at the programmable Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.
And Ferrari customers who still want combustion shouldn’t worry. Vigna said customer demand will determine what powertrains it produces—combustion, hybrid, or electric. He said forecasting sales based on powertrains was “an act of arrogance” and lacked “respect to the client,” adding that the company will never discuss sales splits.
The EV’s output and price will likely remain closely guarded secrets leading up to its reveal. Vigna wouldn’t confirm recent reports that the EV would cost $500,000, calling it “a surprise.” The company doesn’t set the MSRP until a month before the car launches, but no one expects it to be cheap. Ferrari’s electric car officially goes on sale in 2026.

Pagani Is Still Working On An Electric Hypercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/726824/pagani-electric-hypercar-development/,Just don't expect it anytime soon.,2024-12-25 08:51:56,"It’s still unclear when we'll see an electric Pagani hypercar. The supercar maker has been exploring the idea of an EV for over five years, but it still has numerous concerns about the technology. Pagani says it could water down what makes its cars so special. But the company hasn't given up on the idea, either.
Christopher Pagani, the founder’s son and Pagani’s marketing director, told CarBuzz that it hasn't abandoned the idea of an EV yet. ""We loved working on the electric car, and we still are working on this project, so it's not a closed chapter for us,"" he told the outlet.
But Pagani also noted that an electric hypercar is about more than just straight-line speed. ""For us, the performance is [in] the vehicle dynamics. It's not the amount of horsepower. It's not the top speed.""
Pagani Huayra Epitome
The company hasn’t produced a full-scale working prototype yet, and in 2023, Christopher said that the current battery technology is too heavy for the EV that Pagani wants to build. The company hopes to innovate in the space when it does deliver such a vehicle.
A Pagani EV probably won't happen anytime soon, even if the company believes it’s a worthwhile endeavor. Despite that, Pagani dealers aren’t interested, and they’ll be the ones selling it.
Pagani isn’t alone in seeing a growing disinterest in electric hypercars. Mate Rimac said earlier this year that high-end customers are already shying away from such cars, desiring combustion engines and an analog driving experience. As electric vehicle prices fall and go mainstream, wealthy clientele will want to differentiate themselves from the masses, which should help to give Pagani and its competitors plenty of business for years to come.

Here's Why The Lotus Evija X Crashed At Goodwood,https://www.motor1.com/news/726807/lotus-evija-x-hypercar-goodwood-crash-explained/,"Too much torque and not enough traction, essentially.",2024-12-25 08:51:56,"Last week at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a rare Lotus Evija X race car crashed off the starting line of the hill climb. The nearly 2,000-horsepower electric hypercar barely made it a few feet before ending up nose-first in a barrel of hay. But now we know exactly what happened.
According to Lotus—which offered more detail to the Goodwood Road & Racing website—the driver turned off traction control, which sent all 1,257 pound-feet of torque to the wheels in an instant. In the first few feet, the rear wheels were spinning at 170 miles per hour and the front tires were moving at 150 mph. The driver attempted to save the car from spinning by lifting off the throttle, but the balance of the car shifted, which sent it headlong into the hay barrels.
Instant torque combined with all that tire speed and no traction or rev limiter was a recipe for disaster. The entire incident lasted about 1.5 seconds from start to finish. Thankfully, the driver (who remains unnamed) walked away unharmed.
""Following a formal evaluation by both Goodwood and Lotus, asymmetric grip caused by overcorrection during rapid acceleration at the start line was determined to be the cause,"" Lotus told us in a statement earlier this week. ""The driver was unharmed in the incident and there was minimal damage to the car.""
It should be noted that the Lotus did complete a successful run of the hill climb earlier in the week. And traction control was turned off for that initial run. Unfortunately, the Evija X was never able to complete a timed run of the Goodwood hill climb following this incident.
Had it completed a timed run, the Evija X could have been one of the fastest cars of the weekend. It recently set a record at the Nordschleife for being the fastest car with a production chassis. With a lap time of 6 minutes and 24 seconds, the Evija X was third only to the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo and the Volkswagen ID.R.
Too bad we weren’t able to see that speed on display in Goodwood.

Damn: MG's New Electric Sports Car Concept Looks Good,https://www.motor1.com/news/726298/mg-cyber-gts-concept/,The hardtop electric coupe shows its face at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.,2024-12-25 08:51:58,"The MG Cyberster is a neat electric sports car that evokes the classic MG roadster. A hardtop version was just revealed at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed, though for now, it's only a concept. Say hello to the MG Cyber GTS.
Details are slim, but MG does more than simply add a fixed roof to the Cyberster. There's a 2+2 layout inside, but the car doesn't appear any longer or wider than its open-roof, two-seat sibling. The fastback blends wonderfully to the rear where we find a small ducktail spoiler atop familiar Cyberster taillights. The rear fascia incorporates a more aggressive diffuser, with prominent winglets on the corners of the front end. It suggests MG sees the hardtop as more of a track-focused fun machine.
That take is supported by MG's inspiration for the Cyber GTS Concept. In the late 1960s, MG built six MGC GTS Sebring race cars. Modern MG, which is now part of SAIC Motor in China, says the concept pays homage to these cars. It's also a nod to MG's 100th anniversary.
As for power, MG specifically mentions the Concept being rear-wheel drive. No other details are mentioned, but it's safe to assume a production version would utilize the Cyberster's single-motor layout. In the roadster, it generates 335 horsepower and uses a 74 kWh battery, enough to be lively despite its 4,000-pound curb weight. The dual-motor all-wheel-drive Cyberster is a couple hundred pounds heavier, but horsepower jumps to 503.
For a concept, the Cyber GTS looks like something that could enter production tomorrow. It's nothing like the EX181 Concept, which MG also debuted at Goodwood. Modeled after the original EX181 land speed record car from the 1950s, MG calls it a ""unique piece of automotive art"" that envisions what a modern version could look like.
Both cars are on display at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed, taking place July 11-14.

Porsche Is Taking a Huge Risk,https://www.motor1.com/features/725925/porsche-kill-cayman-boxster-macan-risk-opinion/,"The gas Boxster, Cayman, and Macan account for a third of Porsche sales. Soon they'll be gone.",2024-12-25 08:52:00,"Porsche won't invest in a new generation of the Boxster and Cayman with combustion engines, nor will we see a new generation of the gas-powered Macan. That means the good folks in Zuffenhausen are ready to let three of its most popular gas cars ride into the proverbial sunset.
The 718 models were already retired in Europe due to the General Safety Regulation (GSR2) that came into effect last week. In a statement to Motor1 earlier this year, Porsche 718 spokesperson Oliver Hilger said keeping the Boxster and Cayman in Europe just was ""not possible.""
Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS
""Implementation of the directive not only requires adjustments to the technical implementation, for example in the control units, but essentially also a change to processes in the development phase,"" Higler notes. ""For example, management systems will have to be developed and certified with regard to cybersecurity. The management and documentation of cybersecurity risks are tracked, structured, and formalized over the life cycle of the vehicle. All this could not be taken into account in the development of the 718 combustion models, as none of the requirements were known or applicable at the time. It is not possible to do this 'in reverse' without further ado.""
The mid-engine models will live on outside of the EU, but not for long. This week, Porsche's production manager Albrecht Reimold said the last Boxster and Cayman with gas engines will be assembled in mid-2025. The Macan (also gone in Europe due to GSR2 legislation) will stick around a bit longer in other regions. Reimold said the crossover will remain in production until 2026.
But sales show that Porsche's decision to phase out three popular gas cars is a risky bet.
Porsche Boxster
In 2023, Porsche delivered 87,355 Macan SUVs to customers, while the Boxster and Cayman were shipped to 20,518 clients. Considering the German automaker sold a total of 320,221 cars last year, the 718 and Macan accounted for a little over a third, at 107,873 units.
The numbers for the first half of 2024 are nearly the same. Porsche sold 39,167 Macans while the 982-generation sports cars achieved 11,886 deliveries. With a total of 155,945 cars shipped to buyers through June, the popular crossover, coupe, and convertible models once again represented roughly a third of volume, at 51,053 units.
The electric Boxster and Cayman will come out in 2025. But it begs the question: Will enthusiasts warm up to the idea of not having a combustion engine? Going EV means the manual gearbox will also become a thing of the past. Regardless of how good the electric replacements are, Porsche will probably lose customers who would only otherwise buy a performance vehicle with ICE power.
Pricing could also be a problem; History has taught us that EVs are almost always more expensive than the equivalent combustion car. Killing the conventionally powered 718 will mean that buying a two-door Porsche with a gas engine is going to get significantly pricier. Right now, a base Cayman is $74,795 after destination and handling fees. The cheapest 911 starts at $122,095. It's a $47,300 difference that will likely alienate many buyers.
Porsche Macan GTS
Although the gas Macan is still around (for now), its electric successor is already here. Deliveries to customers are scheduled to start later this year. It makes more sense for the crossover to embrace the EV trend than the 718s, but that comes with a price hike as well. You can have Porsche's smallest crossover with a combustion engine for $64,895, whereas the entry-level electric model is $80,450. That's nearly a $16,000 gap between the two.
Since EVs are still significantly more expensive to produce, it remains to be seen whether Porsche will be able to match the profit margins of the outgoing ICE cars. It's too late now for the company to change its mind. With emissions regulations getting stricter, we wouldn't hold our breath for a new gas-only sports car. Even the Mazda Miata lost its 2.0-liter engine in Europe.
Could Porsche have done things differently? Well, company officials made it clear that updating the current 718s to meet regulations would have been a costly endeavor. In the case of the Macan, there are also issues regarding the availability of certain parts, according to Reimold.
While most purists probably won't care about the lack of a gas engine in the Macan, ideally, we would have gotten another generation of the ICE Boxster and Cayman. But that ship sailed long ago; The EV replacement was announced in 2022.
Porsche is sticking with its objective to have EVs account for more than 80 percent of annual shipments by 2030. To get there, the next-generation Cayenne is also going to be an EV. In addition, another large SUV coming in the next few years will be electric-only. That SUV will be positioned above the Cayenne and will likely offer three-row seating.
Porsche Panamera
What about the Panamera? Taycan model line boss Kevin Giek recently told Autocar that an electric Panamera can peacefully coexist with the Taycan. He went on to say that a Panamera EV would cater to customers looking for a larger and more luxurious model while the Taycan targets those in the market for a sportier EV.
As for the legendary 911, it's not going to lose its rear-mounted engine this decade. There is a hybrid with the 2025 Carrera GTS, but a full EV won't happen before 2030. Porsche hopes synthetic fuels will give ICE a new lease on life. It's been producing eFuel from water and carbon dioxide using wind energy at a plant in Chile since late 2022.
At the beginning of the month, Reuters reported that the European People's Party, the largest lawmaker group in the European Parliament, wants to weaken the sales ban on new cars that emit CO2. The news agency obtained a draft document indicating the intention to loosen the rules pertaining to CO2 reductions.
2025 Porsche Cayenne GTS Coupe
According to Euronews, the European Commission has already promised to develop a legal route that would allow cars to run on synthetic fuel as long as the production process is carbon neutral. The last-minute change to the proposed legislation was done following pressure from Germany.
Regardless of how things go with the legislation, Porsche is pressing ahead with its EV agenda. Time will tell whether replacing several gas cars with electric models before the end of the decade, let alone by 2035, is the right move.

2025 Porsche 911 Review: A Hybrid Without Compromise,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/726006/2025-porsche-911-hybrid-first-drive-review/,Porsche engineers are very proud of its hybrid 911. They have every right to be.,2024-12-25 08:52:01,"Porsche's engineers insist the new 911 doesn’t feel like a hybrid. But how could it not? The new 911 Carrera GTS has an electric motor splined to the crankshaft of its flat-six, plus a massive electric turbocharger. It took me a little bit of time behind the wheel to figure out what they meant—Porsche’s new hybrid 911 does feel like a hybrid, just not like any hybrid before it.
Long rumored, Porsche debuted its new hybrid powertrain with the facelifted 2025 911 Carrera GTS. It uses a 1.9-kilowatt-hour, 400-volt lithium-ion battery pack under the front hood to power a 53.6-horsepower motor paired to a new 3.6-liter flat-six with an electric turbocharger. The turbo has a 14.7-hp motor situated on the shaft connecting the turbine and compressor wheels, which can accelerate or slow down the whole thing as needed. This means the turbo can limit boost pressure and put electrical energy back into the system. There’s no wastegate.
It’s not a plug-in system like basically every other performance car from Europe at the moment, and there’s no clutch between the engine and the electric traction motor, so there’s no all-electric driving either. In total, you get 532 hp and 449 pound-feet of torque, which runs through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission to either the rear, or all four wheels.
The goal here was twofold. Design a system that was as light as possible—the target curb weight for the new GTS was just over 3,500 pounds, and US-spec cars weigh 103 pounds more than their predecessors—and one that allowed the engine to run at the ideal air-fuel ratio of 14.7:1 at all speeds to comply with stricter European regulations. And, of course, it had to offer a meaningful performance boost.
We headed to southern Spain to sample the new 992 in the Andalusian mountains and on the Ascari race circuit. At first, there are only subtle hints that the GTS is a hybrid. The engine fires in an instant, the traction motor taking over the duty of a traditional starter and its typical chuga-chuga-chuga-whump; and from low revs in a high gear, there is occasionally a sensation of instant torque that you don’t get in a non-hybrid 911. I spent the first few minutes trying to find the point where the car does something that makes you go, “Ah! That’s not normal!” Except for fleeting moments, it’s not there.
In reality, it’s exceedingly difficult to suss out what the system is doing because it’s almost constantly shuffling electric power between the traction motor, the turbo, and the battery. There’s a display on the infotainment screen illustrating power flow, though it’s almost impossible to follow with how quickly power moves around.
It’s endlessly fascinating, but it also feels normal. If you shut off the part of your brain trying to figure out what the hybrid system is doing, you just experience excellent throttle response, and, well, the sheer speed of it all. We started the day in a Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet, and it hauls ass. There’s no big wallop of electric torque like you get in other performance hybrids, but smooth, prodigious, instant power delivery instead.
I can’t say it feels naturally aspirated, because the Carrera GTS is far too torquey. But it doesn’t feel turbocharged either because engine response is so good. It’s somewhere in between, and totally its own thing. The traction motor also does a lot at high engine speeds, coming in strong around 5,000 rpm to make the GTS’s flat-six wake up like a great naturally aspirated engine, compensating for the turbocharger as it starts to run out of puff.
What really gives the game away is the sound of the turbocharger. In Sport Plus mode, the car spools up the turbo more aggressively off throttle and under braking, and it makes all kinds of funky noises. Hit the brakes hard downshifting into a corner, and you can hear a whistle rising in pitch as the motor speeds up the turbo toward its 120,000-rpm maximum. Otherwise, it huffs and chuffs away as you get on and off throttle.
Chassis-wise, it feels very similar to the last Carrera GTS, which was the goal. Porsche widened the rear tires by 10 millimeters to 315 millimeters, the same size as the Turbo, and consequently changed some of the suspension components. The new engine is a bit narrower, which allowed Porsche to fit larger tires under narrower bodywork, and the extra power and torque demanded them. Porsche’s optional Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active anti-roll bars now run off the 400-volt system, too, so they work more quickly and precisely.
Essentially, the 911 GTS stops and turns as brilliantly as ever. Even this all-wheel drive Cabriolet feels keen to dig into corners, and traction is typically 911 immense. There’s not a ton of suspension travel, yet the damping is superb. It’s a car you get keyed into straight away, inspiring the confidence to hustle it on a mountain road. Unlike a lot of hybrid cars, the 911 Carrera GTS uses a conventional braking system, where the pedal only directly connects to the brakes. But under braking, the traction motor does do some amount of regeneration, which you can’t really feel.
Driving on track has a wonderful way of focusing the mind. There’s not really time to think about how the hybrid system is working when concentrating on hitting your marks, especially on an unfamiliar circuit. Ascari is interesting, too, a long, narrow, technical track with basically one of every type of corner, and here, we benefit from following an instructor in a 911 Turbo S.
In a situation like this, you want a predictable car. Its outputs must match your inputs. Despite its complexity, the Carrera GTS is never underfoot. It does exactly what you want when you want it.
I spent the first few minutes trying to find the point where the car does something that makes you go, ""Ah! That’s not normal!"" Except for fleeting moments, it's not there.
The hybrid system never crosses your mind here, which is a remarkable achievement. When you push the throttle pedal, it’s not simply sending a signal to the throttle body to open a certain amount. In an instant, the car has to make all kinds of decisions on how to use the engine and the hybrid components, and every time you go back to the throttle pedal—or come off it for that matter—the calculus changes. Yet, as a driver, you have no sense of this. You just get the torque when you want it.
Sure, the extra grunt of the system lets you use third gear to pull out of a chicane where you might have needed second otherwise, but there’s no penalty for revving it either. Just drive it as you would any other 911.
And as ever, the 992-generation 911 is a wonderful track car. Sweet handling balance, a talkative chassis, and mighty brakes inspire huge confidence, and the car feels like it’s ready to run all day. We sampled both rear-drive Carrera GTS and all-wheel drive Carrera 4 GTS, and frankly, it’s hard at times to tell the difference between the two.
Maybe the rear-drive version has slightly sweeter steering. But on turn-in and in mid-corner, the cars behave almost exactly the same. The all-wheel-drive system feels so subtle, the car obediently tucking the nose with a lift of the throttle, yet providing even better traction to pull the car straight at corner exit. Jorg Bergmeister, the Porsche factory driver who helped develop the new car, says the big differences between the two are only really evident when you’re far over the limit of grip.
All of the cars on hand for lapping had optional $9,780 carbon-ceramic brakes, which Porsche enlarged for the extra power. The front brakes and 10-piston(!) calipers are off the 911 Turbo, while the rears are unique to this car. In the great Porsche tradition, they are unflappable, stopping the car over and over again without a hint of fade and with seamless ABS engagement. Pedal feel is also superb, helping the driver meter out exactly how much pressure you need on initial application and as you bleed pressure off on turn-in.
On track, we also got a chance to sample the base, non-hybrid 992 Carrera for a few laps. It definitely feels lighter than the GTS, and yes, you obviously notice the relative lack of power. But, with 388 hp from a revised 3.0-liter twin-turbo flat-six, the Carrera is still plenty quick, and for a lot less money than the GTS, you get the vast majority of the 911 goodness. It’s a sweetheart.
The rest of the changes for this facelifted 992 are pretty minor. A digital gauge cluster brings more functionality, but it’s far less elegant than the analog tach of the previous model. The looks are subtly different, but integrating all the light functions into one unit helps clean up the front end. And there’s a push-button for starting the engine, which doesn’t have the same sense of occasion as a key. Things Porsche people may probably care about too much, but ultimately don’t matter.
A tougher pill to swallow is the price. Porsche is quick to point out the additional standard equipment and performance, but the Carrera GTS coupe starts at $166,895. Even the base Carrera, which isn’t all that different from last year’s model, rises in price by almost $8,000 to $122,095. And all of the GTS models we drove were specced beyond the $200,000 mark.
Really, this facelift is all about the hybrid. Porsche is rightfully proud of it. Its engineers are rightfully protective of the 911, and they feel like this is the best solution for the sports car. Porsche’s hybrid system is far lighter than any of its competitors’ systems, and it effectively meets the needs of increasing performance and response while dealing with more stringent regulations.
I still contend it feels like a hybrid because it feels different from the previous Carrera GTS. Yet, I get what the engineers are saying. This feels like the first truly no-compromise performance hybrid out there.
More importantly, it feels like a 911.

Dead: The Gas Porsche Boxster and Cayman,https://www.motor1.com/news/725828/porsche-boxster-cayman-ice-die-2025/,"The duo won't be around by the end of 2025, and the Macan with combustion engines will be retired in 2026.",2024-12-25 08:52:03,"Earlier this year, Porsche was forced to retire the 718 Boxster and Cayman in Europe due to new cybersecurity regulations. The Macan with gasoline engines suffered the same fate. However, the sports car duo and the crossover are still available to purchase outside of the EU. Even so, the writing is on the wall for these models equipped with combustion engines.
Porsche's production manager Albrecht Reimold told Automobilwoche the Boxster and Cayman will go out of production by the middle of next year. Porsche is pressing ahead with the all-electric replacement, which he has already driven, and promises it'll be a ""real fun car."" No further details were released, but judging by spy shots, the convertible is likely to come out first.
Another Porsche with gas engines facing the chopping block is the previous-generation Macan. While the all-new EV successor is already out, the old sporty crossover is still sold outside of Europe. Reimold says that by the middle of 2026, the company will be ""fully committed"" to the electric successor. Limited availability of parts is accelerating the ICE model's demise.
Increasingly stricter regulations in Europe are also another nail in the Macan's coffin. Reimold mentioned it wouldn't be financially feasible to invest in a 10-year-old car, even though it's one of the best-selling products: ""Volume alone is not a benchmark for us as a luxury manufacturer.""
Judging by 2023 sales, the impending demise of these three cars is likely to have a huge impact on deliveries. The 718 lineup grew last year by 13 percent to 20,518 units while demand for the Macan remained at the previous year's level, with 87,355 vehicles. The smaller of the two Porsche SUVs was almost the top seller, trailing behind the Cayenne by fewer than 200 units.
The electric Macan has more chances of luring in buyers who would've opted for a gasoline engine. It remains to be seen how enthusiasts will feel about not having an engine behind the seats of a Boxster/Cayman. We won't be too surprised if the outgoing 718 will benefit from a sales surge while the gas engines are still offered. That said, the models are gone from Europe, so Porsche can only dream of reaching the sales performance of 2023.

You Can Buy A New Toyota Mirai For Half The Price,https://www.motor1.com/news/725500/toyota-mirai-50-percent-discount/,Not convinced yet? You can even get it with zero percent financing for 72 months.,2024-12-25 08:52:03,"When the automaker admits one of its products has ""not been successful,"" you know there are deals to be had. Toyota is trying to lure people into buying the slow-selling Mirai by shaving off a whopping 49 percent from the hydrogen sedan's original price tag. The Limited trim is now $33,000 cheaper than the MSRP of $67,115. Cars Direct got a hold of a bulletin sent to dealers, and this discount is confirmed on Toyota's website.
To sweeten the pot, the massive price reduction can be combined with zero percent financing for 72 months. Stick to the base XLE trim and Toyota shaves off a substantial $25,000 from the original $50,190 sticker. This cash incentive can also be combined with zero percent APR on the entry-level Mirai.
To sweeten the pot, Toyota also throws in $15,000 worth of hydrogen fuel for six years. That means a Mirai Limited buyer can save as much as $48,000. A Mirai XLE with the fat cash incentive combined with the complimentary fuel brings savings of $37,000.
Exactly how bad are sales? There's no point in beating around the bush–they're awful. Through June, Toyota only sold 245 cars in the United States, representing a decline of 85.8 percent compared to the first six months of 2022. Last month, only 20 vehicles changed hands. Despite sluggish sales, the company pledged its long-term commitment to hydrogen tech in an e-mail sent to Motor1 several months ago.
Toyota is not the only Japanese brand offering a hydrogen car in the United States. Honda recently launched the CR-V e:FCEV as a plug-in hybrid since the crossover also features a rechargeable battery pack. Alternatively, South Korea's Hyundai Nexo Fuel Cell is still available. Of the three, only the CR-V e:FCEV is built in the US.
Elsewhere, BMW will decide later this year whether it'll build a hydrogen car. If that happens, it'll go on sale before the end of the decade, paving the way for more models planned to arrive in the 2030s.

Hop Inside This Mercedes-AMG One As It Hits 215 MPH On The Autobahn,https://www.motor1.com/news/724812/mercedes-amg-one-215-mph-autobahn-video/,"Turns out 1,049 horsepower is more than enough for big triple-digit speeds on the world's fastest highway.",2024-12-25 08:52:04,"The AMG One hypercar was made to carve corners. Mercedes says it's a Formula 1 car for the road, after all. But having 1,049 horsepower means straight-line speed is also immense. Here's proof.
The Gercollector YouTube channel filmed a recent outing with their own Mercedes-AMG One as they took it to Germany's Autobahn highway, where there is no speed limit. There, the car was able to reach a maximum speed of 347 km/h (215 mph) before having to slow for traffic. That is incredibly fast.
All those horses come courtesy of a 1.6-liter turbocharged V-6 lifted from AMG's Formula 1 program, paired to three electric motors (two at the front, and another at the rear attached to the engine). The engine can rev up to 11,000 rpm, and because there's next to no sound-deadening inside, you can hear every last ignition.
AMG says the top speed for the One is 219 mph, but considering just how hard the car was pulling when the driver had to lift off, we suspect the true top speed is even quicker. With a curb weight of around 3,700 pounds and moving active aero that can tuck away to eliminate drag, we could see the AMG One breeze by 225 mph with enough space, judging by this footage.
Just as cool are the noises the AMG One makes. In addition to the wailing V-6, the car delivers a satisfying e-motor whine to the cabin as it cruises leisurely through the German countryside while in its all-electric mode. There's also the gearshift clunk as the car moves its way up the bespoke sequential transmission.

The Maserati GranCabrio Is Better As An EV,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/724899/2025-maserati-grancarbio-ev-first-drive-review/,"Driving the electric GranCabrio back-to-back with its gasoline-powered twin, it immediately becomes clear: Get the EV.",2024-12-25 08:52:05,"Listen. Don't buy an electric car if you live somewhere where charging is a hassle. Don't rely on an EV if you regularly drive further in a day than a fully charged battery can take you. And definitely don't buy an EV you can't afford.
Barring all of that: If you’re in the market for a new Maserati GranCabrio, do yourself a favor and get the all-electric Folgore. It simply lives up to the grand-touring ideal better and more elegantly than its gasoline-powered twin.
The 2025 Maserati GranCabrio comes in two varieties: The Trofeo, powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine making 542 horsepower, and the Folgore, with three electric motors making a standard 760 horsepower—with a short burst of up to 1,200 horsepower. Both models are all-wheel drive. At a sumptuous drive program on the shores of Lake Maggiore, where Northern Italy brushes up against Switzerland, Maserati introduced us to both versions of the all-new four-seat convertible.
The gasoline-burning Trofeo gets its power from a lightly finessed version of the Nettuno engine that first debuted in the MC20 supercar. This engine, with its unusual 90-degree layout, is compact enough to sit entirely behind the GranCabrio’s front differential, which allowed Maserati to snuggle the engine down lower than you’d typically see in an all-wheel-drive car. (It also let Maserati head of design Klaus Busse draw the clamshell hood nice and low, the way it should be on a sports car).
Utilizing precombustion-chamber technology adapted from Formula 1, the GranCabrio Trofeo makes 479 pound-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm and pulls authoritatively right up to its 6,500-rpm redline.
The combustion-powered Trofeo can sprint from a stop to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds, on the way to a 196-mph top speed. On the hairpin-heavy, sometimes alarmingly narrow mountain roads of the Italian Alps, the gasser never ran out of breath. There’s no soft spot in the Trofeo’s powerband. There’s just a steady rush as mid-range torque hands you off to top-end horsepower.
The Nettuno engine sings baritone, a scale that starts at a loping, bassy burble and ends in a classic sports-car rasp, accentuated by a multi-mode exhaust (and a little airbrushing via stereo-system enhancement) that gets progressively louder as you dial the drive-mode knob from GT to Sport to Corsa. With the cockpit closed, you’ll never hear a whisper of turbo noise, but roof-down days add an undercurrent of whooshing air to the music.
Here’s the thing: With its relatively low 6,500-rpm redline, the GranCabrio Trofeo upshifts right as the soundtrack gets exciting. The gearbox is the ubiquitous torque-converter eight-speed manufactured by ZF and installed in seemingly everything but washing machines and cement mixers. Left on its own, it upshifts obsessively, pushing the tach needle down below 2,000 rpm where the engine’s roar becomes an unenthusiastic groan. There are paddle shifters, of course, roughly the size and shape of a scrawny banana. Shifting for yourself, you can keep the engine in its ideal vocal range, but you’ll never be able to ignore the slight lag between shift request and gear change.
You look at a car like the GranCabrio, with its pouncing silhouette and athletic curves, and you imagine yourself driving every mile heroically, upshifting at redline and cracking off burbling downshifts into Alpine apexes, the song of racing legacy echoing behind you. It’s a fantasy. Most of us spend the brunt of our driving days farting along from place to place, hemmed in by traffic, bad roads, and the law. That’s why if you’re eyeing the GranCabrio, I suggest you opt for the all-electric Folgore.
Viewed by the rigid metric of straight-line performance, the Folgore is the obvious choice. Thanks to 995 lb-ft of instant torque, the BEV convertible does zero-to-60 in 2.8 seconds, according to Maserati, and sprints the quarter-mile in 10.6 on its way to a 180-mph top speed.
Unlike nearly every other EV on the market, the GranCabrio Folgore doesn’t have a floor full of batteries—the 92.5-kilowatt-hour pack is T-shaped, fitting inside the transmission tunnel and behind the passenger compartment, repurposing space demanded by the combustion drivetrain. This let Maserati keep the electric GranCabrio deliciously low-slung and helped the Folgore achieve a perfect 50/50 front/rear weight distribution.
Like most BEVs, the GranCabrio Folgore weighs a ton—nearly two tons, actually. It’s 5,249 pounds in US spec, compared to 4,316 pounds for the gasoline-powered Trofeo. It’s also mostly silent, emitting a distant, low thrum that rises with speed. What were once shift paddles now control regenerative braking, adjustable between three levels but never quite strong enough for true one-pedal driving.
Here’s the part that feels slightly like magic: On a winding mountain road, the all-electric Folgore handles almost identically to the dinosaur-burning Trofeo. Both take a curve with no perceptible body roll, the steering is light, and the brakes linear and accurate. Each car uses electronic dampers that firm up in Sport mode and go one notch further in Corsa, which sends the height-adjustable air springs down to their lowest ride height.
Our Italian test route was defined by annoyingly high-quality pavement, the stuff American drivers only see during daydreams or European vacations. When I could find the occasional pothole or frost heave, the GranCabrio had great compliance even in its firmest setting. Occasionally, Corsa mode delivered a ripple of flinty high-frequency motion, eliminated by hitting the damper button, which adjusts between firmer and damper sub-settings within each drive mode.
The GranCabrio, of course, is the drop-top sibling to the GranTurismo coupe. Grand touring, as a concept, is not about ultimate, hair-on-fire speed. It’s about effortlessness, elegance, and the ability to dispatch hundreds of miles at a time with grace and pace. Functionally, just about any brand-new car on sale today can take you long distances in relative comfort, so our definition of grand touring needs a 21st-century update. Speed? Absolutely. Power? Undoubtedly. But to truly tour grandly, you need stylish nonchalance. The Italians have a word for this—sprezzatura. Get there fast, and make it look like nothing. The all-electric Folgore is dripping in sprezzatura. Always powerful, never shouting about it.
Sure: If Maserati offered a clutch pedal and a gated shifter in the GranCabrio, I’d tell you to get it. But that would be a different kind of machine, one defined by the work it demanded of its driver. With the GranCabrio Folgore, you can rocket your way up the Alps and never have to raise your voice. Plus, where else can you get a drop-top EV? Even if a miracle happens and the Tesla Roadster arrives, it’ll never be mistaken for stylish.
The GranCabrio is not perfect. The back seats are more inviting than what you’d find in a Continental GT or 911, with just enough headroom for this six-footer to squeeze back there with the roof closed, but they’re still occasional-use-only. The trunk is decently sized for two people on a long weekend, slightly less so when you fold down the roof, which kicks out an expansion panel that eats up a little cargo space. Speaking of which: You open and close the convertible roof by swiping and holding your finger on the center-stack touchscreen, an unnecessarily fussy way to handle the task if, say, you’re trying to get out of a downpour.
The all-electric GranCabrio is not for everybody. Maserati predicts a relatively mediocre battery range of 233 miles and says you can get as much as 48 miles of charge in 5 minutes if you manage to find an 800-volt station. The navigation system automatically locates Maserati charging stations and shows your predicted driving range as a continuously updated radius, but we were not given the chance to test the charging experience on our one-day, two-vehicle drive.
And then, well… the electric GranCabrio costs $205,000, a whole 13 grand richer than the gasoline-powered Trofeo. Both models arrive in US dealerships this summer.
Right now, there’s really not anything out there that compares to the GranCabrio Folgore. Four-seat, drop-top performance EVs are a category of one. And that’s probably the ultimate expression of sprezzatura: Doing it in a way nobody else can.

Nissan Techs Are Making House Calls to Teach Owners How to Use Their Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/724924/nissan-second-delivery-program/,Does this mean there's too much tech in vehicles?,2024-12-25 08:52:06,"In case you haven't noticed, modern vehicles are packed with features and technology. Even the Nissan Versa—the cheapest new car in the United States—has a 7-inch touchscreen with voice controls and buttons all over the steering wheel. Step up to something like the Ariya and there's even more to suss out. The basics are usually straightforward, but figuring out all the tech can be intimidating. Nissan wants to change that.
The automaker is launching a new program called Second Delivery. It's essentially a no-cost follow-up visit for people who buy a new Nissan, designed to help them learn just what their car can do. A Nissan ""tech expect"" will coordinate a time and place to meet the owner, generally two weeks after the first delivery. That can be at the owner's home, work, a lunch stop at the local Starbucks, or the dealership where it all began. The expert will take the owner through all the vehicle's systems, step-by-step.
Such things are generally done during the normal delivery process, but the idea here is to give owners some time to acclimate to their new car before diving deeper. Details can also be missed during the big day, as owners are often excited to get on the road with their spanking-new ride. Listening to a salesperson prattle on about automatic headlight functions or adjusting climate settings through your phone may not stick the first time around.
""Now more than ever, customers expect a personalized experience that matches their wants and needs,"" said Dan Mohnke, Nissan VP of eCommerce and customer experience. ""These types of experiences are extremely important for us to offer for our Ariya customers, who are largely new to the Nissan brand and interested in using all of the latest technology.""
For now, Second Delivery is only offered on the Ariya, presumably because it's Nissan's most technologically demanding vehicle. The service ""is expected to expand"" later in 2024 to the Rogue and Leaf.

Volvo Email to Customers: EX90 Will Be Missing Features at Launch,https://www.motor1.com/news/724813/volvo-ex90-missing-features-delivery/,"Wireless Apple CarPlay, bidirectional charging, and a light theme for the displays could be missing when owners take delivery.",2024-12-25 08:52:07,"Volvo finally started production of the EX90 earlier this month after promising to deliver it to customers in early 2024. The automaker had to delay the EV's launch to fix some remaining software issues, and while deliveries still won't start until the second half of the year, the EX90 might not arrive in customers' driveways fully baked.
A reader passed along an email he'd received from the automaker with a link to a list of features ""that may be delayed when taking delivery of your EX90."" The list includes safety and convenience features, with the full capability and integration of the LiDAR system unlocked after a future update. Other features that might be missing include cross-traffic alert, curve speed assist, wireless Apple CarPlay, and bidirectional charging.
Owners will have to settle for the dark theme for the infotainment display and driver display for the foreseeable future, as the light theme will arrive in a future update.
They'll also have to be okay with the possibility the EV could lose about 3 percent of its battery per day when parked and not being charged. Volvo says the EX90's core computer has to run in the background right now to control its ""highly advanced functions,” but that'll be fixed by a future update. The energy use stops after 72 hours as the car enters ""a deep sleep mode to conserve battery power.""
Motor1 reached out to Volvo to ask when customers could expect to receive these paid-for features and much-needed updates. We'll be sure to update this article when we hear back.
In its email to customers, the company said that most of the missing features will arrive for free via over-the-air updates. However, some might have to bring their vehicle to a dealer, who Volvo will notify ahead of time.

Study: Nearly Half of EV Owners in America Want to Switch Back to Gas,https://www.motor1.com/news/724788/half-ev-owners-american-switch-gas/,Inadequate charging infrastructure is keeping people from buying EVs.,2024-12-25 08:52:08,"A few years ago, automakers started to roll out elaborate plans to convert their lineups to battery-electric vehicles. Some even set deadlines for ending gas-powered car production. But many are now reevaluating the future. Sales are slowing for some and not others, consumer interest is waning, and now nearly half of EV owners in America might switch back to gas. What is going on?
McKinsey & Co.'s 2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse study reveals that 46 percent of EV owners in the United States, well above the worldwide average of 29 percent, want to switch to gasoline cars because of the inadequate charging infrastructure. Thirty-five percent of global respondents said the public network isn't good enough yet. Thirty-four percent said EV ownership costs remain too high, while 32 percent said EVs impacted their driving patterns too much on long trips.
The US charging network is growing, which could eliminate these hurdles for owners. As of May, the US had 183,000 public EV chargers, but there still aren't enough. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 allocated $5 billion in grants toward building fast chargers, but the rollout is taking forever due to a myriad of local, state, and federal regulations and consumer needs.
Other reasons owners gave as to why they might switch back include the inability to charge at home (24 percent), the stress of worrying about charging (21 percent), and charging mobility requirements (16 percent). Only 13 percent said they did not enjoy the driving experience. Some people just enjoy driving a combustion car, like 18 percent of US respondents and 28 percent in Germany.
The study also reveals why automakers seem so disjointed from one another in their EV efforts. Growth and the desire to switch back aren't equal worldwide, and some markets are converting faster than others, putting automakers in a difficult position of attempting to cater to wildly varying needs across the globe.
Shockingly, Americans aren't the most eager to switch back to gas. In Australia, a country known for its vast interior, 49 percent of EV owners are considering returning to the pump. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Japan, where only 13 percent of owners might return to a combustion-powered vehicle. Other countries below the worldwide average include Italy (15 percent), France (18 percent), Germany (24 percent), and China (28 percent). Brazil joins the US and Australia above the average at 38 percent.

Mercedes Is Spending Big Money On Gas Engines Again,https://www.motor1.com/news/724830/mercedes-spending-big-money-gas-engines/,"""A lot more"" is being invested in the S-Class compared to a usual facelift.",2024-12-25 08:52:09,"After conceding that its electrification goals have been overly ambitious, Mercedes is now pouring an obscene amount of money into combustion engines. In an interview with German publication Wirtschaftswoche, CEO Ola Källenius said ICE technology ""will last well into the 2030s."" To make sure gas engines will meet increasingly stringent regulations, massive investments are necessary.
Just this year, the three-pointed star is spending €14 billion (about $15 billion at current exchange rates) on its passenger car division alone. The funds are reserved for ""high-tech combustion technology” but also electrification and digitalization. Although the Swedish-German business executive didn’t specify how much Mercedes is spending on ICE, he admitted it's ""more money than previously planned.""
Källenius brought up the S-Class and the flagship's mid-cycle update scheduled for 2026: ""We have invested a lot more in the model update of the new combustion engine S-Class than we normally spend on a facelift."" The goal for Mercedes is to have its conventional powertrains at ""the very highest technological level."" Without spending big money on gasoline and diesel engines, the luxury brand ""would suddenly stall our combustion engine business in 2027 or 2028.""
He was referring to Euro 7 and China 7 regulations and how the engines must be updated to run cleaner to meet stricter emissions rules. The goal is for Mercedes to tweak all ""relevant combustion engines and transmission combinations"" to avoid having to pay massive fines. Källenius mentioned future engines will be electrified to some extent, so expect even more hybrids in the lineup.
Mercedes knows it must adapt now that the transition to EVs isn’t going as planned. Three years ago, it said plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars would represent about 50 percent of annual sales by 2025. However, that’s highly unlikely to happen. At one point, the company even said it would go fully electric by 2030 in some countries “where market conditions allow.”
After being hit in the face by reality, Mercedes has no other way but to readjust its goals. It now wants hybrids and electric cars to account for half of deliveries by the end of the decade. The ultimate objective to become carbon neutral by 2040 hasn't changed, according to Källenius.
He refuted rumors about the company canceling the development of a platform for the next-generation EQS: ""The project is running at high speed."" In addition, it's not scrapping plans for the promised eight gigafactories to build batteries to support its electric ambitions. However, the facilities will be ready ""a little later"" than originally planned.
Since we mentioned the EQS, there was an interesting report earlier this year about how Mercedes was testing its stately electric car with a range-extending combustion engine. The big EV was allegedly fitted with a tiny two-cylinder, 1.0-liter turbocharged engine mounted at the front. However, trials were supposedly stopped.
Mercedes does have a deal with Geely to jointly work on hybrid engines that will go into Volvo models as well. The Chinese automotive giant has expertise in range-extenders, including a separate deal with Renault. The newly formed Horse division specializes in combustion engines, including those developed as range extenders.

The Future Is Bleak. The Kia EV9 Proves It Doesn't Have to Be,https://www.motor1.com/features/724674/kia-ev9-sustainable-future-feature/,"I loaded up a Kia EV9 with friends, drove to the coast, and there, I found hope.",2024-12-25 08:52:09,"The city of Seattle was an environmental disaster from the moment it was founded in 1851. Its primary industry in the middle of the 19th century was the overzealous logging of 40-story-tall, millennia-old trees. (Its secondary industry was prostitution.)
Seattle’s first sewage system dumped directly into the Puget Sound, and high tide frequently flooded low-lying city streets with raw human waste. In the 1940s, hydrocarbons (and smog) from coal fires reached a crescendo, and massive fish die-offs occurred in Grays Harbor as factories dumped toxic anaerobic runoff into the Pacific Ocean. By the late 1960s, the city of Tacoma semi-permanently reeked of rotten eggs, a byproduct of pulp-plant pollution.
On July 1st, 1970, Washington established the Department of Ecology, the nation’s first environmental agency.
Fifty-four years later, I’m driving 250 miles around the Sound to the Olympic Coast, and without burning a single hydrocarbon. I took five of my friends with me in a three-row electric SUV powered by renewable energy. I vacationed on pristine beaches and walked in preserved ancient rainforests to discover how we built this better world out of the disasters of yore, and what it can teach us for the future.
Seeking a better future has long felt impossible for me: I am a millennial. The headlines—ecological and otherwise—have been bleak for my whole life. Since college, I’ve assumed I would have front-row seats to the seemingly inevitable collapse that runaway global warming would precipitate, and the past few years’ violent weather has only reinforced those worries: I’ve personally had to flee life-threatening climates half a dozen times in my life—first from hostile weather, then from hostile politics. It has felt like the walls are closing in, and hope of a better future is rapidly dwindling.
I’m not an aberration. According to Pew Research, most Americans believe climate change is currently hurting Americans, and roughly two-thirds believe the climate will worsen in their lifetimes. A majority are anxious about the future of the planet, but only 38% are optimistic that the problem can actually be addressed. This fear echoes broadly through our society. Polling shows that large majorities of Americans believe the country will be more unequal, less unified, and weaker by 2050.
Americans can seemingly only agree on one thing: We’re headed for a precipice.
The women in my car have lived their adult lives immersed in these feelings, for another common trait unites us: We are all transgender. Half of us relocated to Seattle within the past three years to escape the red states we lived in, when the institutional bigotry became too much for us to handle. Before I moved to Seattle, I lived in rural Idaho. I had taken to reading the state legislatures’ bills every day for its entire session, just to ensure nothing suddenly changed in my legal status.
The dire future is not abstract for us. It has already shaped how we live today.
This influenced our choice of locale. Our destination was Kalaloch Lodge, a rustic series of cabins constructed from driftwood perched on the cliffs of the Pacific, at the edge of Olympic National Park. The lodge proudly proclaims on its website that there is no cell signal at Kalaloch, and no internet available in the cabins. The only visible nod to modernization since it was first built in 1953 is a handful of Level 2 EV chargers, provided free of charge for guests with electric cars.
Around the Lodge is nothing but National Park and Forest land, a protected seashore, and an ocean preserve. Notably absent: civilization. We could completely unplug from our phones—and the stress underpinning American life.
We’d earned it.
It fell to me to find a vehicle suitable for our journey. Options are virtually endless at every price point and demeanor imaginable… unless, of course, you want an electric SUV, where three-row options have stayed scarce, even as Americans grow increasingly accepting of battery-powered vehicles.
And I desperately wanted an electric SUV. A big part of Seattle’s beauty—and what made it the only American city represented in the UN’s Role Model Cities for ecological restoration—is that its power grid is almost entirely clean. 98% of Seattle’s electricity is fully renewable, largely supplied via a series of hydroelectric dams built during the New Deal era. Charging up an electric car in Seattle is as close to living in a post-carbon world as you can get in America, and the Kalaloch Lodge’s chargers promised to make the 200-ish mile journey doable.
There was one other motivation for an electric car. My non-car-enthusiast friends who accompanied me on this journey frequently experience automotive culture as a net negative in their lives. Often, the interests of drivers are pitted against those of the climate (or pedestrians, or transit, etc.), which makes the world of car enthusiasm seem indefensible to them. I wanted to show them that our vehicles could be part of building a better world, and a road trip in a carbon-free SUV felt like the best way to do that.
There are only a handful of options for a three-row electric SUV currently on the market.
There’s Tesla’s Model X, which has an almost unusably small third row, ostentatiously gimmicky doors, and a founder who explicitly hates me and all my friends. I ruled that one out pretty quickly. There’s the Rivian R1S, which has been well-reviewed as a would-be super-SUV competitor, with 1,000+ horsepower variants and sub-three-second dashes to 60.
The Kia EV9 intrigued me for the opposite reason. The EV9 is so normal. While it does carry over some of Kia’s retrofuturistic styling from the smaller EV6 in its front fascia and wild wheel designs, at a glance, it’s not all that different from a gas-powered Telluride.
It doesn’t boast four-digit horsepower or a rock-crawling package. It has three roomy rows and excellent cargo capacity, even when chock-full of passengers. It’s relatively affordable, with a base price of $54,900—dead-on average cost for a new EV. If it didn’t hum instead of rumble, you’d likely never notice it was even an EV. It seemed like the ideal companion for a road trip like this.
With an EV9 lined up and our journey set, we headed out towards the coast. The first leg consisted of a ferry ride across the Puget Sound. While it would have been technically possible to take our journey without riding a ferry, it was part of the fun and extremely easy—Washington State Ferries is the largest ferry operating service in America, and its regular service is incredibly scenic. The sparkling waters of the Sound set the tone for the rest of our trip into the unspoiled lands of the Olympic Peninsula.
Our route then took us down the northernmost end of U.S. 101, which encircles the Peninsula. I found the EV9 doing exactly what I desired from it, which was mile-eating comfort for everyone in the car. Some girls slept, some chatted; I kept the (Meridian!) sound system cooly playing 1960s blues and jazz as we snaked through some of America’s most stunning vistas.
The EV9 performed as I hoped it would—stoically composed. As the driver, I found it perfectly acceptable for a three-row SUV; The main things I remember from our drive were my companions, the endless vistas, and the comfy seats, and that’s what I wanted to remember. Kia has not built a vehicle meant to take the spotlight; 1,000 horsepower may grab headlines, but my friends are what I want to focus on during a road trip. The EV9’s silent excellence complements day-to-day living, and it has shown a path forward for electrification in the process.
The sole snag on the journey didn’t come from the EV9 at all, but rather the dire charging infrastructure of America. I planned to stop in Forks, Washington—about 50 miles from Kalaloch—to top up the EV9’s battery, which had roughly 80 miles of charge left on it. While Kalaloch had chargers proclaimed on their website, I couldn’t be certain they’d all be working (or unoccupied). I didn’t want to get a press car completely stranded on the Pacific Coast without any cell service. Luckily, Forks had two sets of DC fast chargers.
Unluckily, that pair was a Tesla Supercharger and a Rivian Adventure Network station. Kia—which has announced a transition to NACS charging ports, but is still using CCS until the end of the year—isn’t including adapters on ‘24 models. I never thought to check this before leaving home and realized my charging-kit bag in the frunk had nothing to help me when I was standing at the Supercharger.
I had read about Rivian opening these once-locked-down DC fast chargers to every EV owner shortly before I embarked on the trip. What I didn’t remember was that those plans were for the back half of 2024. I arrived at the Rivian charger, attempted to plug in and scan a QR code, and the charging station let me know that it wouldn’t be dispensing a drop of juice to my Kia.
One panic attack later, I decided to forge onward to the lodge. Worst-case scenario, we’d make it to the hotel, but go without the car for a day while it trickle-charged on an outlet to give us enough juice to limp it to an actual charger. When we arrived at Kalaloch, I raced to the back of the lot and found the Level 2 chargers. All four were unoccupied, and three of them even worked. Crisis averted—but not before my choice of an EV had shaved a few years off my life from stress.
The rest of the trip proceeded without incident. We visited one of the only unspoiled temperate rainforests on the continent, saw tide pools full of starfish and anemones at Ruby Beach, and had a bonfire together on the shore of the Pacific. It felt like an ideal family vacation; I simply had chosen the family this time.
On the drive home, we stopped at the Satsop Nuclear Plant. Satsop was partially completed in the ‘80s by the Washington Public Power Supply System, but massive cost overruns led to voters pulling the plug before the plant was ever completed. The gargantuan cooling towers and reactor dome still loom over the small town of Elma, Washington; A business park has sprung up in their shadow, but there is no power generated.
When we arrived, it was overcast. The vacant gray landscape and looming towers, ordinarily, would feel post-apocalyptic to me. I’ve written a lot of fiction about the end of the world; It is the main thing I fixate on after a life of running from one hostile place to another, constantly struggling to stay ahead of seeming disaster. But despite the tumult America has experienced over the past decades, there are still pristine beaches. There are still ancient rainforests. I still ran on the sand with my friends. We can preserve these things because we have preserved these things despite all odds against them.
There is work to be done, to be sure. Electric vehicles will not cure our woes magically. But just as the waters of the Puget Sound were not cleaned overnight, America will not find its footing in a single election, charging will not improve without investment, and the way Americans relate to their cars—and move towards electrification–cannot change without effort.What this trip did show me, however, is a glimpse of a world where we can do it. We can still avoid the precipice and we have the building blocks to do it. We just have to keep trying.

E-Fuels Can't Work In Cars Until They Work In Planes. Here's Why,https://www.motor1.com/news/705067/efuels-future-explained/,HIF USA CEO Renato Pereira says his company can't rely on individuals to fill up on E-fuels at the pump.,2024-12-25 08:52:11,"At a time when wholesale EV adoption seems imminent, E-fuels represent a ray of hope for internal-combustion enthusiasts worldwide. In theory, an affordable, sustainable, readily available, and clean-burning fuel means internal combustion engines could live on indefinitely.
Just one problem; While E-fuels are already in production, it'll be ages before you can buy some at your local gas station.
""Right now, the costs [of producing E-fuels] are high,"" HIF USA CEO Renato Pereira tells Motor1. ""The costs are high because the equipment is new. That's brand new technology.""
HIF, or Highly Innovative Fuels, describes itself as the world's leading E-fuels company. It produces carbon-neutral fuels in several countries, intended for use in cars, boats, and planes. HIF's proprietary mixture, produced from hydrogen and CO₂ using wind energy, can run through gas-powered cars without any modifications to the engine, making it an appealing choice for enthusiasts who want to enjoy their internal combustion engines in an environmentally friendly manner.
It's a tantalizing idea, but reaching the point where HIF's E-fuels are cheap enough to offer to the masses is still likely years away, as the means to produce, store, and distribute the fuels are in their earliest phases. Average buyers can't subsidize the construction of these expensive production facilities; they'll demand an affordable, finalized product which doesn't yet exist.
""If you're an individual like you or me, you can say, 'I'm willing to pay a little bit more money [for E-fuel over conventional gasoline].' But we can't rely on that for the construction,"" Pereira tells Motor1. ""We either need a system through regulation or we need to support the construction of these production facilities [through investment] so that the costs can come down,""
""Every time you build a new facility, the cost goes down,"" he says.
Because these production facilities can take up to five years to build, HIF needs partners who are willing to commit to higher costs up front, before the facility is built.
""In order to build [these factories], we need a long-term commitment at a fixed price,"" says Pereira. ""So we need somebody to say, 'I'll pay you this amount for this fuel for 15 or 20 years,' and then we can rely on that commitment to go to the banks so they can lend us the money for those facilities.""
Porsche has pioneered in the E-fuel sector. The German carmaker has invested more than $100 Million into HIF Global since 2021 in return for a long-term stake. The money helped fund HIF's proof-of-concept facility in Chile. As a proof of concept, and to generate publicity, Porsche has used the clean-burning fuel in many of its special projects. On one recent expedition to the world’s highest volcano, Porsche set a record for reaching the highest altitude driven, courtesy of a highly modified 911 Carrera 4S running on E-fuel.
“We see ourselves as pioneers in E-fuels and want to drive the technology,” Porsche R&D board member Michael Steiner said in a 2022 statement. ""This is one building block in our clear, overall sustainability strategy.""
But it's not cars where the first proper E-fuels are poised to be used at scale, says Pereira. It's in ""no alternative"" modes of transportation, like transatlantic shipping boats and passenger airliners, where full-on electric propulsion adoption is extremely unlikely. It's in these industries where E-fuels have the biggest environmental benefit, as no massive investment to modify the existing methods of propulsion is needed.
Governments are beginning to realize the benefits. The European Union mandated that sustainable fuels should make up at least six percent of fuel pumped in its airports by 2030. By the year 2050, that number is required to be 70 percent. In the United States, a $1.25-per-gallon credit is awarded for sustainable fuel blends that reduce emissions by at least 50 percent.
""We have a clear market that we can serve,"" Pereira says.
Ironically, it's not the airlines themselves committing to these long-term agreements with companies like HIF, but rather traditional oil firms.
""The burden is mostly on the fuel distribution companies, the oil companies, because they're the ones who supply the fuel at the airports,"" Pereira tells Motor1. ""So we're going to them and saying, 'I have this fuel, please sign up on a long term agreement at this price that enables us to build this facility.'""
The hope for car enthusiasts, then, is that enough investment and government regulation leads to more factories, and in turn, proliferation of E-fuels. If ""no-alternative"" modes of gas-powered transportation (i.e. planes and boats) are pushed to E-fuels, either through regulation or market forces, prices will drop for all consumers.
Long-term, E-fuel manufacturers strive to reach a point where E-fuels are cheap enough to match or even beat conventional gasoline prices; It's the only scenario where E-fuels would be widely adopted by individuals, barring government intervention.
Considering the sloth-like progress of lawmaking and the length of time necessary to construct E-fuel production facilities, it's going to take a while for E-fuels to become mainstream. Pereira isn't sure when you might be able to pump your own sustainable fuel. Probably years but maybe decades. We'll be here, car keys in hand, eagerly waiting.

This Is Our First Look At Ferrari's New EV,https://www.motor1.com/news/724712/ferrari-ev-spy-photos/,Complete with comically fake exhaust tips.,2024-12-25 08:52:12,"Ferrari announced in late 2019 that it would not introduce its first electric car until after the middle of this decade. However, the market launch was moved forward in April 2021 when company chairman John Elkann said the car would come out by 2025. It's still on track for an official debut late next year. In the meantime, it might've been spied undergoing testing for the first time.
This strangely disguised test mule spotted by Derek Cornelissen looks like an oversized hatchback. Spotted in Maranello, the unusual vehicle appears to be wearing a modified body sourced from the Maserati Levante. However, it seems to have the headlights of a Ferrari Roma. We also can't help but notice the newly designed wheels, possibly missing the aero covers.
And yes, those quad exhaust tips hanging from the corners of the rear bumper are comically fake. The yellow high-voltage stickers indicate we are dealing with an electric vehicle. It's not the first time an automaker decides to slap a faux exhaust on an EV prototype as Porsche has been doing that for a while with the electric Boxster.
Just because Ferrari decided to use a Levante body doesn't necessarily mean the V-12-powered Purosangue is getting an electric companion. The company with the Prancing Horse has not revealed which shape its EV will take. We do know the mysterious car will be built at a new factory inaugurated this week at the existing base in Maranello. Seeing this test mule running around mere days after is probably not a coincidence.
Ferrari has promised its first EV will deliver an ""authentic"" noise, whatever that means. The car is rumored to cost over $500,000 per Reuters, although CEO Benedetto Vigna refused this week to confirm the report. He also refuted speculation claiming the new factory would push annual production from approximately 14,000 to 20,000 vehicles.
Although Ferrari is at the dawn of the electric era, it still plans to sell V-12 cars for as long as possible. Head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando recently said the twelve-cylinder powerhouse will remain in production until it is outlawed. However, the Italian exotic marque projects pure ICE cars will account for only 20 percent of annual sales by 2030. About 40 percent will be represented by plug-in hybrids, with the remaining 40 percent by pure EVs.
Meanwhile, the first EV is estimated to account for five percent of total shipments in 2026. Reuters alleges that a second electric car is in the works already, albeit in an early development stage.

Mitsubishi Might Bring Back the Lancer Sportback and Montero,https://www.motor1.com/news/724146/mitsubishi-lancer-sportback-montero-return/,But they'll probably be EVs.,2024-12-25 08:52:14,"In 2017, Mitsubishi revived its iconic Eclipse nameplate and promptly slapped it on the backside of an SUV. Sad. Now we're seeing new trademark filings for other iconic Mitsubishi names, like Montero and Lancer Sportback, that could also end up on unappealing models.
The former Montero nameplate hasn't been around in the US since 2006, but Mitsubishi recently filed a trademark for the Montero name with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The trademark specifies “automobiles” and dozens of other uses, so it's possible we could see the Montero name on a future Mitsubishi here in the US.
Mitsubishi filed a second trademark for ""Lancer Sportback"" that was initially refused by the USPTO, but is currently under appeal. The Lancer Sportback was the five-door version of the Lancer in the US that was introduced in 2010. This trademark appeal was filed in March, and specifies use for “automobiles and structural parts therefor.”
The Lancer Sportback trademark filing is especially interesting. We know that Mitsubishi is teaming up with Nissan to bring a handful of new hybrid and electric models to the US, including its own version of the next-generation Leaf. Rumors say the Lancer Sportback could be Mitsubishi’s version of the Leaf (if the patent is granted).
There are also rumors of a new Mitsubishi truck for the US and a production version of the D:X Concept (which could become the next Delica). But we’re taking all of these details with a grain of salt. We won’t know anything for sure until the first new Mitsubishi models start rolling off the production line sometime in 2025 for the 2026 model year.

I Designed A Hybrid Car. Now I'm Building It In My Garage,https://www.motor1.com/features/724024/lets-build-a-car/,Technology has put us on the brink of building an automobile with almost zero hard tooling. Let’s try it.,2024-12-25 08:52:15,"Eight years ago, I began a college degree in industrial design. I did it because I loved cars. It didn’t work out how I thought. About halfway through my degree, I realized that I didn’t want to design just the interior or exterior of a vehicle; I wanted to design the whole thing. As it turns out, that’s a gig that doesn’t really exist.
I finished my degree, pivoted my career out of design, and now I work as a journalist, writing about machines that extremely talented people have toiled over for years.
And there is a massive car-shaped hole in my life. Let’s change that.
I am going to build a car.
This project will be a little different than other custom cars because I will not be starting with an existing vehicle or fabricating almost any of the parts. Rapid prototyping technology has come very far in a very short time. Making an entire vehicle with almost zero hard tooling is possible. At least a lightweight hybrid sports car. If that sounds unreasonable, well, let me talk you into it.
Assuming it works, this vehicle will effectively be an open-source kit car, theoretically buildable by almost anyone with a garage and the right tools. Every single part will have a precise specification and a supplier. Let’s talk about the actual specs, though.
The bones of this vehicle, like its chassis and suspension, will be custom. The engine, transmission, electric motor, and differentials are not. There are a handful of great engine candidates out there, but one in particular became the favorite: The 1.6-liter straight-six out of a BMW K1600 motorcycle. Many have theorized about putting this engine in a car and I know a few who have actually done it.
The BMW straight-six is a great engine. It makes 160 horsepower via natural aspiration, has a six-speed sequential transmission, and revs out to 8,500 RPM. There are other good things about it too, but the sound and the power are the big ones. Think of it as half of the almighty BMW S54, which powered the E46 M3 from 2001-2006.
The 1.6-liter inline-six out of a BMW K1600 motorcycle
Because I chose this engine, getting the car working will be considerably harder. The most well-rounded candidate would’ve been a flat-four out of a Honda Goldwing. There are several advantages to using a Goldwing engine—especially an older carbureted one—over the six-cylinder in the K1600. However, I wanted to be sure that the internal-combustion drivetrain would be excellent regardless of the electric side of things. Many sporty hybrid cars get that wrong and I will not make that mistake.
A K1600 engine—purchased from eBay with around 20,000 miles on it—is now sitting in my garage. But there’s a big problem: It spins in the wrong direction compared to a car engine. Without addressing this problem, I would have six reverse gears and effectively no way to go forward. This is simultaneously a huge issue but also a pretty silly one.
There are several solutions, but I’ll simply be flipping my rear differential over to make it run backward, i.e. twisting it about the input shaft to put one output flange where the other used to be. A lot of people online say this is a bad idea. That’s almost the whole truth. I have spoken to people who have done it for other projects involving motorcycle engines and, as long as you use a strong differential, it should be fine for this sort of thing. I also spoke to an engineer at General Motors who has spent most of his career just designing gears—a very happy coincidence—and he said it’s ok to do as long as everything stays well-lubricated.
This engine will run on a standalone ECU, which I have never tuned with before. I have spoken to experts in the matter—aka the very helpful people from whom I plan to purchase the system—and they say it’s definitely possible. Stuff like the cam sensors, fuel injectors, and the crank trigger wheel all seem relatively conventional.
Let’s talk about the other half of this formula, though: the electric power.
You’ve probably heard of the E-Ray Corvette by now, and my kart is conceptually very similar. My front axle will be powered by an electric motor, a 35.0-kilowatt-capable unit that’s normally used in electric paramotor aircraft. It’s made by a company called Free RC Hobby, which is sponsoring this project. They offer several other more powerful motors that I could’ve used—and even controllers—but this one is lightweight and has the right characteristics to be hooked up to an automotive differential.
The 35-kilowatt motor, designed and built by Free RC Hobby, is typically used in electric paramotor aircraft. Its specifications make it ideal for lightweight cars as well
The front diff is out of an Audi A4. It provides a reduction gear and gets the power to the front wheels. I considered using two motors on the front axle—there are advantages to doing this—but a single motor is the best option for this application. I’ll cover this in a future installment, but in the meantime, if you see me at a bar, it’s best not to mention this stuff. I’ll talk for days.
Juice comes from a 72-volt nominal, 1.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack consisting of 30 prismatic lithium titanate cells in a 30S 1P configuration. It’s the big blue rectangle in the lead image. Made by Toshiba, Mazda uses the same cells in some of their vehicles’ mild hybrid systems.
Mazda uses these Toshiba LTO cells, also known as SCiBs, in some of their vehicle's mild hybrid systems. They're ideal for my purposes due to their high power density and stability
I’ve partially assembled this pack and it’s a very impressive unit on paper. It can push around 40 kW (53 horsepower) in a long burst, and charge quickly. Because of the relatively low voltage, the electric power will peter out around 50 miles per hour. With some modification—changing the motor or differential—this speed can be pushed higher at the cost of low-end performance. I’m happy with where the motor sits now, though. High speeds are not my priority as a matter of personal preference and safety.
Like the E-Ray, the pack sits in the vehicle’s structural center tunnel, which is a six-inch square aluminum tube. A ducted high-CFM radiator fan will allow for powerful air cooling through the tunnel and around the pack, but there’s space to add liquid cooling in the future if necessary.
The 1.4-kilowatt-hour pack sits at the front of the center tunnel, near the rest of the electric drivetrain
The great part about these LTO cells is they have a much lower internal resistance as compared to NMC lithium-ion cells, so they don’t get so hot under high current draws. They are also extremely safe—you can hammer a nail into them without much happening—and they can be cycled up to 20,000 times before significant degradation occurs. They’re a great hybrid battery candidate for these reasons and more, with the big caveat being energy density. I don’t need very much energy, though.
The key piece of this puzzle is the inverter to drive the motor. When you go to higher voltages, that becomes a more complex problem. I am avoiding this by nature of the vehicle, though, which I’ll expand on.
As of late, there are good candidates from Flipsky and Trampa that operate under 100V. They are all VESC-based which means the software is the same as what I have been using in the Motocompacto Type R and the quad-motor kart. I plan to have the inverter cooled by a large heatsink that resembles a shaker hood. I think that’s a cool way to show off the electric power. If this doesn’t work, I’ll cave and add radiators.
72V may sound like too little, even for a hybrid. That’s not the case. There are many excellent reasons to mate a relatively low-voltage hybrid system with a motorcycle engine in a car. The big one is that most motorcycles don’t have a reverse gear, and when people put bike engines in cars, they typically have to buy an expensive gearbox to compensate or improvise some kind of other solution. My electric drivetrain gives me a reverse gear, effectively.
Small motorcycle alternators may also struggle to provide the necessary juice to power lots of accessories. The K1600’s alternator is 700 watts, which should be plenty, but by placing a DC-DC converter between the car’s 12V battery and its 72V traction battery, you can use regenerated energy from the wheels to power onboard systems like cooling fans in a pinch.
A sealed DC-DC converter, made by Elcon, will enable the traction battery to send up to 1000W to the vehicle's 12V systems under high-load situations
There are other good reasons to go hybrid too, like less wear on the bike engine’s clutch starting off. The most compelling reason to do all of this is not technical, though.
All of this will make the car more fun to drive.
While interesting, most hybrid systems in production cars don’t provide the driver any ability to interact with or adjust the electric power delivery to their liking. This vehicle will not be like that. The level of regenerative braking and output power from the motor will be adjustable on the fly. I already know how to do this.
The way the electric power is put down, i.e. when and how the driver decides to use the selected power level, will also be configurable. I’m still deciding the best way to do that, whether it’s a sort of shift paddle, a button on the steering wheel, or integrated somehow with the throttle pedal. In the end, integrating this functionality is not conceptually complex; it is just something that must be iterated upon.
The end result is an 8,500 RPM straight-six combined with a separate electric drivetrain that can be tuned to a user’s liking. The vehicle will likely be able to start like an LMDh car, accelerating up to speed under electric power and then bumping over the combustion engine. I’m not sure how pleasant that will be, but ultimately it will be up to the driver to start like that if they desire.
Since the car is light, the electric drivetrain can be light, too. My whole battery pack weighs less than 40 pounds, my motor weighs less than 12 lbs, and the inverter weighs less than 10 lbs. The heaviest parts of this vehicle by far are the combustion engine and differentials.
This is the magic. The car is already light because it’s small and powered by a motorcycle engine (the combined engine and transmission weigh just 226 lbs). The shortcomings of the motorcycle combustion setup are largely overcome by a hybrid system which, by the nature of the vehicle it’s installed in, can likewise be small and lightweight. The value this has for inverter selection should also not be understated. Going over 100V means getting into the territory of much more expensive and complicated hardware. I don’t need to do that because of my low power requirements.
On paper, it all adds up in a really nice way.
Until about a year ago, the chassis part of this vehicle would’ve been untenable. A big part of this project is that I want to do very little fabrication personally. This will make it less about my own personal skill and allow everything to be repeatable for inspired readers. I think other people who are smarter than me can expand on this idea even more.
If this method of production sounds silly, well, it just isn’t anymore. The same sponsor of both the Motocompacto Type R and the quad-motor kart, Oshcut, can laser-cut square tubes big enough to make a complete aluminum chassis. In fact, my current progress is shown below. The only chassis component I will have to source from a different manufacturer is the roll cage. If you know of a business that can help me out with that, let me know.
The chassis consists of several bolted and bonded aluminum tubes. Some are not displayed in this image
The frame will be bolted and bonded together, similar to many other modern automotive structures. Small amounts of steel are located in key areas and will be coated or painted to prevent galvanic corrosion. The suspension, double wishbones at every corner, will have steel control arms, likely a mix of small metal 3D prints and laser-cut tubes, although I’m still iterating on this. Pushrod suspension is a convenient way to make space for the CV axles, which will have to be custom.
Body panels will be 3D-printed on a large-format FDM or SLA machine. The price of this technology has come down precipitously in just a few years. Pieces like the door skins can be printed in a single shot, without gluing any smaller prints together. Larger pieces like the hood and rear clamshell are separated into smaller panels. These parts will either be primed and painted as they are or, more likely, skinned with a composite material like fiberglass to add strength. I have already gotten reasonable quotes for these pieces, but I am looking for as many as I can, especially in the United States. Please reach out if you know of one.
Below is a preview of the basic design, which I had rendered by a talented digital artist. The actual CAD of the body is changing as the design matures, so I don’t want to share exactly what it looks like at a granular level. At least not yet. It will look very close to what you see now, though:
I could go on, but this is just a primer. For the sake of (some semblance of) brevity, I won't discuss the interior in this post; That will be an exciting topic for a separate piece.
As I progress, there will be several more journal-type features about vehicle development. These updates will be large and small, sometimes written and sometimes presented via other mediums.
This whole idea probably sounds wildly optimistic, and I may seem unaware of the trouble that’s ahead of me.
You’re right.
I didn’t know how hard this would be when I started, and I cannot anticipate how difficult the path ahead is. For every problem I face, though, I do not find myself discouraged. I find learning and problem-solving to be absolutely thrilling.

The Electric BMW M3 Will 'Beat Everything',https://www.motor1.com/news/724126/electric-bmw-m3-beat-everything/,BMW M CEO Frank van Meel is eager to take advantage of the sedan's quad-motor setup.,2024-12-25 08:52:17,"While some automakers are changing their EV plans, BMW is marching ahead. The company will launch models using its Neue Klasse platform in a few years, including its high-performance M cars. Those worried about the move to electrification should feel some relief from BMW M CEO Frank van Meel, who claimed that the electric M3 will ""beat everything.""
He told Motor Trend that he is eager to take advantage of the car's quad-motor configuration due to the ability to control the drivetrain and the chassis ""with one central logic,"" creating a ""neutral, linear, and predictable"" performance car that should have the power to, well, beat everything.
BMW Neue Klasse EV Concept
Frank Weber, BMW's head of engineering and R&D, has already hinted at the car making one megawatt of power, or 1,341 horsepower. The M car will feature unique battery chemistry and cooling, in-house designed e-motors, an 800-volt architecture, and special software to run it all.
The automaker is also considering a lighter rear-wheel-drive variant that offers a different driving experience. Half the motors likely mean half the power and 670 hp is still a lot. We might also get an electric M3 Touring riding on the new architecture, but all the fun stuff is still a few years away. The Neue Klasse-based 3 Series arrives in 2026, followed by the M3 in 2027. The wagon would likely come after that, closer to the decade's end.
How much will this super-machine cost? We don't know, but we hope the price doesn't also beat everything we have ever seen. Bold cars backed by bold claims often come with equally bold price tags

2026 Bugatti Tourbillon: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/723757/2026-bugatti-tourbillion-debut-specs/,"It has 16 cylinders, 3 electric motors, and a top speed of 276 miles per hour.",2024-12-25 08:52:27,"This is not another Bugatti Chiron derivative. There's certainly a striking resemblance to the old W-16-powered hypercar, but this a completely new beast. The monocoque is new. The suspension is new. And the hybrid V-16 powertrain is most definitely new. Say hello to Bugatti's next-generation 1,800-horsepower flagship, the Tourbillon.
The previous reports about the engine were true—this is an 8.3-liter monster that revs to 9,500 RPM and makes 1,000 horsepower without any turbochargers. Cosworth helped develop the naturally aspirated beast, which weighs just 555 pounds despite being significantly larger than the W-16 it replaces. There's also 664 pound-feet of torque, but of greater interest here is the other half of the Tourbillon's powertrain.
We're talking about the hybrid assistance. A front e-axle carries two electric motors, with a third motor positioned at the back to help spin the rear wheels. A 25 kWh centrally-mounted battery pack supplies power, adding 800 hp to the mix. The combined output is 1,800 hp, and provided the bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have enough grip, the Tourbillon will reach 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.0 seconds.
But that's not a proper metric to convey the Tourbillon's true performance. Under full throttle, 124 mph is reached in around 5.0 seconds. 186 mph arrives in a mere 10 seconds. The top speed of 236 mph happens in less than 25 seconds, unless you have the special Speed Key installed. When activated, the Tourbillon keeps its ginormous rear wing hunkered down while the speed climbs all the way to 276 mph.
The latest Bugatti doesn't lose anything in becoming a hybrid, except a little bit of weight. Yes, despite a battery pack and electric motors, Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron. It can also cruise around town without using that snazzy V-16 engine. Actually, it can go beyond town with an estimated EV range of 37 miles. There's no mention of speed on electric power, and Bugatti isn't ready to talk about charging times. But it uses an 800-volt system, and lest we forget, Mate Rimac is steering Bugatti these days. And he knows a thing or two about electric performance.
Watch connoisseurs will recognize tourbillon as mechanical bits used in high-quality timepieces to increase accuracy. Bugatti sees its Tourbillon as a big, timeless work of mechanical perfection. That becomes readily apparent when you open the electrically actuated dihedral doors to see the stunning analog interior. Three large dials affixed to the steering wheel display everything from speed to engine revs, fuel quantity, engine temperature, and more. There isn't a screen in sight.
The gauges were designed and crafted by Switch watchmakers, and they're permanently fixed to the steering column so they remain stationary as you turn the wheel. Meanwhile in the center console, you'll find banks of aluminum switches, rotary dials, and a single crystal lever that starts the V-16. The purpose of all this is to give the Tourbillon a timeless look, but there is a hidden digital screen at the top of the center console. On command, it will rotate up and give the driver access to Apple CarPlay, among other things.
As for the design, there's no mistaking it for a Bugatti. The Chiron-esque exterior features a special diffuser that begins just behind the passenger cabin, virtually hidden from view. Vents under the headlights help funnel air to the large side intakes. The horseshoe grille feeds air to radiators while also augmenting downforce. The active rear wing can deploy upward to serve as an airbrake. And it all rides on a completely new multi-link suspension that is 45 percent lighter compared to the Chiron's bones.
""The development of the Bugatti Tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of Bugatti history and the words of Ettore Bugatti himself,"" said Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac. ""His mantras ‘if comparable it is no longer Bugatti’ and ‘nothing is too beautiful’ were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the Bugatti hyper sports car story.""
Though we're seeing the car today, that era won't begin until 2026 when the first of 250 production cars will be delivered. Right now, the Tourbillon is currently in its testing phase, so start saving those pennies. You'll need every single one, because the Tourbillon's starting price is 3.6 million Euros (around $3.9 million at current exchange rates).

This Tiny EV Destroyed A Mercedes-AMG One Track Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/723933/mcmurtry-speirling-hockenheim-record/,It was 14.1 seconds quicker around Hockenheim.,2024-12-25 08:52:28,"With a lap time of 1 minute and 38.5 seconds, the Mercedes-AMG One is the fastest production car with a license plate around Hockenheim. However, it's no longer the fastest car overall around the challenging German track because the tiny but mighty McMurtry Speirling has shaved off a whopping 14.1 seconds. It completed a lap of the Grand Prix (GP) course in 1 minute and 24.4 seconds.
The diminutive EV has been crowned the fastest closed-wheel car around Hockenheim after beating not just the AMG One, but even a DTM race car. It improved the old record established in 2020 during a qualifying session for the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters by 3.9 seconds.
But it's not exactly a fair comparison since the Speirling is a purpose-built, track-only machine with a single seat and racing slicks. Nevertheless, it's an impressive feat considering the AMG One is essentially an F1 car for the road while the other is a DTM-spec racing machine. Not only that, but the pint-sized electric car only utilized 75 percent of available power and downforce since the run was done with a validation prototype.
The hot lap was performed on June 8 with former F1 driver Max Chilton behind the wheel. He also set the lap record at the Goodwood Festival of Speed while piloting the very same ultra-fast EV. He completed the hill climb course a couple of years ago in a blistering 39 seconds that will be hard to beat.
At 135.8 inches long, 62.2 inches wide, and just 40.1 inches tall, it makes the Miata look like a Super Duty by comparison. It weighs less than 2,200 pounds, so it’s even lighter than an ND-generation MX-5 while packing roughly five times more horsepower. McMurtry quotes a peak output of around 1,000 horsepower, all of which is channeled to the rear wheels.
While the range isn’t mentioned, it's not really all that relevant since the sole purpose of this car is to deliver neck-snapping acceleration. Although it’s a microscopic vehicle, the engineers have crammed in a 60-kWh battery the owners can charge in less than 20 minutes. We're being told that a fully juiced-up battery lasts for 10 laps of Silverstone at full throttle.
Having access to this ludicrous performance doesn't come cheap as the McMurtry Spéirling costs a whopping £895,000 before taxes and delivery fees. At current exchange rates, you’re looking at about $1.13 million. Only 100 units will be made and the plan is to start deliveries to customers in 2025.

The Electric Ferrari Could Cost Over Half A Million Dollars,https://www.motor1.com/news/723799/electric-ferrari-price-rumor/,Another EV is reportedly in the works.,2024-12-25 08:52:29,"The best-kept secret in Maranello these days is the Ferrari EV. The first Prancing Horse without a combustion engine remains almost a complete mystery. All we know so far is that it will be built at a new factory in the company's hometown and is scheduled to come out in the last quarter of 2025. Reuters has heard from sources familiar with the matter the electric Italian stallion will cost at least €500,000.
That works out to about $537,000 at current exchange rates. However, prices vary greatly around the world due to regional taxes, so a direct conversion isn't always accurate. Whatever the case may be, the rumored asking price is for the base version, but hardly any owners buy a Ferrari with zero options. The alleged asking price converted to dollars would make it roughly as expensive as a regular SF90 Stradale, not the hardcore $890,000 XX.
Reuters' source has also heard through the grapevine that a second Ferrari EV has already entered an early development stage. After the Purosangue SUV and the first electric model, adding yet another model to the lineup might hurt exclusivity. To avoid brand dilution, it is believed the company intends to limit production to no more than 20,000 vehicles annually, at least for a while.
Sales have gone up consistently year after year, reaching 13,663 units in 2023. People are willing to patiently wait years to take delivery. Last November, CEO Benedetto Vigna mentioned that the order books were at record levels, so much so that the production output for 2025 had already been sold out. It means newly placed orders won't be fulfilled until 2026 at the earliest.
To avoid becoming an SUV brand, Ferrari has limited annual production of the Purosangue to 20 percent of the total output. The high-riding model starts at around $400,000 and would likely sell even better without any restrictions in production. With a new plant on the way, more cars will roll off the assembly line. The most exciting of the lot will be a hypercar expected to break cover later this year.
As for the inaugural EV, Ferrari head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando recently said it'll have an ""authentic sound"" and will be a ""true Ferrari."" In 2026, the unnamed model is projected to account for about five percent of total sales. EVs are expected to represent 40 percent of all annual shipments by 2030.

"Ford's 1,400-HP Electric SuperTruck Could Break a Pikes Peak Record",https://www.motor1.com/news/723624/ford-lightning-supertruck-pikes-peak-powertrain/,The automaker beat the previous record last year by nearly 37 seconds.,2024-12-25 08:52:30,"Ford hopes to set another record at this year’s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The automaker beat the previous record by nearly 37 seconds last year in the SuperVan 4.2, and the company is returning with the F-150 Lightning SuperTruck. Ford showed off its wild aerodynamics late last month and now has details about the EV’s powertrain.
The SuperTruck used three STARD UHP 6-Phase Motors that make more than 1,400 horsepower combined, more than the SuperVan 4.2 that Ford campaigned at last year’s event. However, it sounds like it’s below the SuperVan 4.0, which made 1,972 hp. Power comes from an ultra-high-performance Li-Polymer NMC battery.
Ford replaced the truck’s camouflage wrap with a proper red, white, and blue livery, and its design screams extreme aerodynamics. The automaker claims the pickup can generate 6,000 pounds of downforce at 150 miles per hour.
The Ford features prominent aerodynamic features such as its colossal three-piece front splitter and the gigantic, swan-neck rear wing. It also has ducts where the headlights should be, side diffusers, hood ducts and louvers, and a massive rear diffuser that barely hides the fully custom, in-board suspension system. Pirelli P-Zero tires, wrapped around magnesium forged wheels, provide the grip, with carbon-ceramic brakes behind them.
It’s also all business inside the Lightning, where there’s a bare carbon-fiber floor, a racing seat, a steering wheel, a small display, and not much else. A makeshift center console holds two rows of buttons that control various vehicle functions.
Racing driver Romain Dumas will pilot Ford’s entry once again. He drove the SuperVan 4.2 up the course last year, setting the new record in the Open Class with a run of 8 minutes and 47.682 seconds. Ford should set a new record with more power on tap in the SuperTruck. The hillclimb happens on June 23.

The New Fiat Grande Panda Proves Fun Designs Aren't Dead,https://www.motor1.com/news/723316/2025-fiat-grande-panda-debut/,It comes with a choice of hybrid or electric power.,2024-12-25 08:52:32,"Although Fiat's European lineup is aging, at least it's significantly more diverse than what we get here in the United States. Aside from the 500 and 500X, there's also the Tipo hatchback and wagon. There are also hot Abarth models, like the 600X crossover, and the cutesy Panda. The latter is now joined by the new Grande Panda, a larger and mechanically different vehicle.
The Grande Panda is an addition to the family rather than a replacement for the current Panda, which will stick around until at least 2027, at which point it will have been 16 years old. As the name of the newcomer implies, it’s much grander than the old car. It’s 157 inches long, making it about 12 inches longer than the third-generation Panda launched all the way back in 2011.
It's still a diminutive car by American standards but considerably more substantial than before. The jump in size is not a real surprise since the boxy crossover is essentially Fiat's version of the new Citroen C3 sold in Europe. It looks a lot funkier than its French connection, sending concept car vibes even though this is a production model.
The cheerful Fiat Grande Panda embraces the pixel motif that might make you think of a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Those front LED daytime running lights have a chequered pattern. It's a recurring theme that you'll also notice inside the taillights. The Italian brand went to town with squares and 90-degree angles, which is refreshing to see in an automotive world dominated by swoopy designs and curvy lines.
Those 17-inch wheels with a diamond-cut design have a central ""X"" to compliment the light signature at the front and rear. Plastic cladding around the wheel arches makes the Grande Panda look more rugged, as do the chunky roof rails. Rather than using an old-fashioned badge at the back, an oversized Fiat script is debossed into the tailgate. The Panda lettering is hiding in plain sight on that black horizontal strip connecting the taillights.
The Grande Panda will be sold with hybrid and electric powertrains, presumably the same ones available for the Citroen C3. Expect a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine with three cylinders, a mild-hybrid setup, and a dual-clutch, six-speed automatic transmission. The gas is good for 100 horsepower while the electric motor provides a temporary boost of 28 hp. However, that e-motor only delivers 12 hp during acceleration.
The fully electric Grande Panda might inherit the 113-hp motor from the e-C3, along with its 44.0-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for a 199-mile range. Citroen also intends to sell a cheaper 124-mile e-C3 from 2025.
The Grande Panda won’t be a Euro-only affair as Fiat wants to sell the new model in the Middle East and Africa as well.

The First Electric Ferrari Will Deliver An 'Authentic' Noise,https://www.motor1.com/news/722841/ferrari-ev-authentic-noise/,But what is left after you remove the combustion engine?,2024-12-25 08:52:33,"It's been a little over three years since Ferrari did the unthinkable by announcing plans to launch an electric car. The first Prancing Horse with zero emissions is still on track for a late 2025 launch and it will make some noise, both literally and figuratively. Despite completely doing away with the ol' internal combustion engine, the EV from Maranello won't be completely silent.
While some electric cars such as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N make fake combustion engine noises and even have simulated gear changes, Ferrari is hinting at something different. Speaking with Australia's Drive magazine, Ferrari head of Product Marketing Emanuele Carando mentioned ""[the sound is] always authentic in a Ferrari."" He added it'll be a ""true Ferrari,"" although it's unclear what sort of sound it's going to produce.
The only way it's going to be an ""authentic” sound is if Ferrari is referring to the whine of the electric motor. The engineers could amplify it through the speakers, but that wouldn't be completely authentic anymore, would it? Whatever the soundtrack it will deliver, Maranello's first foray into the EV segment is set to ""deliver different emotions"" compared to the current crop of models.
An electric car is a huge deal, so it's understandable why Ferrari remains tight-lipped for now. It hasn't even announced what shape it will take but we do know it's going to be built at a new production site that's being finalized these days at home in Maranello. The unnamed model is projected to account for five percent of the company’s sales in 2026–the EV's first full year on sale.
The arrival of an EV won't seal the V-12's fate since Ferrari intends to keep the twelve-cylinder engine around until it is outlawed. Carando assures enthusiasts that deep-pocketed owners will be the ones who will decide whether they want a pure gas engine, a plug-in hybrid, or an EV.
Ferrari will beat archrival Lamborghini to the electric punch considering the latter won't launch the Lanzador, a 2+2 grand tourer, until 2028. By the end of the decade, Ferrari reckons 40 percent of its annual sales will be represented by cars without a combustion engine.

VW Will Spend Billions of Its EV Development Budget on Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/722457/vw-invest-billions-gas-engines/,A full third of its nine-figure EV budget will be used to keep gas engines relevant as the switch to EVs slows.,2024-12-25 08:52:33,"It's fair to say the transition to EVs isn't going as some automakers had projected. Several car manufacturers are delaying their lofty goals to become purely electric in the foreseeable future. Of the €180 billion ($196 billion) set aside in 2023 for research and development, the German brand said it would use more than two-thirds on ""electrification and digitalization.""
Arno Antlitz, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer at the Volkswagen Group, has now clarified where the remaining third will be spent. The company intends to invest roughly €60 billion ($65 billion) to ""keep our combustion cars competitive.""
Speaking at an event held by Reuters in Munich, the CFO and COO added that ""the future is electric, but the past is not over. It is a third and it will stay a third."" As a reminder, the previous plan announced in late 2022 mentioned VW would go fully electric in Europe from 2033.
Last year, VW brand boss Thomas Schäfer referred to ICE as being ""old technology"" in the context of e-fuels. He described the discussions surrounding synthetic fuels as being nothing more than ""unnecessary noise."" That's despite the fact fellow VW Group brand Porsche is actively involved in producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile.
Other high-end marques from the VW empire are also keeping a close eye on how sustainable fuels evolve. Bugatti is even thinking of designing fuel stations that could be installed at the owner's home and filled up with synthetic fuel. Lamborghini believes the combustion engine could be saved by making it run on something other than fossil fuels. Bentley is also exploring nearly carbon-neutral fuels.
Speaking of the Crewe-based marque, Bentley has pushed back its objective to become EV-only by 2030, delaying it by three years. Similarly, Ford no longer thinks it can go entirely electric in Europe by 2030. Aston Martin recently reversed course as well and will continue to produce cars with combustion engines into the next decade.
It's clear that more and more car companies are reevaluating their EV strategies as people aren't willing to let go of ICE just yet. Automakers are in quite a predicament because emissions regulations are getting tighter, requiring investments to make gas engines run cleaner. At the same time, the electric offensive from China is a cause for concern for global players.

Future Electric Lamborghinis Won't Imitate Combustion Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/722399/future-electric-lamborghini-imitate-combustion-cars/,Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer Rouven Mohr thinks maneuverability is more important than blistering acceleration.,2024-12-25 08:52:34,"Electric Lamborghinis and more advanced hybrids are coming. Whether that happens sooner rather than later is still uncertain, but the supercar brand isn't planning to simply swap gas for electrons and soldier on like nothing has changed.
That's the takeaway from a recent Top Gear report featuring Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer Rouven Mohr. He speaks at length about character in a future where the sound of an engine and the connection of a manually-shifted gearbox don't exist. To fill the void, he says companies like Lamborghini must be progressive in finding new ways to make people want cars. According to him, bonkers acceleration just isn't enough.
""Character is defined by other things,"" he told Top Gear. ""I think we have some cool ideas. In the next year or two we will showcase our thoughts. It’s far away from what your zero to 62 mph acceleration time is. That is not something that generates fun.""
It's a bold statement considering pretty much everyone looks at acceleration as a key metric for performance. And automakers love to brag about quick times—the faster you go, the more exciting the ride. Electric motors with instant torque are outstanding for delivering gut-punching acceleration, but Mohr suggests straight-line speed without the sound of an engine is an imitation of what's already been done. He envisions a future where the advantages of electric power are used in other ways to generate excitement.
That means handling. And we've already seen some of this in action with other automakers. Mercedes-Benz and Rivian both made headlines with tank turns—spinning electrically driven wheels in opposite directions to rotate the vehicle in place. Torque vectoring is something that's been around for decades, but the instant response of electric motors opens up new possibilities.
Mohr doesn't offer any details on what Lamborghini has cooking. Instead, he suggests the the company's Active Wheel Carrier tech combined with instant power management through electric motors could lead to a new level of maneuverability. Presumably, that doesn't mean a tank-turning Lambo.
Will we see some of this super maneuverability on the Huracan replacement? We'll find out in August when the new hybrid Lambo debuts later this year.

Subaru Explains How Its New Hybrid Boxer Engine is Better,https://www.motor1.com/news/722335/subaru-details-new-hybrid-engine/,Production of the next-gen hybrid powertrain starts this fall.,2024-12-25 08:52:35,"Some automakers are trying to save the manuals while others are attempting to rescue the internal combustion engine. Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru held a joint conference to explain how decarbonization can be achieved without going all-in on EVs. Toyota has three new smaller and more efficient engines in the works. Mazda is pursuing single- and two-rotor engines. Here's what Subaru is cooking up.
It has figured out how to keep its horizontally opposed engine alive in a next-generation hybrid system. During the conference, the company showed a prototype of its electrified boxer inside a camouflaged Crosstrek prototype. The outgoing setup relies on a parallel system where the engine and motor both power the vehicle. The new series-parallel layout will maintain a mechanical connection between the ICE and the wheels but the combustion engine will also serve as a generator to feed a battery that powers an electric motor.
Next-generation Subaru hybrid boxer engine
Subaru argues the new hardware brings notable benefits not just in terms of fuel economy but also in packaging. The engine, hybrid system, transmission, and transfer case are all housed together while the power control unit is located in the engine bay, without negatively impacting the size of the fuel tank. That allows the engineers to install bigger gas tanks to achieve a longer range.
In the old Crosstrek hybrid, the power control unit was mounted at the rear, so the fuel tank had to be downsized to make room for it. Thanks to the new arrangement, Subaru claims the fuel tank's size will be almost the same in the hybrid as in the regular gas-only model. Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Fujinuki touts a ""very long cruising distance."" During his speech, he said the new system must solve the ""current weakness in fuel efficiency.""
The company's CTO admits that if fuel economy is the ultimate goal, the boxer engine might not represent the ideal solution:
""If you were just going for efficiency, horizontally opposed engines are not necessarily always the best option. But what would Subaru be without them? When you think about it, we are the only mass-market brand making horizontally opposed engines today.""
Toyota also uses a boxer engine but only in the GR86 sports car, which is a sister model of the Subaru BRZ. Porsche has flat-four and flat-six engines but it's far from being a mainstream brand given how much their cars cost.
Subaru plans to start production of its next-gen hybrid boxer engine this fall at a factory in Kitamoto, Saitama at home in Japan. As you can imagine, the hardware is being conceived for all-wheel-drive applications.
Subaru High Performance X Future Concept
In related news, the company is working together with Toyota and Mazda on carbon-neutral fuels. To that end, it'll enter a WRX-based High Performance X Future Concept in the Super Taikyu racing series.
Since we mentioned Mazda earlier, the Zoom-Zoom company is doing things differently with the revival of its rotary. In the MX-30 small crossover, the engine doesn't actually send power to the wheels. Instead, the sole purpose of the transversely mounted rotary is to act as a generator to juice up a battery. An electric motor uses the harvested energy to drive the wheels.
Mazda is already working on a different layout for a longitudinally mounted two-rotor engine that could go into a new sports car, potentially an RX7 reboot it's ""considering.""

BMW Might Make an Electric M3 Wagon,https://www.motor1.com/news/722319/bmw-electric-m3-wagon-report/,But an electric M3 sedan will be out first.,2024-12-25 08:52:36,"BMW recently gave the M3 Touring a nip and tuck with sharper headlights and slightly more power. Plans are already in motion for a hardcore CS special edition scheduled for 2025 with lots of standard carbon fiber bits and another boost for the engine. Looking further ahead, rumor has it the M division is also cooking up a long-roof M3 without a combustion engine.
A well-known BMW insider familiar with Munich's agenda who has a good track record of getting things right claims an electric M3 Touring is planned. Posting on the Bimmer Post forums, the source alleges a performance electric wagon from Bavaria has been approved for production. Rather than being based on the CLAR platform as the current super estate, it'll be underpinned by the Neue Klasse architecture developed specifically for EVs.
The 2025 BMW M3 Touring with an inline-six engine
It's not coming anytime soon, though. BMW has announced it will launch a Neue Klasse-based 3 Series in 2026, with the electric M3 expected in 2027. Logic tells us the wagon will come after the sedan, so it's unlikely to go on sale before 2028. The same insider mentions the sedan has also been given the green light, along with a next-gen M3 with gas power. Interestingly, there's no word about a like-for-like replacement for the current M3 Touring with a combustion engine.
If you enjoy staying on top with BMW’s internal codenames, the gas M3 is supposedly called the ""G84"" while the electric model is ""ZA0."" The zero-emission M3 Touring is said to be known as the ""ZA1."" According to the same trusted source, the German luxury brand is also plotting fully electric M versions of the Neue Klasse-based X3 and X4. These are apparently referred to as the ""ZA5"" and ""ZA7,"" respectively.
As to what actual names these cars are going to have, BMW has already ruled out combining ""i"" with ""M,"" so don't expect iM3 or something to that effect. Oddly enough, the two letters have already been put together for electric M Performance cars such as the i4 M50, i5 M60, and the i7 M70.
The 2022 BMW Vision Neue Klasse previews the 2026 3 Series electric sedan and its M3 variant
BMW M boss Frank van Meel told Ars Technica a while back that the engineers are working on a dual-motor setup with rear-wheel-drive and a beefier quad-motor layout with all-wheel drive. The M3 models are reportedly getting the former setup, good for roughly 700 horsepower. It should be the same story with the M variants of the electric X3 and X4 since they’ll all be mechanically related.
It's too early to know whether the electric M3 Touring will be sold in the United States where the current performance wagon remains a forbidden fruit. Seeing the glass half full, America is getting the bigger M5 Touring scheduled to debut before the end of this year.

Mate Rimac Designed His Own Nevera and It Looks Rad as Hell,https://www.motor1.com/news/722099/rimac-ceo-designs-custom-nevera/,"He admits he ""wasn't the easiest customer.""",2024-12-25 08:52:36,"Fifteen years after founding the car company that bears his name, Mate Rimac has designed his own Nevera supercar. He admits he might not have been his company’s easiest customer, but the final creation is stunning.
He decided to show off the car's carbon fiber body in all its glory, as one would hope. The car's bespoke finish has fibers that flow in a very specific direction, continuing across neighboring panels to create an unbroken flow of carbon. However, the body isn't completely devoid of color—Mate tinted the car with red with bare carbon fiber accents. He even requested the bespoke badging feature red anodization.
Mate's Nevera has hand-painted Croatian flags on the side mirrors. It also has a hidden lightning motif under the rear spoiler that represents the sudden, turbulent Mediterranean thunderstorms that helped give the Nevera its name.
Mate selected asymmetrical trim inside—black on one side and red on the other. He filled the cabin with custom, hand-stitched motifs that are visible on the armrests, headrests, and knee pads. One is of Solinjanka, the girl from Solin, based on a sculpture in Zagreb's Archeological Museum.
""It’s kind of a crazy experience to be a customer of your own company,"" Mate says. ""And I probably wasn’t the easiest customer either. Just like with all our customers—there was a process of co-creation; sharing ideas, evolving them, and then finally perfecting them until you have a Nevera that stands alone and speaks to you personally. The result not only looks great but it tells an important story for me.""
Powering the Rimac are four bespoke permanent-magnet, oil-cooled electric motors—one for each wheel. The total output is 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 pound-feet of torque, which can propel the EV to 60 miles per hour in 1.75 seconds. The Nevera's top speed is 258 mph driving forward and 171.34 mph in reverse.

"GM's Novel Axial Flux Motor Could Be  Key to Smaller, Cheaper EVs",https://www.motor1.com/news/722078/gm-axial-flux-motor-patent/,"Using a unique hydraulic system, the automaker could boost the efficiency of an electric motor that is already lightweight and compact.",2024-12-25 08:52:38,"All BEVs today use radial-flux motors. In a radial-flux motor, a doughnut-shaped wound-copper stator sits around a central rotor often embedded with a series of permanent magnets. They are extremely efficient and well-suited to the task, but they have limitations. Axial flux motors could address many of their shortcomings, and General Motors has a plan to take some of the technology's design advantages even further.
The automaker has published dozens of patents related to the emerging motor topology, but one in particular caught our eye. It describes a system of mechanical field-weakening, which increases the speed of an electric motor at the cost of torque, just like a conventional transmission does.
It could mean smaller, lighter motors with a more useful powerband if it works. The biggest winners would be compact, inexpensive electric vehicles.
Field weakening is typically achieved through complex inverter controls. It creates the ""constant power"" region of an electric motor's output curve. If you didn't know, almost all permanent magnet motors have the same horsepower and torque curve, just at various magnitudes. This is presented in the chart above.
Mechanical field-weakening systems make it much easier to visualize how it works. Here's an example of a radial flux motor utilizing mechanical field weakening. This is an ""outrunner"" style radial flux motor where the rotor sits outside the stator. They're more popular in direct-drive applications.
As the stator is drawn further away from the rotor, the magnetism emanating from the stator gets weaker in relation to the rotor, which means less torque but also higher motor speeds. Just like shifting into second gear, it's a compromise to get the engine—electric in this case—into a different operating region that works better for a particular situation.
Why go mechanical if field-weakening software works with no moving parts? There are losses associated with doing it electronically. In Japan, for instance, people compete against each other in so-called ""Econo Power"" races, and many of the vehicles utilize mechanical field weakening to eke out high efficiency.
Mechanical field-weakening is conceptually simpler to achieve with an axial-flux motor, although there are still serious challenges. Axial flux motors are basically two disks opposed to each other with an air gap between them. When turned on, they spin, sure, but they also try to pull each other together. They're magnets, that's what they do. It'd be weird if they didn't.
The force trying to bring these two plates together at high torque ratings is extreme. This isn't usually a huge problem because you can use a fixed bearing to keep them apart. When you want to do mechanical field weakening, though, the rotor or stator has to move axially to adjust the air gap, but both must also stay totally rigid once they've found a new position.
GM plans to do this using a hydraulic system, which makes sense. It will use hydraulic fluid to narrow the gap when it wants more torque but less speed. It will widen the gap when it wants less torque but more speed.
If this sounds like a lot of cost, complexity, and trouble, consider how good automakers and suppliers have gotten at making something like an automatic transmission. This is much simpler than that, and the implications are impressive.
Smaller, less powerful EVs operating on lower-voltage architectures would be able to get plenty of torque off the line and then widen the air gap to achieve highway speeds. Smaller, lighter motors would be considerably more useful. This chart below from the patent explains it pretty well. The available torque is reduced, but the range at which it can be applied grows.
This system could theoretically operate like a CVT, continuously adjusting the air gap to tailor the motor's characteristics to a variety of situations.
All of this technology sure is interesting, but it likely won't be available for some time. Before we see anything like this, the next generation of mass-market EVs will likely feature more advanced battery technologies and minor enhancements to radial flux motors. Still, when someone like GM is hard at work on axial flux, you have to assume the company sees a future in it.",Peter Holderith
Nissan Has Stopped Spending Money On New Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/721845/nissan-stops-combustion-engine-investments/,It's going all-in on EVs.,2024-12-25 08:52:39,"Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru recently announced that they're joining forces to develop next-generation combustion engines. However, another Japanese automaker has taken a radically different approach by deciding to stop investing in gasoline and diesel power altogether. Nissan says it's pretty much done spending cash on new ICE technology.
Australian magazine Drive chatted with the company's Senior Vice-President and Chief Planning Officer for the Africa, Middle East, India, Europe, and Oceania (AMIEO) region about what lies ahead. Francois Bailly was asked whether Nissan intends to develop new combustion engines: ""Our future is EV. We're not investing in new powertrain for ICE, that's for sure.""
He mentioned that the transition from conventional powered cars to fully electric models will be done through Nissan's e-Power technology. It's an unconventional hybrid setup where the combustion engine acts as a generator to charge the battery. It doesn't drive the wheels, so it's similar to Mazda's rotary in the MX-30 crossover and the two-rotor setup in the Iconic SP concept.
To maximize fuel economy in these hybrid cars, Nissan wants to boost the thermal efficiency of a combustion engine to an impressive 50 percent. It's been working on the tech for several years, announcing in early 2021 that a prototype e-Power achieved the milestone during testing. It's worth noting that Toyota's Dynamic Force lineup of three-, four-, and six-cylinder engines has already surpassed 40 percent.
Just because Nissan is no longer pouring money into all-new engines, it doesn't mean the switch to an EV-only lineup will happen overnight. Bailley pointed out that emissions regulations continue to be relaxed in some parts of the world, such as in Africa where Euro 2 cars are still legal. The automaker will align its portfolio to regional requirements, so the ICE's demise will be gradual. Current engines are likely to be updated to meet stricter regulations.
Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru believe the internal combustion engine can be saved by making it run on nearly carbon-neutral fuels. The world's largest car manufacturer is working on three inline-fours while the Zoom-Zoom brand has set up a dedicated rotary team. As for Subie, it's preparing a new hybrid setup based around its signature boxer engine. Honda wants to go purely electric in all main markets (including North America) as early as 2040.

It's mostly thanks to that wing.,2024-12-25 08:52:40,"Viewed from the side, the all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S has a silhouette like most two-row luxury SUVs, with a strong resemblance to today’s Grand Cherokee in the greenhouse. Step to the rear, though, and it's a different story: Hidden behind sail-shaped D-pillars, the rear window has a much shallower angle and longer taper than the typical near-vertical tailgate. A giant wing sits atop the D-pillars, creating the illusion of a boxy, upright SUV. It’s a nifty trick that gives the Wagoneer S ultra-slippery aerodynamics while maintaining a more formal shape.
“To hit the aero target, we kept realizing that we had to create a very tapered profile,” Ralph Gilles, Stellantis Chief Design Officer, told Motor1. “We had to taper it to basically a tadpole shape, and none of us liked the look of it. So the wing became a solution to keep the profile attractive and get the benefits of the aero so it doesn't spoil the design.”
As Gilles explained, the typical SUV shape punches a hole in the air, creating a wake of turbulence that drags rearward as the vehicle moves forward. A teardrop or tadpole silhouette helps to close the hole, guiding the air back together and minimizing turbulence. If Jeep wanted the Wagoneer S to maximize its battery range, designers needed to find a way to make it aerodynamically slippery.
The pass-through wing was something of an accidental solution. “Initially it was literally just there to look cool and carry the [rear-view] camera,” Gilles told Motor1. “We ended up twisting it and turning it and finding that we can make it guide the air behind the vehicle, improving the aerodynamics.” The result: A drag coefficient of 0.294, on par with a first-generation Toyota Prius, making the Wagoneer S the slipperiest Jeep ever made.
“The really sloped roofline is absolutely one of the biggest enablers of how we got the 0.294 [Cd],” said Alison Rahm, Vice President of Product Development at Stellantis. “It was a lot of work there to get the roof down and then be able to manage the air as it comes off the roof, which the wing lets us do.”
Engineering the wing was no small feat. “What I tried to do for a long time was to put a center touchdown to the roof, because it hangs so far out, and there's so much mass in it,” Rahm said, noting with a laugh that Gilles was appalled by that idea. “And then you've got the vibration you have to worry about. The digital rearview mirror camera is in the wing. So I had to make sure, as people are staring at the mirror, that it's not oscillating. Finding the right way to get the stability without making it ugly, without adding all this unnecessary weight [...] that was probably one of our greatest challenges.”
Rahm and her team made it work, achieving their aerodynamic goal and enabling the first all-electric Jeep to achieve a battery range claim of more than 300 miles. “It is beautiful,” Rahm said of the cantilevered wing atop the new Jeep. “I stare at the car and I think, thank God, we made it work.”

Ford's Electric Pikes Peak Race Truck Makes Three Whole Tons of Downforce,https://www.motor1.com/news/721735/ford-lightning-supertruck-pikes-peak-downforce/,This is the most ridiculous pickup we've ever seen.,2024-12-25 08:52:42,"Ford is returning to Pikes Peak later next month with a wild electric pickup. The Blue Oval has been teasing the “EV demonstrator” since March, but today, the automaker gives us a complete look at the truck while revealing it can generate 6,000 pounds of downforce at 150 miles per hour.
The SuperTruck Demonstrator will achieve that figure with its equally wild aerodynamics. The low-slung pickup features a massive goose-neck wing that hangs off the back, towering above the roof of the cab. It also has a wide front splitter, outlets behind the front wheels, and a massive rear diffuser. Ford developed the truck in partnership with STARD.
Ford didn’t provide any further details about its electric SuperTruck beyond how much downforce it’ll make. However, it does have some styling similarities to the SuperVan 4.2 that the automaker campaigned in last year’s hillclimb event.
That, too, had a massive wing and an aggressive aero kit that kept it planted through the course’s 156 turns. Its triple-motor setup produced 1,400 horsepower. The new pickup could have a similar setup, but we’ll have to wait for more details. The Ford SuperVan 4.0 had four motors that made 1,972 hp.
This is Ford’s second electric demonstrator. It released the F-150 Switchgear, built in collaboration with RTR, earlier this year. The company based it on the production Lightning platform, enhancing its off-road capability with skid plats, composite body panels, and a new suspension.
Ford will likely continue teasing the pickup leading up to the event’s 102nd running that begins on June 23. We'll likely learn more details between now and when it runs up the hill. Romain Dumas, the current Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record holder, will pilot the Ford. But the Blue Oval won’t be the only automaker there with an EV. A modified Hyundai Ioniq 5 will also tackle the famous hillclimb course later in June.

"Fiat Reverses Course, Puts Gas Engine Back Into 500",https://www.motor1.com/news/721323/fiat-500-gas-engine-2026/,The latest 500 is purely electric but Fiat will install a combustion engine from 2026.,2024-12-25 08:52:43,"The rumors were true. Fiat has confirmed the latest 500 will get a combustion engine after all. Despite being launched strictly as an electric city car with no word of an ICE variant, the hatchback will get gasoline power. Parent company Stellantis has announced a hybrid 500 will be made at the Mirafiori factory in Italy beginning in 2026.
To be fair, the 500 technically never lost its combustion engine; Fiat still sells the previous-generation model outside the United States as a hybrid. In North America, the pint-sized car is strictly electric. It's too soon to say whether the ICE model will make its way to the US where it would definitely be cheaper than the pricey EV. The 2024 500e costs $34,095 before options.
It's obvious that the EV market's cooldown is forcing automakers to alter plans. Many assumed electric vehicles would replace ICE models sooner or later, but with EV incentives being gradually reduced and even eliminated in some cases, people are reconsidering their options.
With the new 500 getting a gas engine, it'll be interesting to see whether the high-performance Abarth 500e will also be joined by a hybrid model. As with the Fiat-badged, previous-generation model, Abarth still sells the sporty 500 with a conventional engine.
Several years ago, Fiat announced it would go purely electric by the end of the decade. However, it's unclear whether that's still happening. Other brands have also pushed back their EV-only ambitions beyond 2030, with the most recent example being Ford of Europe.
In related news, Stellantis also intends to build a hybrid version of the Jeep Compass at the Melfi plant in Italy. No further details were released but we're hoping it'll be based on the third-generation model. The current crossover has been around since 2016, so it's getting a bit long in the tooth.
Speaking of old cars sticking around, the Italian automaker isn't ruling out selling the Panda until 2029, at which point it will have been 18 years old. It would peacefully coexist with the next-gen model slated to debut on July 11 to mark 125 years of Fiat.

How Kia Quietly Designs Some of the Best-Looking Cars on the Road,https://www.motor1.com/features/720607/kia-design-interview/,"Kia's new head of design, Karim Habib, is turning the brand into a subtle stylistic powerhouse.",2024-12-25 08:52:45,"The Duomo di Milano cathedral in Italy took six centuries to erect. Six. Hundred. Years. Now it stands tall as the third-largest church on the planet and one of the prettiest buildings to grace God's green Earth. It better be for that much work.
Designing a car isn't the same as sculpting a religious landmark, but it's still a time-consuming process. Senior Vice President and Head of Kia Design, Karim Habib, knows that all too well. Habib has had a long career in car design. He spent years with BMW and Mercedes-Benz and had a small stint at Infiniti before heading Kia.
He's the man partly responsible for Kia's controversial new logo. Soon, his unique eye for design will have shaped every car that rolls off Kia's factory floor. You know his previous works like the Carnival, K5, and the facelifted Sorento. But Kia's embrace of electrification excites Habib the most from a design standpoint.
""To me, as a designer, the wonderful thing about EVs for design is you have to have big wheels because the cars are heavier,"" he tells me. ""You have to have a long wheelbase because you need as much battery as possible between the wheels. And you have short overhangs because you don’t have an engine in front of the front axle. So when you start with that, those are the basic ingredients that only premium manufacturers could afford in the past.""
Karim and I are sitting and chatting on a couch just a few miles from the heart of Milan, Italy near the Duomo. It's Design Week, an event that Kia—and Karim—deem hugely important for Kia design. With an event so focused on style, it’s the best way to get savvy shoppers in front of the newest product.
It's here where Kia offers us a closer look at the upcoming EV3—a tiny subcompact EV no bigger than the current Seltos. We saw the first EV3 concept in October, but this one is nearly production-ready; Kia says it's about as close as you can get to production while still being able to call it a prototype. The interior still isn't finished. Visually it looks similar to the updated EV6, and closer still to the newest EV9. Only tinier.
Best of all, the EV3 is coming to the US.
The EV3 offers a unique take on Kia’s ""Opposites United"" design language, which Karim helped pen nearly five years ago. While other automakers—like their corporate cousins at Hyundai—shy away from familial designs spanning multiple models, Karim believes that brand recognition is hugely important for Kia moving forward. He wants you to be able to point out his cars in a crowded parking lot and recognize them as Kias.
""Continuity is important. We’re a smaller brand than Hyundai, so it’s important for us to be recognized for a certain set of values and experiences they get when they come to Kia,"" he explains. ""So the product palette will change that perception, but we still want to have a common denominator that is the foundation. And obviously, the design is there to illustrate the values of the brand—you represent the brand as an object. So that’s why that consistency is important to us.""
The EV3 is the freshest take on Kia’s design language yet. Slim, upright LED lighting elements afford the SUV a clean, modern look while the boxy shape (becoming all too common in car design) arguably works even better on the smaller SUV than it does on, say, the three-row EV9.
The same can be said of the cabin. Clean, simple lines surround two 12.3-inch displays and a few hard buttons (like a volume dial, bless), flanked by eco-friendly materials like wool and faux leather. Kia has done away with leather in all of its EVs, in fact, and the company is looking into other eco-friendly materials. Mushroom leather, for example.
""Continuity is important... It’s important for us to be recognized for a certain set of values and experiences they get when they come to Kia.""
Karim uses terms like ""strictness"" and ""authenticity"" when describing the EV3. And while the pint-sized EV isn’t rugged at all, he does reference ionic off-roaders like Land Cruisers, Land Rovers, and Jeeps as inspiration. The idea, Karim says, is to make sure Kia’s EV designs remain as relevant as those historic SUVs still do today.
SUVs are a huge focus for Kia, obviously. The company sells a ton of them. The EV6 was the first toe dipped into electrification, and the EV9—even in its infancy—is proving to be a huge success. Soon the EV3 will stand alone as one of the only affordable electric SUVs in America as Kia aims for a starting price of around $30,000.
But Kia still cares about performance.
Remember the EV4 sedan concept from October? That too is heading to production (potentially alongside the EV3) and Karim wants to keep the brand’s ""Opposites United"" design language consistent there, too. But with more of an emphasis on performance.
""With the EV4 concept, we also have [those design elements]. When you have horizontal headlamps at the corner, it automatically makes the car feel wider,"" he explains. ""So having these vertical headlamps is a bit of a challenge, we weren’t sure if it would make the car feel narrower or higher. But we managed to place them pretty low so that you still get a nice dynamic quality to it. It has some challenges that come with it, but I think we can find ways to make it work.""
The Kia EV4 could become the next Stinger—or a slightly smaller sports sedan akin to the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3 Performance. Either way, it will bear a version of Kia’s edgy design language found on the EV3 and EV9. Though, it certainly won’t be a cut-and-paste job, either.
""The [design] principle, I hope, is based on the same idea, but the execution should be different,"" says Karim.
As with anything, good design takes time. Karim and Kia both believe that. And amidst a design renaissance that could propel the company into the next decade and hopefully well beyond, Kia has no plans of rushing its future.

Volkswagen And Renault Won't Build An Affordable EV Together,https://www.motor1.com/news/720684/renault-volkswagen-failed-ev-collaboration/,"The Twingo is still happening, just not with VW's help.",2024-12-25 08:52:47,"Facing an influx of cheap electric cars from China, European automakers have legitimate reasons to worry. Renault wanted to create an alliance with Volkswagen to better compete with imports but to no avail. A jointly developed EV with a low starting price is not happening. Speaking with Reuters, Renault CEO Luca de Meo said the talks between the two parties have ended.
The French company's head honcho calls it a ""lost opportunity,"" but he suggests that Renault is still open to collaborating with other car manufacturers: ""There may be others."" VW refused to comment, but the two major automakers have officially parted ways. Meanwhile, Renault is riding solo and still aims to have the next-gen Twingo on sale in 2026.
It's worth noting the old Twingo is still around, both with combustion engines and as an EV. The all-new city car will come exclusively in zero-emission guise and undercut the Renault 5, which is kicking off from about €25,000 ($27,000) before incentives. The new Twingo is projected to cost less than €20,000 ($21,600).
It's unclear what VW plans now that it's no longer negotiating with Renault. The Wolfsburg company could use an entry-level EV that would undercut the ID.3 and act as a replacement for the e-up! Something along the lines of an ID.1. VW technical development boss Kai Grunitz has already suggested it would be priced at under €20,000 ($21,600). He projected it would go on sale around 2027.
The battle in the entry-level EV segment is heating up, not just because of Chinese cars flooding Europe. The Dacia Spring is a roaring success, albeit that one too is technically a Chinese car. A better example is the Citroën e-C3, which costs €23,300 and is getting a base version with a lower driving range for €19,990.
In the United States, automakers largely focus on crossovers for their EV ambitions. There's the Fiat 500e and Nissan Leaf on the affordable non-SUV side, with a new Chevrolet Bolt coming next year. The new electric Mini 3-Door could also come to America as well later this decade, but only after production starts in Oxford in 2026.

The Jeep Avenger 4xe Gets Four-Wheel Drive and Lifted Suspension,https://www.motor1.com/news/720543/jeep-avenger-4xe-debut-specs/,The Jeep you can't have in the US finally has what all Jeeps should: Four-wheel drive.,2024-12-25 08:52:47,"It's strange to talk about a Jeep model not sold in the United States. The Avenger, a small Euro-only crossover revealed in 2022, is built at the Tychy plant in Poland alongside its sister models, the Alfa Romeo Junior and Fiat 600. It’s only been offered with front-wheel drive, but now, a new 4xe hybrid trim adds what all Jeeps should have: four-wheel drive.
At the heart of the Avenger 4xe is a tiny 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with mild-hybrid technology. It's a three-cylinder turbo mill that develops 136 horsepower and routes output to the wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Joining the ICE are two electric motors, one at the front and the other at the rear, with each developing 28 hp.
Jeep claims the new hybrid setup enables a sprint to 62 mph in nine and a half seconds and a top speed of 121 mph. At speeds of up to 19 mph, the Avenger 4xe always works in 4x4 mode with a 50:50 split between the two axles. From 19 to 56 mph, it defaults to front-wheel drive, but the rear motor is always ready to intervene should the need arise since. Go faster than 56 mph and the rear motor is disengaged to reduce fuel consumption.
The 4xe brings other benefits. The hybrid trim also gets a multi-link rear suspension and jacks up the ride height for an extra 0.4 inches of ground clearance, now at 8.26 inches. The 22-degree approach, 35-degree departure, and 21-degree breakover angles are better than those of a regular Avenger with front-wheel drive.
Jeep says the more capable variant can ford water up to about 15.75 inches deep. To sweeten the pot, there are Snow, Sand & Mud, Sport, and Auto driving modes to choose from. On top of that, customers can spend extra on the optional all-terrain tires better suited for tackling rough terrain.
Jeep has toughened up the Avenger's appearance by giving the 4xe rugged bumpers with a scratch-resistant finish. Roof rails come as standard, as does a rear tow hitch. Inside, the seats are upholstered in a waterproof material claimed to be twice as durable as before. The seats also have a special coating making it easier to remove stains and mud.
The not-for-America Jeep Avenger 4xe goes on sale in Europe late this year. It joins the already available mild-hybrid and purely electric derivatives that are both offered strictly with a front-wheel-drive setup.

Another Rumor Says Hyundai's Hydrogen Supercar Debuts in 2026 With 765 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/720509/hyundai-hydrogen-supercar-2026-launch/,It'll try to claim the Nurburgring record for production cars.,2024-12-25 08:52:49,"Ok, here we go again. The N Vision 74 refuses to die. Multiple reports suggest Hyundai plans to put its modern take on the DeLorean into production, and the gossip keeps piling up. South Korean business newspaper The Korea Economic Daily says the hydrogen supercar is happening. For real this time. It's supposedly coming out in 2026, four years after the concept car debuted.
The Hyundai flagship sports car is apparently known internally as the ""N74"" and is being developed with a rear-wheel-drive layout. The street-legal model is said to be a two-door coupe with gullwing doors and design cues from the 1974 Pony Coupe—the brand's very first car.
While the concept had to make do with ""just"" 671 horsepower, the subsequent production model will allegedly pack at least 765 horsepower. The Korea Economic Daily—which is the country's largest business newspaper by revenue, per Wikipedia—claims the N74 will be able to hit 62 mph in three seconds flat.
The N74 will reportedly go after the Nurburgring record for production cars, which won't be easy considering the Mercedes-AMG One did a lap of the Green Hell in only 6 minutes and 35.183 seconds. The report goes on to mention that Hyundai's dedicated supercar will do two laps of the Nordschleife at full tilt before running out of juice.
Hyundai will reportedly limit production to only 200 units and build these cars from 2026 until 2028. Prototype testing is apparently slated to start as early as this August. The N74 is said to cost an estimated 500 million won, which works out to about $366,000 at current exchange rates.
The idea behind the car is not necessarily to make a profit but to prove hydrogen can be an exciting technology. It remains to be seen how many people will be willing to fork out this kind of money for a Hyundai. With the Ioniq 5 N, the company has already proven battery-powered EVs can be exciting. Provided the report is accurate, the firm now wants to replicate that with a hydrogen fuel cell performance vehicle.
As always, we take the information with the proverbial pinch of salt. An N74 would be an interesting alternative to the current crop of ICE, plug-in hybrid, and EV supercars. Not just because of its unusual powertrain but also thanks to its excellent design.

Alpine Wants To Sell A Hydrogen V-6 Road Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/720348/alpine-v6-road-car-considered/,It would have over 340 horsepower.,2024-12-25 08:52:51,"With Alpine coming to the United States in 2026, we're keeping a close eye on what Renault's performance division is planning. Like so many other brands, the French marque is investing in fully electric vehicles, but the combustion engine could still play a role. The ICE could be saved by making it run on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels.
Alpine's design boss Antony Villain told Autocar the Alpenglow isn't just for show since it was developed with a production car in mind. While the concept features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a bigger V-6 is already in development. It's going to have more than the 340 horsepower offered by the four-pot. The larger internal combustion engine might find its way into a street-legal model that would be sold in a limited series.
When asked whether the Alpenglow has a shot of making it to production, Villain replied: ""Why not? Why not have that on the roads? We want to keep both ways [hydrogen ICE and EV] possible. Maybe we could do a little series of these cars for the road. That could be just right."" Alpenglow is an evolution of a namesake concept from 2022 and Renault's go-faster division is already planning a third variant that'll look closer to a production vehicle.
The sports car's current iteration is off to a rocky start since it failed to take part during its maiden test in Belgium at the Spa-Francorchamps track. It wasn't the combustion engine's fault, but rather an electrical issue. As it stands, Alpenglow uses an LMP3 chassis from Ligier, replacing the original concept’s bespoke chassis. The smaller engine will be swapped out later this year for the new V-6.
Speaking during the Annual General Meeting last week, Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo hinted at putting the Alpenglow into production. He said the A110 is not going to be on sale for much longer but the lineup will be renewed and expanded to seven models. The portfolio will be ""100-percent electric and maybe, potentially, hydrogen-engine cars.""
In the meantime, it’s sadly too late for the mid-engine A110 to come to the United States. Its electric replacement is due here in 2026 as a coupe and roadster, with an SUV arriving in 2027 and a four-door A310 swoopy sedan to follow a year later.

Lamborghini Uncertain Electric Supercars Will Ever Catch On,https://www.motor1.com/news/720360/lamborghini-uncertain-electric-supercars-popular/,Winkelmann sees an opportunity with combustion engines running on e-fuels.,2024-12-25 08:52:52,"Lamborghini’s first EV won't arrive until 2028—and it's not going to be a supercar. Instead, Lanzador will take the shape of a lifted 2+2 grand tourer with four seats. Something like a Huracan or Revuelto EV isn't on the agenda. Why? There's just no business case. The company's CEO believes electric supercars are selling poorly.
Speaking with Automotive News Europe, Lamborghini's head honcho Stephan Winkelmann argued electric supercars are ""not something that is selling so far."" He went on to mention this genre might never catch on: ""It's too early, and we have to see down the road if and when this is going to happen.""
It makes sense that Lamborghini still uses a V-12 in the Aventador's replacement while the Huracan successor will have gas power as well. However, the smaller of the two supercars is losing its naturally aspirated V-10 in favor of a newly developed twin-turbo V-8.
Supercars are for rich folk but Rimac CEO Mate Rimac recently admitted that high-end buyers don't want electric supercars. It's why the Nevera is still for sale, despite the hype around it and the limited production run of only 150 cars. The electric hypercar developed in Croatia set no fewer than 23 records last year, but it looks as though wealthy people weren't impressed enough to sign their names on the dotted line.
Bugatti is also keeping the internal combustion engine alive with its upcoming Chiron replacement. The Molsheim-based brand isn't even cutting the cylinder count. The new ""French"" beast will have a naturally aspirated V-16 engine as part of a hybrid setup.
Another elite brand currently staying away from full EVs is Pagani, despite working on the technology since 2018. It hasn't abandoned the R&D efforts but a production model is not coming anytime soon. Why? Batteries are still too heavy and that dilutes the driving experience.
However, not all supercar brands think this way. Ferrari is still on track to introduce a performance EV. It’s actually ahead of schedule with development, before launching the car in late 2025. Meanwhile, it's opening a new factory in Maranello next month. The site will build the company's electric models.
Stricter emissions regulations are forcing automakers to transition to EVs but supercar makers are sticking with gas engines for as long as possible. Why? Because they know what their customers want, which is the emotion only a large-displacement ICE can deliver. EVs are significantly quicker but Stephan Winkelmann reckons it's not as thrilling as a high-revving gas engine mounted behind the seats.
Ideally, the Lamborghini supremo wants to save combustion engines by switching to e-fuels. The Italian exotic brand could leverage the advancements made by the Volkswagen Group brand Porsche in developing and producing nearly carbon-neutral synthetic fuels in Chile.

Honda Modified A Peterbilt To Run On Hydrogen Fuel Cells,https://www.motor1.com/news/719966/honda-modified-peterbilt-hydrogen-fuel-cells/,It uses three fuel cell systems generating a total output of 240 kilowatts and can go 400 miles with a full load.,2024-12-25 08:52:54,"Honda is known for its small vehicles. But there's nothing small about the company's latest concept. It's a semi-truck infused with hydrogen fuel cells, simply dubbed the Class 8 Hydrogen Fuel Cell Truck Concept. Honda will showcase it, along with other fuel-cell vehicles, at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Las Vegas on May 20.
The truck is a fully functional demonstrator designed to showcase Honda's current hydrogen tech. It carries three fuel-cell systems, each capable of generating 80 kilowatts. That's 240 kW of combined energy, powering an unknown number of electric motors. Honda says the truck has an estimated top speed of 70 mph, and can travel 400 miles before refueling. It's worth noting the range applies to a fully loaded truck/trailer combo weighing 82,000 pounds.
While the truck is a concept, the fuel cells aren't. They're new mass-production items currently being built at the joint Honda-General Motors plant in Michigan. With this truck, Honda hopes to grab the interests of potential partners to help pursue a hydrogen-fueled future.
“Commercial vehicles, including Class 8 trucks, where fuel cells offer the best zero-emission replacement for existing diesel applications, are a key part of Honda’s broad hydrogen business strategy,” said Ryan Harty, Honda assistant vice president of sustainability and business development. “Honda is actively seeking business collaborations and customers to help bring these hydrogen fuel cell solutions to market here in North America.”
Honda takes ownership of the concept with its fuel cell internals, but the truck is actually a Peterbilt. To our eye, it looks like a 579EV—a battery electric rig with a pair of e-axles and a range of 150 miles. Honda makes no mention of Peterbilt in its announcement, and images show Peterbilt badges removed from the concept. It's unclear if there's any co-development happening between the two brands; we contacted Honda for clarification, and we'll provide an update if more information becomes available.

The 2025 Kia Sorento Plug-In Hybrid Is Cheaper Than Last Year's Model,https://www.motor1.com/news/719672/2025-kia-sorento-plug-in-hybrid-price/,"The base price is now $49,365 thanks to a new entry-level trim. Step up to the SX Prestige model and you'll be paying $54,465.",2024-12-25 08:52:55,"Kia announced pricing and information for 2025 Sorento Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid on Tuesday, both of which get the refresh we've already seen for the pure combustion 2024 model. As you might expect, prices are higher versus last year—significantly higher in some cases. But there's a surprise in the mix. The new Sorento plug-in hybrid's base price is actually lower than before.
That's because buyers now have a new entry-level trim to choose from. EX is now the entry point for the plug-in hybrid, with a base price of $49,365, including a $1,375 destination charge. That's $2,300 less than last year's base MSRP, and you still get the same hybrid powertrain making 261 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. As a refresher, it's a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with a single electric motor and a 14-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The 2025 Sorento's electric-only range is 30 miles.
The EX trim also gets luxuries like heated power front seats, a 12.3-inch center display, 19-inch aluminum wheels, LED headlights, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and gobs of USB power ports throughout the three-row interior. Over-the-air updates are standard, as are a modest selection of driver-assist features like lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot warning, and forward collision avoidance, and more. And it's all wrapped in the facelifted exterior that Kia revealed last year.
Stepping up to the SX Prestige trim costs $54,465—$2,800 more than last year. This is where you'll find stuff like leather trim, heated and ventilated seats, a Bose stereo system, dual 12.3-inch screens for the driver and the center infotainment system, and more. It's also the only way to get Kia's full suite of driver assists like blind-spot collision avoidance, advanced frontal collision avoidance, rear collision avoidance, and a surround-view camera.
Kia also announced pricing and details for the mild-hybrid Sorento. You'll pay $40,065 for the entry-level EX with front-wheel drive; going for all-wheel drive bumps the sticker to $41,865. These are modest increases of $1,700 and $1,200 versus last year. The Sorento Hybrid SX Prestige, meanwhile, takes a $4,400 leap to start at $48,265. The 227-horsepower hybrid powertrain carries over from 2024; it's a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with a single motor powered by a 1.5 kilowatt-hour battery.

"Jaguar's New Electric GT Will Start At Over $125,000",https://www.motor1.com/news/719485/jaguar-electric-gt-starting-price/,A concept previewing the new model debuts in the US later this year.,2024-12-25 08:53:06,"Last year Jaguar Land Rover announced an expensive rebranding. The company shortened its corporate name to JLR, turned its Land Rover models into individual brands, and teased Jaguar's electrified future. The company's $18.6-billion investment will include an effort to take Jaguar upmarket, which will put the price of its first electric vehicle at over £100,000 ($125,000 at today's exchange rate).
We'll get our first look at what $125k will get you later this year when Jaguar reveals a concept that previews the new GT. The British carmaker will launch the car at an event somewhere in the United States, a market it says is vital to the company's success. The hope is to put Jaguar in competition with brands like Bentley and Porsche.
Jaguar's three new electric vehicles will ride on the Jaguar Electrified Platform. JLR CEO Adrian Mardell said the architecture, which is special to the brand, would allow Jaguer to feel unique once again, according to Automotive News Europe.
This isn't the first time the company has sought premium buyers, as Mardell noted that Jaguar had previously been successful at such an effort in the 1990s.
Personally, we're hoping for an XJ220 revival. Jaguar Chief Creative Officer Gerry McGovern said during last week's company investors call that limited-run special editions will be vital to the brand's relaunch and pricing strategy. The new, four-door GT will be an all-new model for the brand that’ll take inspiration from past vehicles like the iconic E-Type. It goes on sale sometime in 2025.

The First Hybrid Porsche 911 Debuts on May 28,https://www.motor1.com/news/719326/porsche-911-hybrid-debut-may-28/,"It's 8.7 seconds quicker on the Nurburgring than its predecessor, the Carrera S",2024-12-25 08:53:08,"A completely new era for the Porsche 911 will begin on May 28. Porsche plans to reveal the first road-going 911 hybrid, pushing the iconic sports car into the modern era.
We've seen the 911 hybrid in prototype form for over two years now. Porsche tells us that development is now complete, amassing 3.1 million miles in the process. Some of that mileage comes from the Nürburgring, where Porsche shares a rather tantalizing clue as to what badge the electrified 911 will wear. We're told the hybrid laps the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 16.9 seconds, 8.7 seconds faster than ""the corresponding version of the predecessor model.""
Basic math brings us to 7:25.6, and a quick look through recent Porsche 911 Nurburgring lap times brings us to the 992-generation Carrera S, which turned a 7:25 lap back in 2020. Images shared from Porsche don't reveal badges, but the lack of bonkers bodywork points to something on the milder side. A Carrera S with a hybrid powertrain certainly fits that bill.
“For the first time in our icon’s 61-year history, we are installing a hybrid drive system in a roadgoing 911,"" said Frank Moser, Porsche vice president for the 911 and 718. ""This innovative performance hybrid makes the 911 even more dynamic. We left nothing to chance during development and tested the new 911 under all sorts of conditions all over the world from the freezing cold to scorching heat, as was the case during the final stages of testing in Dubai.""
Details of the hybrid powertrain are as yet unknown. Porsche tells us it's aimed at performance, not efficiency, and we were previously told it won't be a plug-in hybrid. With a 'Ring time of 7:16, is should be plenty fast without losing its capability to carve corners.
All will be revealed on May 28. Be sure to check back in 18 days time, we'll have everything you need to know.

The BMW 7 Series Plug-In Hybrid Can't Beat The EV,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/719302/bmw-7-series-plug-in-hybrid-review/,"BMW's newest 7 Series is a fantastic car, but the plug-in hybrid drivetrain isn’t up to snuff.",2024-12-25 08:53:10,"I pay attention to how others perceive the car I’m in, whether it’s my own bargain-basement poverty-spec Camry, or a supercar. So I can assure you that the BMW 7 Series stands alone as the most fearsome vehicle I’ve ever tested. Finished in ""Frozen Pure Gray"" with all-black M accents, this car—a plug-in hybrid 750e xDrive—is downright evil. Cyclists yield. Pedestrians shuffle through crosswalks faster. Minivans leave the fast lane.

The 7 Series' dramatic proportions are unmatched by its contemporaries. With present-day upper crusters obsessed with projecting their ethical consumerism, a sedan that looks like Cruella De Ville’s daily driver stands alone. Whether you find it attractive or not, the 750e means business, and for that, I love it.
It looks a bit less like a supervillain’s lair inside, but remains just as luxurious as one. My demo car ($135,345 as-tested) had nicer carpets than I have in my apartment, and the wine-colored, full-grain Merino leather appointments are Rolls-quality. (If Merino leather is too poverty-spec, don’t worry, cashmere upholstery is also an option.)
The 18-way adjustable front power seats are some of the most comfortable I’ve ever experienced, and the fit and finish in the cabin is some of the best I’ve ever seen. One-touch automatic doors slam themselves shut with a satisfying “thunk”. The optional 1,965-watt Bowers & Wilkins speaker system ($4,800) has beautifully crafted grilles integrated into the door cards, and audio quality is sublime. The LED-woven glass roof ($950) is stunning at night and perfectly tinted during the day. The armrests are heated. No detail was lazily developed; Even the seats get a set of opulent crystal levers on the LED-backlit door panel strip for adjustment, with fine movements controlled via the center touchscreen.
That 14.3-inch touchscreen is also where you access the 7 Series Executive Package’s ($4,600) seat massage functionality… as well as basically every other piece of functionality in the car. The driver gets a heavily customizable 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that seamlessly blends into the infotainment system; Both of these screens are housed in the same curved glass panel that spans two-thirds of the dash. BMW’s iDrive infotainment software runs on the “floating” display, and it’s beautiful, responsive, and fairly easy to navigate, although some of the menus are hidden.
There are some minor frustrations stemming from the UI’s singular focus on the touchscreen—both driver and passenger cannot adjust their seat heaters at the same time, as only one set of controls can be used at once, for example. For a cabin almost wholly devoid of buttons, the 7 Series’ overall user experience is still excellent.
Less satisfying is the driver’s heads-up display, which takes up enough windshield real estate to become distracting. The HUD—combined with the odd half-click, half-scroll wheels on either side of the steering wheel—were confusing and difficult to use on the fly. I often changed radio stations accidentally, and had to shift my focus to the HUD to fix whatever I’d just bumped.
These quibbles pale in comparison to actually driving the 750e, which stands alone in the 7-Series lineup… as by far the most frustrating of any drivetrain on offer.
Like the mild-hybrid and fully electric 7 Series variants, the 750e has lithe, if numb, handling for its 126.6-inch wheelbase, thanks to well-tuned four-wheel steering. The problem with this PHEV is the integration of its 194-horsepower single electric motor and 308-hp turbocharged straight-six drivetrains.
Apply mild pressure to the brake pedal and regenerative braking is smooth, but weak. Then the car lurches, decelerating much harder, once the pedal is pressed hard enough to engage the calipers. The 750e’s pedal travel inconsistencies make smoothly stopping very difficult. What’s worse, the amount of brake pressure it takes to engage the calipers is variable based on speed, so I never quite knew what the pedal would feel like at any given stoplight.
BMW’s insistence of always-on “adaptive braking”—where the 750e slows itself down for stop signs or traffic ahead—drove me completely insane. It was always different behavior from the brakes every single day. The only way to shut off this one-and-a-half pedal driving was to engage Sport Mode, which brought me to my next major frustration: the throttle pedal.
At low speeds in normal modes, the EV drivetrain is quick and responsive, but lean into the pedal harder and it becomes difficult to modulate. The throttle feels as though it has two-thirds the travel it should, and attempting to smoothly roll on the gas for a quick getaway often results in pushing past the electric-only drivetrain and into a surge of gas-powered fury. Switching to Sport Mode (to get better brake behavior) made the entire driveline twitchier. When wrung out in anger, the 750e moves in a hurry (4.6 seconds to 60) thanks to its hybrid system’s 493 hp. But driving the 7 Series in constant anger feels like defeating its entire purpose.
The least frustrating way to drive the 750e was to get to the freeway, turn on the Level 2 Highway Driving Assistant ($2,000), and let the Bimmer do the heavy lifting. Still, I would have preferred more of me driving the Ultimate Driving Machine.
The EPA rates the 14.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack for 34 miles of all-electric range, which is middling in the class—the Mercedes S-Class PHEV achieves 56 miles of EV-only driving. The EPA estimates the 750e can achieve 65 MPGe (and 25 MPG) overall; I ran the 7-Series’s battery to zero and still achieved more than 30 MPG total, which is great for the 5,635-pound 750e.
The efficiency still isn’t worth the frustration. Luckily, if you want to skip all of the annoyance of the 750e but still enjoy the 7 Series’ incredible cabin and styling, you can. The superb, all-electric i7 is on offer for $1,000 less, with all of the same strengths and a much more solid drivetrain. Skip the plug-in, and move straight to the EV.

Two Hyundai Ioniq 5 Ns Overtake Dozens Of Cars At Nürburgring,https://www.motor1.com/news/719388/hyundai-ioniq-5-nurburgring-laps/,The hot EVs perform intense back-to-back laps of the Nordschleife.,2024-12-25 08:53:11,"Whoever thought the day would come when we'd be talking about an exciting Hyundai electric crossover? The Ioniq 5 N is just that, and these hot laps of the Nurburgring show it’s a real track weapon despite its heft. It may weigh close to 4,900 pounds but the hot EV is properly fast, provided it’s in the hands of a skilled driver, as is the case here.
Nordschleife ""resident"" Misha Charoudin took the high-performance electric crossover for a full lap of the challenging track, overtaking dozens of cars in the process. The intense onboard footage shows the YouTuber chasing another Ioniq 5 N. The two cars did back-to-back laps, switching positions during the second run.
The 84.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack was fully charged before hitting the track. Despite being pushed hard, the Ioniq 5 N still had 42 percent of juice left at the end of the second lap. As a refresher, the Nürburgring is one of the longest circuits in the world, at nearly 13 miles long. The two runs weren't timed but Sport Auto's test driver Christian Gebhardt did a 7:45 lap a few months ago. That made it only 2.6 seconds slower than a BMW M2 CS.
To be fair, not all drivers on the track were as experienced as Misha. Knowing a circuit like that gives you the confidence to push the car further. However, even if we were as experienced as him, we'd be reluctant to punish the Ioniq 5 N while the owner sits on the passenger seat.
The exciting track footage goes to show the era of truly exciting EVs is upon us. We could honestly do without the fake engine noise and gear changes, though. The recipe should be further improved if Hyundai decides to come out with a smaller and lighter vehicle. A dedicated sports car with the dual-motor setup and all the other N trickery would be wonderful.
In the meantime, the Korean brand is gearing up to launch an Ioniq 6 N sedan that could have even more power. You know, because 641 hp is apparently not enough.

This Alpine Sports Car Has a Hydrogen Combustion Turbo Engine,https://www.motor1.com/news/719186/alpine-alpenglow-hy4-details/,It's only a four-pot but a bigger V-6 is coming.,2024-12-25 08:53:12,"Some automakers are adamant that the combustion engine is worth saving. Toyota believes it can be done by making the ICE burn hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. Porsche and Lamborghini think synthetic fuels might be the answer. Renault's performance brand Alpine is on team hydrogen, and this Alpenglow Hy4 is a proof of concept.
An evolution of the static 2022 Alpenglow concept, the Hy4 is a running prototype. It rocks a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine developing 340 horsepower. The four-cylinder mill revs to 7,000 rpm and feeds off from three hydrogen tanks, each carrying 4.6 pounds of hydrogen at 700 bar of pressure. Output is channeled to the road via a sequential transmission.
If you finding the four-pot underwhelming, Alpine is working on a bigger engine. An all-new V-6 developed entirely in-house specifically for hydrogen applications is coming. A subsequent variant of the Alpenglow, possibly called the Hy6, will premiere in late 2024. In the meantime, the Hy4 is about to hit the track.
It'll make its public debut tomorrow during the six-hour endurance race at Spa-Francorchamps as part of the FIA WEC 2024 season. It will then head to France to attend the 24 Hours of Le Mans scheduled for June 14-15.
The Hy4 is not a spitting image of the original Alpenglow concept since Alpine tweaked the body. It has a modified crash structure to accommodate a two-seat cabin while the hydrogen tanks are embedded into the side pods. It's also a bit taller than before and has a reworked aero package, accentuated by the new roof scoop.
While the Hy4 is a track-only machine, Alpine believes the powertrain technology makes sense in a street-legal model as well. The French niche marque goes as far as to say a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine represents a ""tremendously promising solution for road use.""
The idea of modifying a combustion engine to run on hydrogen is much older than Toyota's experiments with the GR Yaris and GR Corolla. BMW had a V-12 7 Series with a 6.0-liter unit running on hydrogen in 2005. Going even further back in time, the German luxury brand developed a 5 Series (E12) to run on liquid hydrogen in the late 1970s. It's the 520h featured below in a BMW Group Classic video.

The Hummer EV SUV Is Not for the Rational,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/718986/hummer-ev-suv-in-moab/,"The Hummer EV can do a lot off-road for a 9,000-ish pound truck, but its strengths lie beyond ability or rationality.",2024-12-25 08:53:14,"It is absurd that GMC only offers one shocking color for the Hummer EV: Afterburner Tintcoat, an eye-searing tangerine. Ordering GMC’s self-proclaimed “supertruck” in rental-car silver would be akin to whitewashing Saint Basil’s Cathedral. This design is at its best when screaming for attention. Obviously, when faced with a lineup of Hummers to test, I asked for the bright orange one, cranked up some ‘80s rock, and made sure all eyes would be on me.
It’s a good thing I started there, because grabbing attention turned out to be the Hummer’s greatest strength—on pavement, at least. GMC tossed me the keys in Grand Junction, Colorado, and told me to get to Moab, Utah an hour and a half away.
As you might expect of a bright orange T-topped SUV, it's not oozing practicality. The Hummer was “please speak up” noisy at highway speed, courtesy of enormous all-terrain tires and a flat windshield. Steering feel is numb and heavy, and especially vague on-center. The steering wheel is barely adjustable, the synthetic leather seats are neither easy to wipe down nor luxurious, and the interior simultaneously comes off as gaudy and cheap. It doesn’t feel like a six-figure truck.
From an engineering standpoint, it’s no standout, either. Despite an estimated 170 kilowatt-hours capacity battery pack—GMC hasn’t released exact kWh stats—the tri-motor 3X trim with the Extreme Off-Road Package is rated by the EPA at just 298 miles of range and 53 combined MPGe. Back-of-the-envelope math works out to 1.76 miles/kWh. The Hummer EV is one of the least-efficient electric vehicles on the road. It doesn’t even get to claim top dog in output as a tradeoff either, as its combined 830 horsepower is bested by the Rivian R1S Quad-Motor’s 835 HP. The Hummer's 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds is handily defeated by the Cybertruck Beast’s 2.6-second dash to 60 too.
Be assured that 3.5 seconds is still plenty fast in a truck this size. On hard merges, the front end thrusts skyward with such ferocity it feels like the SUV could take off with enough runway. Luckily, you won’t be flying skyward, as the Hummer weighs somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 pounds, a number that vividly comes to life when you jam the brakes at highway speeds. This mass got exhausting to manhandle on the way to Moab, but luckily GM’s superb Super Cruise level 2 automation comes standard.
Let us abandon rational auto-reviewer thought for a moment, though. Highway comfort and bragging rights be damned. In bright orange with the T-tops off, every living being in the city of Moab down to the kangaroo rats stared at me as I drove past. If you want attention—and Lord knows I do—it’s impossible to beat the Hummer, even with a Cybertruck.
And what better way to show off your Hummer—and yourself—than to tackle a trail that would leave lesser trucks, and men, broken and battered? This is where the Hummer can surpass its competition on paper. The Hummer EV has eye-watering off-road stats: 15.9 inches of maximum ground clearance, a 35.4-foot turning circle (aided by four-wheel steering), and a staggering 49.6-degree approach angle. This puts it far ahead of the Rivian R1S and Tesla Cybertruck, and the Hummer SUV boasts better breakover and departure than the nine-inch-longer-wheelbase Hummer EV Pickup. (The SUV even bests the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler 4xe in rock-crawling metrics.) Its off-road abilities in the electrified world stand alone.
Reality backs up those impressive numbers. Our test trail was a blue “More Difficult” 4x4 path that looped through the desert south of Moab. It’s a trail you could tackle in a Jeep on 35s, but that you’d still want heaps of body protection for, as it includes sharp rocks and staircase descents.
Putting the Hummer into Terrain Mode—which heavily dampens throttle response to allow for easier power modulation—allowed me to (mostly) gently coax the four-and-a-half-ton behemoth down stairs without riding the Extreme All Terrain Package’s rock sliders all the way. One-pedal driving was brilliant and used a combination of physical brakes and regenerative braking that was smooth all the way to zero, a rarity for any EV. Its underbody shielding could make an armadillo jealous; There isn’t a weak point underneath this truck, which gave me extra confidence when sliding down big steps.
Terrain mode also dials up the front/rear steering ratio to 1:1.2—for every one turn of the front wheels, the rears move 1.2 (up to their full ten degrees of angle). It feels absurd at first, but it’s an absolute necessity for the Hummer EV. Although its wheelbase is much shorter than its pickup sibling, it’s still 126.7 inches long—almost half a foot longer than a Chevrolet Tahoe. Once I got the hang of the rear end’s steering, it made the massive Hummer almost corner like a mid-size. If desired, the 3X can also enter parallel-steering mode (known as “crab walking” in Hummer parlance), but I only engaged it as a party trick—I struggle to envision an off-road scenario where it would be useful.
While the Hummer performed exceptionally in Moab for an almost 9,000-pound truck, I never forgot how massive it was. On the few sections of trail that weren’t slickrock, I watched the first and sixth trucks in our group deal with vastly different conditions, as the massive weight of the Hummer was too much for soft dirt, which fell away from the trail with every subsequent truck. I pinstriped the Afterburner Tintcoat on every patch of sagebrush in southern Utah, because at 86.7 inches—almost half a foot wider than a Hummer H2—it was simply too wide to fit most trails. My line choices were constrained to wherever I could physically fit the truck, which forced me into trickier maneuvers than I might need in a reasonably sized vehicle.
Despite this, its off-road abilities are currently unmatched in its competitive set, although the minute electrified Mercedes G-Wagen hits the market, that title will become much harder to defend. Even if it gets surpassed by the Benz: who cares? I maintain that attempting to rationally analyze the Hummer defeats its entire purpose. Get it in orange. Pop off the T-tops. Crank up Mötley Crüe. The Hummer is here to party, and it’ll get to the party whether it’s in Miami or Moab.

Rimac CEO Says High-End Buyers Don’t Want Electric Hypercars Anymore,https://www.motor1.com/news/718973/rimac-buyers-dont-want-electric-hypercars/,"Future Rimacs might have some form of combustion power, if that's what the market demands.",2024-12-25 08:53:15,"The desire for electric hypercars is already dwindling. Rimac CEO Mate Rimac said this week that buyers at the high end of the market want to differentiate themselves as EVs go mainstream. They want combustion engines and an analog feel, not what the masses buy.
Mate noted during this week’s Financial Times Future of the Car Summit that a lot has changed since Rimac began developing the Nevera around 2017. While EV sales are slowing, consumers around the world have access to far more affordable options than they did a few years ago.
Governments have imposed strict regulations to spur EV adoption, and several automakers have already pledged to sell only EVs by a specific date. But some are open to altering those plans. Those forces are “pushing stuff on us that we don’t want,” and people are “a little bit repulsed by it,” Mate said, leading to a decline in demand for high-end EVs that's affecting his brand.
The Nevera hypercar is still for sale. The company has already delivered more than 50 cars to customers, but it had plans to produce 150 in total.
Falling demand and a shift in consumer trends mean that a Nevera successor might have some form of combustion power, Rimac suggests.
""Rimac isn’t exclusively electric; it’s doing whatever is most exciting at the time,” he said.
A pure EV won’t cut it, but a potent hybrid might, which might be one reason the Bugatti Chiron successor is getting that wild V-16 hybrid engine. Mate revealed in 2022 that two years before merging with Bugatti, Rimac had already started developing a combustion engine. The writing was on the wall.

Volkswagen's New California Camper Van Gets More Space and Hybrid Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/718804/new-volkswagen-california-camper-van-details/,"Each trim comes with a rooftop tent and two sliding rear doors, and some trims even get a kitchen.",2024-12-25 08:53:16,"Volkswagen has redesigned its California camper van for the European market. The mini motorhome, positioned between the Caddy California and the Grand California, is available with a new hybrid powertrain and is larger than its predecessor, creating a roomier cabin.
The new camper van will be available in five trims: Beach, Beach Tour, Beach Camper, Coast, and Ocean. Every model has a rooftop tent and two sliding doors with mosquito nets. Volkswagen will offer a new awning that's optional in some markets and standard in others for both sides of the vehicle.
Inside, Volkswagen has replaced the rear bench with two individual seats. Thankfully they can still transform into a bed. It means people can still put bikes in the back without losing a sleeping space.
Engineers also redesigned the full kitchenette available on the Coast and Ocean, pushing it rearward so passengers can still exit both sides of the vehicle. Accessible from the outside, it contains a sink, a single-burner gas stove, and cabinets. Step up to the Beach Camper trim and you get a permanent rear, slide-out mini kitchen with a gas stove, two drawers, and storage.
Each of the 53-pound rear seats are removable, and each comes equipped with a drawer for additional storage. VW has placed several 45-watt USB-C charging ports throughout the cabin. Occupants even have the ability to double-tap any light switch and turn off all interior LED and background lights simultaneously.
The Beach Tour trim and higher come with VW's new camper control unit in the passenger-side C-pillar. It's one way to control the various vehicle functions, which are accessible through the infotainment system and a smartphone app.
The Ocean is the flagship model, and comes complete with two camper batteries, two 230-volt outlets (one inside and one out), heated front seats, supplemental air heating, a roof storage compartment, a folding table, and a 7.4-gallon freshwater tank.
The new camper will go on sale with three powertrain choices, shared with the Multivan. The four-cylinder, 150-horsepower turbodiesel and the 204-hp gas engines power the front wheels. The new plug-in hybrid option comes with 4Motion all-wheel drive and 245 hp. It can also tow up to 4,409 pounds.

"Lucid Air Sapphire Versus Dodge Demon 170: Again, It's Not Even Close",https://www.motor1.com/news/718666/lucid-air-sapphire-drag-races-demon-170/,One of these cars was built specifically built for the drag strip. The other has all-wheel drive and tons of power.,2024-12-25 08:53:18,"The Lucid Air Sapphire drag racing chronicles continue. In the last few weeks, we've seen the 1,234-horsepower electric sedan clock a 1.77-second sprint from zero to 60 mph while running an 8.9-second quarter-mile time. That was a solo pass, and it backed up that performance by easily beating its direct competitor in the marketplace, the Tesla Model S Plaid.
The Dodge Challenger Demon 170 is not a Lucid Air competitor. One could easily argue these vehicles are polar opposites, but they do have one thing in common. Both are capable of running under 9 seconds at the drag strip. And now, we have them side-by-side in the latest DragTimes video. On paper, this should be a very close race. Reality, however, is a bit different.
Before we get to that, here's a quick review of the players. The Demon 170 is literally built to live the quarter-mile life. It has 1,025 horsepower from its supercharged V-8, and yes, it's filled with E85 so the engine computer should have all that power available for the runs. Big ol' drag tires are mounted on the back, and inside, you'll find just one seat for the driver. It's completely stock as ordered from the factory, right down to the Demon's dragstrip-tuned suspension that lets it pull wheelies off the line.
But the Lucid Air Sapphire is also factory stock. It has 1,234 hp from a tri-motor powertrain, but you won't find drag slicks on this sizable four-door sedan. It's running Michelin Pilot Sport street tires, and the interior is awash with seats for people to sit in front and back. It's not tuned for drag racing, but that doesn't stop it from beating everything at the track.
And without additional drama, that includes the Demon 170. Despite being built specifically for quarter-mile dragstrips, the Challenger loses this race at every step of the battle. The Demon's best run of three is the first pass where it goes 9.49 at 144.8 mph. But the Sapphire turns the quarter in 9.01 seconds at 153 mph, and it even leaves the line harder despite not having drag tires. The Air Sapphire's all-wheel drive claws its way to a 1.44-second 60-foot time, indicating it's launching very hard. The Demon launches hard too, but at 1.48 seconds, it's not hard enough.
What's next for the Lucid Air Sapphire? We're still holding out hope for a showdown with the Rimac Nevara. That should be quite a match, but until then, Lucid just might own the title for the world's quickest quarter-mile production car.

My Quad-Motor Go-Kart Broke Under Full Power,https://www.motor1.com/features/718121/quad-motor-go-kart-fixes/,A few fixes are in order before we power the front motors.,2024-12-25 08:53:20,"Adding voltage to an electric motor will increase its speed. Adding current will give it more torque. In the case of my quad-motor go-kart, the voltage is not going to change much. However, its motors' current will be going up a lot.
This was the situation I found myself in, trying to hop up the current rear-wheel-drive iteration of the kart. If you’re just tuning in, I’m making a quad-motor go-kart with a maximum potential output of 20 kilowatts, or around 26 horsepower. This is one part of my journey to unlock the full potential of this platform.
The factory-rated power for the motors—what voltage and current they can sustain indefinitely without overheating—is 2500 watts or around 50 amps at 48 volts. I planned to double the current, which is sustainable for short runs. As it turns out, though, overheating was the least of my worries.
All motors have two parts: the rotor and the stator. As you might glean from the name of the stator, it remains stationary while the rotor spins around or inside it. The rotor is what the actual wheel and tire are connected to.
The stator, in the case of every hub motor I've seen, is connected to a shaft which is either clamped or bolted onto the body/suspension of the vehicle. The hub motors of the popular hoverboard product, for instance, are simply clamped to the chassis. You can buy those motors cheaply on eBay, for what it’s worth. They don’t have integrated mechanical brakes, they aren’t very powerful, and they're a small diameter.
Mine are threaded, but a flat spot is milled on either side of the shaft in order to provide a sort of keyway to keep the stator from spinning. It would be nice if the threads on the shaft were reversed as well, so that if the stator did spin it would simply be tightening itself down instead of loosening (this is foreshadowing). That’s asking a lot of Alibaba, though.
My old three-wheel karts only ever put down around one kilowatt of power to an eight-inch wheel, so I never even needed a keyway. I just torqued the motor down with a ratchet slotted into the end of a jack handle, as is standard procedure. This time I figured that wouldn't work, because it didn’t on the Motocompacto Type R. So I slipped some heavy stainless steel keys over the motor shaft which were bolted to the frame. With these installed, I went out for my first test.
The first indication that those keys wouldn’t be enough was how fast this thing was, even on the motor’s recommended continuous power. The throttle really needs some tuning because it’s twitchy in the mid-range. As soon as you go near the pedal it sends a ton of current to the rear wheels, lurching the kart forward. There’s also a slight delay between coming off the throttle and the regenerative brakes engaging, which I’ve never experienced before. Not sure how to fix that.
My decision to add no caster in the steering also became very evident at higher speeds. Let me explain myself here.
I add ""sophisticated"" features to my karts one at a time so I can wrap my head around them and make sure they work. In this instance, that sophistication was kingpin inclination. Caster was something I didn’t feel like I had to do. My other karts didn’t have it and they handled just fine.
Plus, when the kart had suspension, I expected it to sag down under my weight, giving caster naturally. When I locked out the suspension, though, I didn’t add any caster back in. Ultimately, it’s all my fault.
The result of this extra power, combined with other design flaws, is terror. The steering feels heavier as the speed increases, but it’s also trying to dart all over the place. The steering wheel itself is also only connected to the steering column with two nuts done up against each other.
Since the steering force has gone up, the wheel slips at high speeds. I turn the wheel and the kart does not turn at the worst possible time. This was another one of those features that worked great on my smaller karts but did not translate at all to this bigger one.
All of these things came to a head in the same corner. And when I got back to my garage, I discovered the motors had rounded out those stainless keys like they were made of butter. All the wires were twisted into a pigtail.
Addressing these problems required a mix of actual fixes and some, uh, resourceful tweaks I made instead of rebuilding the steering.
I wasn’t going to turn the power down, so I needed thicker keys to hold the motor shaft straight. How about two pieces of three-eighth-inch steel? Good luck spinning that.
To fix the steering, I did two things. I tightened the nuts connecting every component on the kart and took some air out of the front tires. Hopefully, this would help dampen out some of those lack-of-caster impulses.
I also wanted to know why the regen wasn’t engaging properly, so I got a cheap tablet on Amazon and linked the inverter to it via Bluetooth. This way, I could track the current going in and out of the motor as well as monitor other diagnostics.
Most of that stuff actually worked. The rear wheels are now locked in place, and I know I can use the same sort of clips for the front wheels when the time comes to turn those on. The steering is also a lot better now, but the column still needs to be replaced with a keyed shaft.
The tablet didn’t tell me much about the regen problem, but at least now I have a full set of gauges to monitor the kart. I’m not sure how that’s going to work when I add another two inverters, though. Two tablets? Unclear.
Altogether, the kart now feels pretty good, but all of those small issues still exist in the back of my mind. The steering will eventually loosen, the regen still feels sketchy, etc. I need actual solutions to those problems, not temporary fixes.
There are a few other small changes to make to the kart too, but I’m going to experiment with putting that stuff on video for the next installment. I think a lot of this will be clearer and more interesting in that form. Until then, sit tight.

The New Honda Prelude Hybrid Will Reportedly Make 207 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/718255/honda-prelude-dimensions-horsepower-specs/,And it will be nearly identical in size to the Toyota GR86.,2024-12-25 08:53:21,"At last year's Tokyo Auto Show, Honda surprised everyone by revealing the Honda Prelude Concept. The company has already confirmed it'll eventually produce the two-door hybrid coupe, and a new report from Best Car Web provides an insight into the car's alleged powertrain details, dimensions, and Japanese price.
We already know it'll have a hybrid powertrain, which the chief engineer Tomoyuki Yamagami said would serve as a ""prelude"" to Honda's future electric vehicles. Best Car believes it'll have the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder e:HEV engine that powers the Accord and Civic hybrids, making a bit more than both with a combined 207 horsepower. The last Prelude in 2001 made 200 hp in the US.
The Prelude will supposedly measure 169.3 inches long, 70.5 inches wide, and 51.2 inches tall with a 101.4-inch wheelbase. That makes it bigger than the two-seat Mazda MX-5 Miata at 154.1 inches long, which isn't surprising, and nearly identical to the Toyota GR86 in size with matching wheelbases.
Honda is reportedly positioning it as a premium model positioned above the two-door Toyota. It'll apparently cost ¥4.2 to ¥4.5 million ($27,325 at $29,277 today’s exchange rate) in Japan, more than the ¥2.9- to ¥3.6-million ($18,867 to $23,422) GR86, but it’s best to the the publication’s report with a big grain of salt as its past reports haven’t always been accurate.
The Prelude isn't expected to arrive until the second half of 2025, and it won't be the ""sportiest, zippiest car"" in the world, so temper your track-day expectations. It is also unclear whether Honda plans to sell it in the United States. The automaker is developing the Prelude in both left- and right-hand-drive configurations, so there's a chance we might get it here, but nothing is official.

Should You Buy An EV Track Car?,https://www.motor1.com/features/718124/buy-ev-track-car-hyundai-ioniq/,"Hyundai’s boxy Ioniq 5 N provides a best-case argument, but lap times aren’t the limiting factor for go-fast EVs.",2024-12-25 08:53:22,"Alright, I’m a believer now.
EVs can stir up joy like nearly any production track tool, so long as they follow Hyundai’s lead.
But just because something can perform a task doesn’t make it the best tool for the job. Or even a particularly good one. (Shout out to my long-suffering Tacoma, which sinks against its bump stops like some soggy peasant when hauling a yard of soil from Home Depot).
During the media drive of the Ioniq 5 N at Laguna Seca, the Hyundai hammered down the track’s front straight, again and again without fatigue. This hot hatch’s hole-shot pace would heat check many supercars, and in the corners, you could play it scalpel-neat or flick the Hyundai’s tail against the exit curbing like Ott Tänak.
But each successive lap left me wondering, ""Could you actually own one of these as a dual-purpose daily driver track special? Should you?""
In our first drive of the car, I answered the question in a couple sentences, but the review was not solely focused on the I5N’s viability as a track car. Inquiring minds will want to know, could you actually daily an EV track car and enjoy it?
Let’s break it down.
Track days are not race days, but anyone who says pride’s off the line is lying. Nobody spends $67,000 on a track special to point by a Spec Miata. Thankfully, Hyundai's N department handled this one.
By any objective performance measure, this 4,861-pound, crossover-sized hot hatch performs miracles. Hyundai says it’ll hit sixty in 3.2 seconds from a stop, but my butt dyno says it’s slightly quicker (note: my butt dyno was calibrated by several years testing vehicle performance for Road & Track). Same goes for lateral grip, though I think Pirelli left a fair amount of performance on the table in favor of longevity and civility. I wonder aloud what a set of the stickiest Michelin Cup tires would unlock here.
German publication Sport Auto clocked a 7:45 at the Nurburgring in a bone-stock I5N. It’s not the production EV record, mind you, but mind the context as well. That’s within striking distance of the Lexus LFA. That’s 997 Turbo fast. It’s on par with the Civic Type R, yet another giant slayer with racetrack bona fides, and a sniff slower than the 991.2 911 S.
Watch the onboard video itself. Unlike most performance EVs, including the record-holding Porsche Taycan Turbo GT, the I5N thrives under track abuse rather than merely tolerating it. The Hyundai’s cooling-centric powertrain design allows it two full laps of the ‘Ring before a recharge, with battery, brake, and tire temps in check the whole way. A Tesla will do three quarters of a ‘Ring lap before you’ve cooked it.
This is a meaningful distinction for track-day dorks; In capable hands, the I5N is quick enough to scrap with anything, whether it's your outlap, or the end of a standard 30-minute HPDE session.
You never simply arrive and drive. You’re hauling a the set of track-centric wheels and tires, a floor jack, a big honkin’ torque wrench, the cordless impact driver, a pop-up tent, and at least a few more track-specific odds and ends.
Again, you’re good with the I5N. A Hyundai rep said the car’s hatch will swallow a full set of four 21-inch spares, and the eyeball test suggests there’s plenty more room for track day accoutrement in the rear hold, plus a passenger up front. I can’t tell you how many times I drove a BMW E36 to and from the track with a great greasy Hoosier riding shotgun. Thankfully, that’s not necessary here.
Thermal management is any go-fast production car’s greatest foil. Ask anyone who drove the last-gen Civic Type R on a hot track. This rule counts double for EVs, which generate heat from their batteries, brakes, and tires like a reactor in thermal runaway.
The Ioniq 5 N, for example, totes something like a ton of batteries in its belly. Every time you go full throttle down a straightaway, those batteries generate monster power for the motors. This process generates monster heat in turn, degrading the battery’s State Of Charge.
I lost roughly 13 percent SOC for every three hot laps of Laguna, plus a moderately paced cooldown lap. At roughly two-and-a-quarter miles per lap, that meant 10 miles of lapping per session and 40 miles of on-track driving. After three sessions, the I5N’s SOC dropped from 94 to 54 percent. You could extrapolate that range to your local track, to gauge viability. Expect they Hyundai’s State-Of-Charge to drop further than the 13-percent-per-10-miles relationship would suggest, if you go out for longer sessions.
That’s the price of the I5N’s inertia. It takes huge brakes, an aggressive tune of the regenerative braking feature (which generates more heat), and ample tire to rein the I5N into a slow corner from a fast straight.
We did a few sessions at Laguna Seca, the first included a sighting lap and then three quick-ish laps, plus a cool-down. A couple more sessions followed with three laps each and a cool-down. I kept a curious eye on the front and rear motor temps, and the battery temp, which found an operating window and deviated little across the course of a given lap. The brakes held up to the I5N’s monster curb weight just fine, as did the Pirellis, though those did start to go a bit greasy as the sessions wore on.
A special note on the stock Pirellis. They’re quite talkative, leading you up to their limit with a hearty wraowraowraowraow. That additional feedback helps the I5N along on its mission to re-engage the driver’s senses, as does the tires’ penchant for a clean and linear breakaway between gripping and slipping.
I had a lengthy conversation with a Pirelli engineer on the project. He insisted that designing an EV track tire isn’t so different from designing for any OEM project; You provide the client a balance between performance, longevity, and civility, tailored to their taste. But performance-EV tires suffer tremendously at the hands of three-ton curb weights, paired to the instant snap of torque, and warp-speed acceleration. For the most part, the Pirellis held up just fine at Laguna.
I checked shoulder wear visually between our lapping sessions and felt around for how heat was soaking into the tires. All seemed well. No chunks or fissures broke out of the tires’ treads or shoulders. No excess hot spots across their breadth. Honestly, I was impressed by how well these tires handled the Ioniq’s considerable mass.
However, I suspect our lapping sessions were kept brief for a reason. The physics at work here would surely punish any set of tires, regardless of brand or compound, over longer HPDE sessions. I’d recommend taking advantage of the I5N’s cargo space, finding a cheap set of lightweight alloys (18” wheels fit on the I5N Cup car, which is mechanically identical) and some tires aimed at durability, rather than ultimate lap times.
Alright, here’s the rub. In every performance metric, the I5N is absolutely ready for your next track day. But as with garden-variety EV adoption, charging is the hang-up. Or, rather, a lack of charging infrastructure.
If your track doesn’t have an 800-volt fast charger, which it almost certainly doesn’t, you’re probably SOL. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, or that you can’t get a decent amount of lapping in under perfect conditions.
I’d bet at most tracks in America, you could get away with a pair of 30-minute lapping sessions in the morning, a break for off-site fast charging over lunch, then a few more 15-minute sessions in the afternoon, with enough battery left to get you home before rush hour. That’s not exactly a double stint at LeMans, but many outfits that run track days limit participants to sessions around 15-20 minutes, lest the Red Mist descends.
For a small percentage of Americans who live close enough to a race track and have access to at-home charging, I think the I5N could fit nicely
It should be said Hyundai is actively working to build and/or facilitate the building of fast chargers at race tracks. But this will take broader interest from consumers to seal the deal. Race tracks are often in remote locations, which in turn requires significant investment to upgrade even simple infrastructure, let alone infrastructure to facilitate an incredibly niche.
We’re just not there yet. Not even close. But cars like the I5N bridge the gap between performance EVs and the track day workflow we’re accustomed to. Ultimately, it won’t be up to the automakers to deliver a product that’s track-capable. Hyundai’s just done it. Mass adoption of EV track cars will depend entirely on the charging infrastructure at or near the track.
For now, the track-day masses wait.
But a select few—those in fair-weather states who live close to a race track with fast charging nearby—will have a ball with the Ioniq 5 N. For the price, you won’t find much that’ll lap your local bull ring any quicker. Remember, a base Cayman starts at $68,300 and for that price, its owner will have the pleasure of waving by an EV hatchback with the badge of a Korean upstart on the hood and a grinning face behind the wheel.

Stellantis Could Put Gas Engines Back in EVs if There's Enough Demand,https://www.motor1.com/news/718129/stellantis-will-put-combustion-engines-in-evs/,"Company CFO Natalie Knight emphasized the flexible nature of the platforms, but that doesn't mean the EV revolution won't happen.",2024-12-25 08:53:24,"Stellantis has ambitious plans to have an entirely electric passenger-vehicle lineup in Europe by 2030. In the United States, the goal is 50 percent. This is the crux of the conglomerate's Dare Forward 2030 plan, and despite the cooldown on EVs in the US, it's still full-speed ahead. But that doesn't mean the company won't build combustion-powered cars if that's what buyers want.
That's the takeaway from a recent report by WardsAuto, which cites Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight talking about the flexibility to build combustion-powered vehicles from electric platforms. It's not the first time we've heard a Stellantis executive talk about flexibility, but the report presents things in a broader spectrum. In short, if demand is there for a combustion version of an EV, Stellantis is open to building it.
""I don’t want to ignore the fact that we want to stay close to the consumer, and if we see there’s an opportunity with those models that we introduced as a BEV first, we’ll look at that,"" she said, according to WardsAuto.
Despite its all-electric endgame, Stellantis has a fresh range of STLA platforms designed to accommodate either electric or combustion powertrains. The company sees it as an advantage going forward, and why not? As the auto industry pivots from combustion to electric, having such flexibility is certainly an advantage. But one can't help but contemplate the larger question here. What happens if, come 2030, 75 percent of buyers in the US want a combustion vehicle? Will that override the 50-percent plan outlined in Dare Forward 2030?
While the future is uncertain, a Stellantis spokesperson confirmed to us that, as of now, the company isn't changing or reconsidering aspects of its 2030 goal. 50 percent electric in the US and 100 percent in Europe is still the plan. In Europe, EV sales are still doing well. Things stateside aren't quite as rosy, though some models are doing better than others. But, 2030 is just six years away. Unless the automotive market makes a significant adjustment, a new-car lineup that's 50 percent electric could be a hard sell for US buyers.

Pininfarina Made An Electric Batmobile You Can Actually Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/718046/pininfarina-b95-battista-batman/,"If you have as much money as Bruce Wayne, of course.",2024-12-25 08:53:25,"Automobili Pininfarina has created a new line of ultra-exclusive cars that take their styling inspiration from Batman’s civilian persona, Bruce Wayne. The two models—the B95 and Battista—feature unique design touches tailored to make you feel like the billionaire comic book hero.
Pininfarina created two trims for its two cars: Gotham and Dark Knight. Gotham cars feature tan leather upholstery, bespoke center panel quilting, and tan stitching. The other trim uses black Alcantara, black leather upholstery, and black and gold duo-tone contrast stitching.
The Gotham Battista wears Argento Vittorio gloss paint on its exterior and has a Nero Torino roof. Pininfarina backlit its iconic logo, finishing it in brushed and polished anodized aluminum. The car has 20-inch front and 21-inch rear alloy wheels with gloss-black faces and matte-black rims. The B95 wheels closely match the Battista’s, featuring matte-black inner and gloss-black outer rings.
The Dark Knight Battista and B95 have Nero Profondo exteriors and Nero Torino roofs. They also share the same ceramic-polished rims.
Each car has a 120.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery powering four electric motors that generate 1,900 horsepower. The B95 and Battista can fly to 62 miles per hour in less than two seconds. The displays feature Wayne Enterprises enhancements and an instruction voice modeled after Alfred Pennyworth.
Pininfarina also tweaked the Battista’s aerodynamics, giving it new tailgate shark fins, louver openings, and rear carbon wings. It also has Wayne Enterprises logos on the side skirts and roof.
The special Pininfarina cars are the latest in a line of new products looking to wring every bit of value out of the Batman brand. The automaker and Wayne Enterprises, a luxury brand developed by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products, will launch their partnership at BruceWayneX.com and host an “invite-only, first-of-its-kind retail theatre concept” this summer where a lucky few will get to see a Battista. The site also has limited-edition jet skis, bicycles, and the iconic Tumbler from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy.
Pininfarina doesn't how much these two Batman-themed special editions might cost, but the Battista starts at $2.2 million and the B95 costs $4.8 million. So you'll need to be as rich as Bruce Wayne.

Italdesign’s 777-HP Concept Car Is Almost a Pickup Truck,https://www.motor1.com/news/717878/italdesign-quintessenza-ev-concept-truck/,"The rear roof comes off, exposing a small bed accessible via an electronic tailgate.",2024-12-25 08:53:27,"Italdesign’s latest creation blends a sleek GT car with a pickup truck to create a vehicle tailer-made for looking up at the stars. It’s up for debate as to whether the Quintessenza succeeds at being either body style, as it’s just a concept, but the EV’s sleek design hides some wild styling features that should excite the stargazer in all of us.
The Quintessenza is big. It’s longer than the shortest Ford F-150, with a lengthier 127.6-inch wheelbase. All that space helps accommodate four seats with a central console running down the middle that houses the infotainment controls and other switches. It also contains an organizer and a refrigerated mini-bar large enough to fit a bottle of wine and two glasses.
You’ll want a drink when you flip around the rear seats and remove the rear hardtop, opening the cabin to the outside world. The center console can slide back, bringing the mini bar right to you as you recline the rear seats and enjoy the sights.
At the front of the cabin, a floating central dashboard at the base of the windshield blends into the doors and wraps to the rear of the car. Italdesign made the dashboard out of a marble-based fabric that hides the controls underneath until needed, using a projection-based system to display them. It sounds fancy and fussy.
The primary vehicle interface is located behind the steering wheel, which is nothing more than a dock for your smartphone, which connects with the car through a unique app. Users can control various vehicle settings through the phone, which can also display vital information when it’s docked, such as battery level, speed, turn signals, and more.
The minimalist interior is serene compared to the rugged exterior. The Quintessenza has chunky fender flares over 24-inch wheels, sharp vertical and horizontal lighting elements front and rear, and a fastback roof that hides the truck bed. It can adjust its ground clearance from 7.9 to 11.0 inches. There are even full-length scissor doors and an electronically powered tailgate.
Powering the EV is a 150-kilowatt-hour battery feeding three electric motors—one front-axle drive unit and two in-wheel rear-axle motors. The total output is 777 horsepower, and it can reach 62 miles per hour in less than three seconds, but Italdesign doesn't mention anything about towing or payload capacities.
Either way, this thing is cool. While it probably won't ever see production, we're glad it exists.

"Four Companies Are Still Interested In Saving Fisker, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/717836/fisker-four-automakers-interested/,So you're saying there's a chance?,2024-12-25 08:53:28,"Fisker has had a bumpy few months, to say the least. After the company said it would need to partner with another automaker before it went bankrupt, talks with Nissan fell apart. Then Fisker quickly slashed prices on inventory for a version of the Ocean SUV that may or may not even exist. But there’s still a small glimmer of hope.
According to Business Insider, CEO Henrik Fisker held an all-hands meeting last week and told employees that at least four automakers are still interested in a potential stake in the company. ""We do have four car companies that have signed NDAs,"" Fisker told his employees last week. ""However, they obviously need time to get to some diligence.""
Fisker didn’t provide a timetable or any specifics on which companies might be interested. Nissan almost certainly won’t be one of them after talks fell apart following a rumored $400-million deal that would kickstart production of the Alaska pickup and a separate electric pickup for Nissan.
If Fisker doesn’t strike a deal with any of these four automakers within the next 30 days, bankruptcy could be inevitable. The company reportedly has just $54 million in cash equivalencies and says that will ""not be sufficient to meet its current obligations."" This comes months after the company delivered hundreds of cars while failing to collect millions of dollars worth of payment.
We’ll see in the next few weeks if Fisker is able to strike a deal and stay afloat, or if bankruptcy is right around the corner.

Here's An Exceedingly Nerdy Explanation of GM's Ultium Battery System,https://www.motor1.com/features/717675/gm-ultium-battery-deep-dive/,"We spoke with Jerry Beemer, the head of GM’s EV Propulsion team.",2024-12-25 08:53:30,"The Cadillac Lyriq is one of the first vehicles to use GM’s Ultium platform. This drivetrain system now underpins all of its current and upcoming electric vehicles, other than the outgoing Chevy Bolt EV. After driving the Lyriq and liking it very much, I was interested in the precise details of the car’s pack and the larger Ultium system. So I interviewed Jerry Beemer, who leads GM’s EV Propulsion team. If you want to know everything about this system down to the individual cells, he’s your guy.
The Ultium platform currently consists of packs made from the same building blocks. The core of this system is the Ultium battery cell, a long and slender 103 amp-hour (Ah)  pouch utilizing a derivative of the nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) chemistry. That means a peak voltage of around 4.2V and a nominal voltage of around 3.6V. The upcoming Chevy Bolt will allegedly be on the same platform but will utilize a lithium-iron-phosphate chemistry. That means the peak cell voltage will be around 3.65V, with nominal coming in around 3.2V.
It’s unclear if these cells will take the same shape as the current Ultium cells, but Beemer told me the cell itself is not vital to the platform. In China, for instance, “We sell Lyriqs with a module-based pack like we have today, but it’s a different chemistry, a different form factor of prismatic cans in those packs” Beemer said.
In other words, key things like the battery management system, module-centric pack construction, and other details, like how power electronics communicate with each other are what make Ultium what it is. The system is not defined by the 103Ah cell that most of GM’s North American EVs use.
Speaking of these cells, 24 are stuffed into each of the Lyriq’s modules in a 8S 3P configuration, giving a nominal module voltage of roughly 29V. Every module is wired in series to achieve the Lyriq’s 96S pack configuration. This detail belies GM’s confidence in its lower voltage architecture. A rework in module construction would be required to push the voltage higher. Because of this, vehicles carrying fewer modules than the Lyriq will likely operate at a lower voltage.
The Hummer EV utilizes the same cells and modules, however the pack configuration of that monster is 96S 6P—effectively two Lyriq packs stacked on top of each other. The Hummer drives its motors at 400V but can charge at 800V thanks to contactors that wire the pack’s two halves in series, effectively providing a 192S 3P layout.
In terms of feeding the drivetrain with that higher voltage, Beemer said the automaker “looked at 800 volts… in the context of full-line manufacturing.”
However, GM doesn’t believe higher drive voltages are a key piece of the puzzle, at least right now. “[I won’t] say that we won’t ever go there,” Beemer told me, but he indicated that driving lower costs by building production volume was a more important first step.
The lower voltage clearly isn’t hurting the system’s discharge rates. The Hummer’s battery, despite operating in the region of 400V, can still provide a burst of 745 kilowatts (1,000 horsepower). The AWD Lyriq with half of the modules can logically provide a peak output of around 373 kW (500 hp).
The Lyriq can charge at 190kW continuously from a station. Calculating a peak charge voltage is difficult because GM is understandably cagey about revealing the Ultium cell’s charge and discharge voltage buffer—other automakers developing battery packs would love to know that kind of thing.
This buffer is the difference between the calculated pack capacity with a known peak voltage, derived from the chemistry, and the stated usable capacity from GM. To be precise, each cell is not getting charged to its max of around 4.2V and is not discharged to its minimum of 2.0V-2.8V mostly for the sake of cycle life and safety. A peak estimate of 4.1V would mean a charging voltage of 393.6V.
In terms of burst charging under regenerative braking, the Lyriq can harvest up to an observed 240 kW, which speaks to the confidence GM has in the system. If it were conservative, we wouldn’t see regenerative braking figures much higher than the pack’s continuous charge rate.
It will be even more interesting to see where the automaker takes these charge/discharge rates in the Lyriq V, which is a widely speculated performance version of the car. It will likely push these charge/discharge limits even higher, perhaps without changing out the core cell.
Indeed, Beemer said the automaker has “not realized the full potential” of the unit yet. In the case of GM, this means working out the physics of what should happen to the cell/module/pack under certain conditions, and correlating that information to test data.
“The vast majority of our work now is analytical and then supported by a few key tests that validate,” Beemer said.
So while GM applies its 103 Ah cell in the 8S 3P module to most of its EVs, testing data may indicate that different configurations are possible. As the automaker gets further into electrification, we can expect more potential to be unlocked from whatever form factor seems ideal, whether it’s pouches, cylindrical cells, or prismatic cans.
An exciting time in the world of electric vehicles.

The G80 EV Magma Is the Hottest Concept From Genesis Yet,https://www.motor1.com/news/717469/genesis-g80-ev-magma-concept/,"The concept has a performance-tuned suspension, a body kit, and a stunning blue paint job.",2024-12-25 08:53:31,"The Genesis performance sub-brand Magma is back with a new car. But unlike previous concepts, this one isn't orange. The G80 EV Magma Concept sports a color called Acme Blue. Chosen not because of its electric powertrain, but because blue is the hottest part of a flame, according to Genesis.
Does this mean the G80 EV Magma Concept is the fastest car from the brand yet? There's no way to tell right now. Debuting at Auto China in Beijing, Genesis talks about suspension upgrades, bigger brakes, and aesthetic changes to give the concept a meaner stance. But the company's remained mum on powertrain specs so far.
The production-spec Electrified G80 gets a dual-motor arrangement generating a modest 365 horsepower. While it's unclear whether the Magma Concept uses a version of this powertrain or something totally different, we're confident there's more power on tap.
Instead of harping on output, Genesis focuses on the concept's wider fenders, new rear fascia with an integrated diffuser, and a small ducktail spoiler on the trunk lid. There's also a new fascia at the front with larger air intakes, and blacked-out trim. The G80 EV Magma Concept rides on an ""advanced suspension system"" that lowers the car, but specific changes aren't outlined. Larger brakes are mounted behind custom 21-inch wheels that look identical to those on the GV60 Magma Concept, albeit with blue highlights. Interior upgrades include Alcantara and quilted leather with carbon fiber trim.
This isn't the first performance-focused G80 we've seen. Earlier this year, Genesis announced a limited-run model for the Middle East market called the Magma Special. That one isn't electric, with rumors suggesting it could have a 500-horsepower version of the sedan's 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6. It's also not the first electric Magma we've seen—that honor goes to the aforementioned GV60 that debuted at the end of March at the New York Auto Show.
The latest debut expands the Magma family, though at this time it's unknown if this concept will see production.

Toyota's Hybrid Truck System Will Be a Game-Changer. Here's How It Works,https://www.motor1.com/features/717505/toyota-i-force-max-hybrid-truck-explainer/,The chief engineers of Toyota’s mid-size trucks explain the new four-cylinder hybrids.,2024-12-25 08:53:31,"Toyota has built hybrids for over a quarter-century now, but only recently started electrifying its trucks. It’s a big deal, because the automakers' trucks have always been defined by their absolute dependability. Consequently, they’ve always lagged behind the market in terms of powertrain technology. For trucks, Toyota likes to stick with what it knows works, rather than coming up with something new for newness sake.
Now, Toyota has two hybrid truck powertrains, one with a twin-turbo V-6 for the Tundra and Sequoia, and one with a single-turbo four-cylinder for the Tacoma, 4Runner, and Land Cruiser. At the first drive for the Land Cruiser and Tacoma hybrid, we took a deep dive into the four-cylinder setup.
“For environmental concerns, America obviously has strict regulations, so for us, to ensure that as many customers as possible can enjoy the vehicle… there was a need for us to take on the challenge to improve the environmental friendliness and also the fuel efficiency,” said Ketia Moritsu, chief engineer for the new 4Runner and Land Cruiser, through an interpreter.
It’s called i-Force Max, and it’s not really like Toyota’s long-running Prius hybrid system. In fact, it’s a lot simpler to understand. Here, you have a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, an eight-speed automatic, and a 48-horsepower electric motor-generator sandwiched in between. The motor is powered by (and charges up) a 1.9-kilowatt-hour Nickel-Metal-Hydride battery mounted under the rear seats. Total system output is 326 hp and 465 pound-feet of torque.

“[The motor] is fundamentally designed to really support that part of the torque ramp and power ramp where you know the turbos are coming up to speed,” said Sheldon Brown, chief engineer for the Tacoma. “It helps us with our peak torque and then of course, when our turbo efficiency starts to fall off, it can come back in and assist.”
Because of the small battery, the Tacoma Hybrid doesn’t have a dedicated EV mode. It can drive around on pure electricity at the ECU’s discretion, briefly, at low speeds, and the system can shut off the engine for coasting on the highway. Fuel economy isn’t the priority either. Compared with their gas-only equivalents, hybrid Tacomas get around 2 mpg more in the city, 1 mpg more on the highway, and 1 mpg more combined. Really, this is about performance.
“We didn’t follow the path of just a hybrid system that focuses on fuel economy,” Moritsu explained. “So powerful, torquey, agile, maneuverability, and performance, those were the priorities. And we were able to balance that with the environmental performance of the vehicle as well. That was the biggest challenge for development.”
In terms of reliability, the hybrid system itself shouldn’t prove too problematic. Moritsu assured us of this. Toyota’s used Nickel-Metal-Hydride battery chemistry since the beginning, and while this isn’t the most energy dense, it's a well-proven technology. “We love it for its durability,” Brown said.
The electric motor itself is a fairly simple device, too. Really, the big concern for reliability in a truck is the engine.
“First and foremost, a lot of the truck duty cycle is really happening on the engine side,” Brown explained.
The 2.4-liter in the Tacoma is shared with many other Toyota products, notably the Highlander and Grand Highlander. But it’s very different for the trucks.
“There are internal components to the engine that are also specced up, maybe bearing coatings as an example, something that are going to see a longer or higher duty cycle,” Brown said. “Specifically when we start to think about things like the turbo, for example, it's really important that we think about truck duty cycles, they're gonna be towing, which means you're gonna be in the boost mode a lot more. You might be lugging in a reduction gear, which means your RPMs are up. Especially on these trucks, you're going to be giving it the beans, running through the desert. So we go to our commercial grade in terms of design requirements as well as our testing protocols for those.”
That means designing for a 50-percent longer duty cycle, and for more truck-specific scenarios. “We take the time to really consider how the truck is used,” Brown said “These trucks are going to be crawling up big hills, going down. We take a look at how the oil is actually moving throughout the engine, making sure that you're not starving the engine for oil when you're crawling up a 30-percent grade.”

Using a conventional automatic transmission enables a good tow rating and the inclusion of a low-range transfer case, an off-roading essential. Though this actually did present a problem. In the Tacoma, for example, the low-range gear is 2.57:1, which is a big torque multiplier when you’ve got 465 pound-feet on tap. Brown told us Toyota actually had to change the throttle map for 4-Low, to make sure drivers can manage all that torque when precise control is needed.
We tested the four-cylinder hybrid powertrain earlier this month in both the Land Cruiser and Tacoma. Off-road, the calibration is such that you don’t even really notice the hybrid powertrain at work. Which was the goal.
“We were in a review one time, and I said to [the engineering teams], ‘The highest compliment I can give you is this was unremarkable because it just did everything I wanted to do when I wanted it to,’” Brown said.
On the road, the torque of the hybrid system is noticeable compared with the standard gas-only Tacoma, but again, it all works seamlessly. You don’t think about the fact that it’s a hybrid.
Only time can reveal if this powertrain ranks up there with Toyota’s best, but know that these are nameplates the company takes very seriously. If Toyota is going to go hybrid for trucks, it can’t miss. On early exposure, it seems they haven’t.

The Company Behind the Hummer EV Camper Conversion Just Went Out of Business,https://www.motor1.com/news/717488/gmc-hummer-ev-earthcruiser-out-of-business/,EarthCruiser's last day of operations is April 25.,2024-12-25 08:53:33,"Pour one out for EarthCruiser. The Oregon-based company that built a modest range of overlanding vehicles is officially out of business. In a statement posted to EarthCruiser's website, the company's last day of business is Thursday, April 25.
Changes in the market and economic factors are cited in EarthCruiser's announcement as reasons for the closure.
""Our journey over the past years has been extraordinary,” said Lance Gillies, EarthCruiser CIO and founder. ""We are incredibly grateful to our loyal customers, dedicated employees, and industry partners for their support and trust in our brand. Although this decision marks the end of an era, we are proud of our legacy and impact on the world of travel, automotive innovation, and overlanding. We hope our vehicles, our customers, and their stories will continue to inspire the adventurous spirit in all of us.""
EarthCruiser was founded in 2008, and offered a handful of camper conversion builds based on a variety of vehicles. The least expensive choice was the $350,000 Terranova, built on a Ford Super Duty or Ram 3500 one-ton pickup truck platform. For a starting price of $595,000, EarthCruiser had the single-cab FX or dual-cab EXP, utilizing a four-wheel-drive Isuzu platform with V-8 power.
There was also the GMC Hummer EV EarthCruiser, which debuted in August 2023. The upfit added a carbon-fiber camper shell with a power-operated roof, creating space to stand up as well as room for a full-size bed. It added a small kitchen and shower to the off-road EV, powered by a 605-watt solar system and a 6-kilowatt-hour battery. With sizable tanks for fresh and gray water, EarthCruiser said it was capable of off-grid living for seven days.
Deliveries for the GMC Hummer EV EarthCruiser were to begin this summer, but that's obviously not happening. In an email to Motor1, an EarthCruiser representative confirmed that just the single demonstration model was built and has already been sold. No customer models were made, but the company is open to selling the design as part of the asset liquidation to any interested party.

The Kia EV9 GT Arrives January 2025 with 'Enormous Power',https://www.motor1.com/news/717574/kia-ev9-gt-january-2025-debut/,"Meanwhile, an updated EV6/EV6 GT and Sportage will debut later this year.",2024-12-25 08:53:35,"Kia released business results for the first quarter of 2024, full of the usual sales and financial jargon. But with that press release, the company also published a recording of its CEO's Investor Day speech that took place earlier this month. And in it we discovered some juicy details about upcoming product.
The EV9 GT will break cover in January 2025 with ""enormous power"" from an upgraded dual-motor setup. Kia says it'll do 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds, which is impressive given the large SUV’s heft, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds. We’re expecting a major power boost over the 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet offered by the most potent version on sale today. The additional oomph will help the GT version shave off more than one second from the sprint time.
Unless Kia plans to improve the battery chemistry, the range will probably to take a hit. That's what usually happens when an EV gets the performance treatment at the expense of efficiency. The EV9 GT-Line available today does 270 miles on a single charge, per EPA. Kia mentions the full-fat GT model is getting a beefier suspension setup and upgraded brakes.
This isn't the only electric Kia SUV about to spawn a GT version. Although not mentioned during the CEO Investor Day, the EV5 GT (pictured below) has already made an early appearance in China. It was recently homologated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, with images showing up on MIIT's website.
Later during the presentation, which we've attached below, a product roadmap was displayed in the background. An updated EV6 is scheduled for a market launch in the second quarter of this year. The sporty EV6 GT will follow in early Q4. Kia also plans to tweak the popular Sportage in the final quarter of the year. Elsewhere, the first-ever EV3 and new K4 are coming in Q3 when the large K8 sedan unavailable in the United States is bound to get a mid-cycle facelift.
But first, a five-door hatchback version of the also-not-for-America K3 compact sedan is coming soon.

This Lotus Evija Broke A Very Specific Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/717421/lotus-evija-x-debut/,The 6:24 lap is the fastest of any car with a chassis of a production model.,2024-12-25 08:53:35,"Remember that wild Lotus Evija X we saw last year testing at the Nürburgring? It's now finally out. Strictly a one-off, the electric beast is a track-only version of the hypercar that holds a very specific record for being the fastest vehicle around the Nordschleife with the chassis of a production car. Allow us to explain.
It completed the lap in 6 minutes and 24 seconds, or 11 seconds less than the Mercedes-AMG One. The F1-engined machine is the fastest street-legal car ever around the 'Ring. However, the Lotus Evija X is not the fastest car overall to complete a lap of the Green Hell. The Volkswagen ID.R took 6:05 while the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo remains unbeaten, at an incredible 5:19.
Because neither the ID. R nor the 919 Hybrid Evo has any connection with production models, Lotus can brag about the Evija X's performance. It's worth noting that there has been another car faster than the Lotus beyond those two. In 1983, Stefan Bellof drove the 956 to a 6:11 lap. In the same year and with the same car, Jochen Mass crossed the finish line in 6:16.
The Evija X is likely to return to the Nürburgring and try to shave off seconds from its already impressive lap time. The performance it achieved back in October 2023 was on a damp track, so there's room for improvement. Lotus says we should ""watch this space"" regarding a potentially better time.
Aside from the crazy aero with a massive wing, the track car has Pirelli slicks along with new dampers and carbon fiber brakes. Underneath the skin is the same carbon fiber tub and quad-motor setup with 2,011 horsepower and 1,257 pound-feet of torque as found in the street-legal Evija. The four electric motors draw their juice from a relatively small 70-kWh battery pack mid-mounted behind the seats.
Lotus touts a 0 to 62 mph in less than three seconds and a 62 to 124 mph in under three seconds as well. The 124 mph to 186 mph sprint is said to take less than four seconds. Flat out, the road car is electronically capped at 218 mph. The road-going Evija has entered production many years after its debut, and only 130 units will be assembled.

The Mazda Arata Is Another Attempt At An Electric SUV,https://www.motor1.com/news/717414/mazda-arata-electric-suv-concept/,"The MX-30 isn't exactly a roaring success, but Mazda isn't giving up.",2024-12-25 08:53:36,"The main star at Mazda's stand in Beijing at the Auto China 2024 is unquestionably the rear-wheel-drive electric 6 sedan. However, it's not the only premiere. A sleek-looking electric SUV concept called the Arata also debuted in China, and it's destined to go into production by the end of next year.
Much like the EZ-6 sedan, the Arata has been developed by Changan Mazda, a 50:50 joint venture between Changan Automobile and Mazda founded in late 2012. It's likely to adopt a different moniker for the production version, possibly an alphanumeric designation to echo the other SUVs. The ""EZ-60"" nameplate has already been trademarked in China and therefore might be used for this vehicle.
Meanwhile, the Arata (Japanese for ""new"" or ""fresh"") previews an attractive electric SUV that could be related to an existing product. While the EZ-6 is expected to be a reskinned Changan Depal SL03, the EZ-60 is likely to be based on the Changan Deepal S7. However, these will be more than just cases of swapping badges and calling it a day since there are major design differences. We reckon the Mazda sedan and SUV duo looks significantly more upmarket to justify what will likely be a higher price tag.
The Arata is strictly an EV, at least for now, whereas the EZ-6 going on sale this year in China will also be sold with a plug-in hybrid setup. The SUV also adopts the familiar Kodo design language and has relatively small windows and sleek lights front and rear. Just like the sedan, it gets an illuminated grille. The large ""Mazda"" script on the sides also lights up.
Since it's still a concept, it has cameras instead of conventional mirrors and also does away with door handles and a rear wiper. Mazda gave it a chunky spoiler bisected by a vertical third brake light that seems to extend to the roof panel. The design of the quarter panel gives the illusion of flying buttresses but we're not sure there's an actual hole. Nonetheless, it's an unexpected design cue to see on an SUV.
Mazda isn't saying anything about selling the sedan and SUV outside of China where the two will be manufactured. The Zoom-Zoom company has taken shy steps toward electrification but it knows EVs are inevitable. Although the MX-30 hasn't been a commercial success, to say the least, the Japanese brand is aware it must pursue electrification to survive.

These New Nissan Sedans Are a Nice Break from the SUV Madness,https://www.motor1.com/news/717406/nissan-epoch-evo-sedan-concepts/,The Epoch and Evo go against the tide to show sedans still matter.,2024-12-25 08:53:36,"The Auto China 2024 show in Beijing is in full swing, and you'll be glad to hear it's not all about crossovers and SUVs. After Mazda unveiled a new electric 6 with rear-wheel drive, here comes Nissan with a pair of its very own sedans. The Epoch is fully electric while the Evo is a plug-in hybrid and definitely not a Mitsubishi rally-bred sedan.
Created in collaboration with local partner Dongfeng Motor, the sedans are deemed as concepts but will go into production. During the press conference, Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said they're ""very close to reality"" as development has already commenced. The plan is to have the Epoch on sale within a year whereas the Evo will go on sale later.
The sedans appear to be similar in size, but we'd argue the Evo has a more daring design with a rakish roofline and a nicer derrière. Nissan is only showing the Evo’s interior, featuring a Tesla-esque minimalist approach by cramming all controls into a large tablet-like display. Unlike on the Model 3, there's still a digital instrument cluster that appears to be a smidge larger than the industry norm.
Despite carrying the Evo name that recalls performance sedans, it's a car ""perfect for weekend getaways and creating special moments for the whole family,"" per Nissan. The two models will fight in a crowded market considering automakers active in China are still offering plenty of sedans across multiple segments. The new Volkswagen Passat Pro is a relevant example since no other market gets the sedan.
Of course, Nissan couldn't miss the opportunity to show a couple of SUVs as well at the Auto China show. The electric Epic and plug-in hybrid Era follow the same design language as the two sedans and are planned to hit the market within the next three years. The Epic has bidirectional charging while the Era gets air suspension, zero-gravity seats, and four-wheel drive.

Lamborghini Urus Plug-In Hybrid Keeps the V-8 and Adds More Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/717143/lamborghini-urus-se-phev-details/,"The Lamborghini Urus SE gets a transmission-mounted electric motor that, combined with the twin-turbo V-8, delivers 789 horsepower.",2024-12-25 08:53:46,"Leave it to Lamborghini to make a plug-in hybrid SUV exciting. The new Urus SE is an electrified version of the company's best-selling model, now with more power and speed. Although a PHEV setup typically implies a downsized engine, that's not the case here. The twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is sticking around, supplemented by an electric motor.
Housed within the eight-speed automatic transmission, the e-motor produces 189 horsepower and 356 pound-feet of torque. The gasoline engine is rated at a substantial 612 hp and 590 lb-ft. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 789 hp at 6,000 rpm and a mountain-moving 701 lb-ft from 1,750 rpm.
Compared to the Urus S, the new SE is 0.1 seconds quicker to 62 mph, completing the task in 3.4 seconds. It's worth noting the Performante remains the quickest of the Urus range, at 3.3 seconds. This new raging bull reaches 124 mph in 11.4 seconds, or 1.1 second before the gas-only version, and even 0.1 seconds before the spicy Urus Performante. Flat out, it can do 194 mph, making it a tiny bit faster than both V-8-only flavors.
The Urus SE comes with a 25.7-kWh lithium-ion battery mounted below the cargo floor, good for over 37 miles of pure electric range. Driven in EV mode, the SUV tops out at 81 mph. After that, the V-8 automatically kicks in. Lamborghini goes as far as to say emissions are down by 80 percent compared to the pure ICE model.
With the plug-in hybrid, Lamborghini takes the opportunity to give the SUV a nip and tuck. Those updated matrix LED headlights now have a daytime running light signature that takes after a bull's tail, or so we're told. There are some discreet tweaks to the front section with design elements derived from the Revuelto supercar. The rear apparently takes after the Gallardo, and increases downforce by 35 percent compared to the Urus S.
Lambo will sell the electrified SUV with new 23-inch wheels, over 100 body color options, and 47 interior themes. If none of them tickle your fancy, there's also the Ad Personam program for one-off builds ... provided your bank account can handle it. The Urus SE comes with a pair of 12.3-inch screens and four new selectable modes: EV Drive, Hybrid, Performance, and Recharge. These are on top of the usual Strada, Sport, Corsa, Neve, Sabbia, and Terra.
We're wondering whether a similar V-8 PHEV setup is also planned for the Huracan replacement coming later this year. We already know Lamborghini is retiring the V-10, with plans to downsize going forward.
As for the Urus, Lamborghini has already confirmed the second-generation model will be strictly an EV when it launches in 2029. So if you want a gas-powered exotic SUV from the legendary Italian brand, get your order in now.

The Range Rover Electric Sure Looks Like the Gas Model,https://www.motor1.com/news/717046/range-rover-electric-first-images/,The first revealing images of the Range Rover EV show it's a spitting image of the ICE model.,2024-12-25 08:53:48,"After half a century of gas-guzzlers, Land Rover is turning the Range Rover into an EV. It'll be sold alongside the combustion engines and promises V-8 performance with zero emissions. The new teasers released today show the luxury SUV without camouflage because there's nothing to hide. It looks all but identical to the conventionally powered model.
The electric Mercedes G-Class debuting this week at Auto China 2024 in Beijing will follow the same recipe by largely inheriting the design from its ICE counterpart. Meanwhile, the Range Rover Electric posed for the camera while undergoing cold-weather conditions in the Arctic Circle. It endured temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Land Rover is also testing the silent SUV in the grueling deserts of the Middle East at 122 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's touted as the ""quietest and most refined Range Rover ever created"" and has a newly developed traction control system. The electric luxobarge put the setup to good use on the frozen lakes of Sweden. Compared to a standard traction control setup based on the ABS, the Rangie EV's new hardware can distribute wheel-slip management to each electric drive unit. Doing so reduces the torque reaction time at each wheel from about 100 milliseconds to only 1 millisecond.
There's also some software trickery to minimize ABS intervention and achieve a smooth ride even on slippery surfaces. Land Rover says the large EV will be motivated by a ""new in-house all-electric propulsion system."" The Tata Motors-owned brand doesn't go into details but we're expecting over 500 horsepower since the V-8 has 523 hp from a BMW-sourced 4.4-liter, twin-turbo gas engine. Maybe even more considering the Range Rover SV has 606 hp on tap.
At the very least, a dual-motor setup seems like an educated guess since the Range Rover Electric is certainly going to have four-wheel drive. The electric G-Class officially known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" is expected to feature a quad-motor setup.
Much like the go-anywhere Defender, the electric Range Rover will wade through 33.4 inches of water. It'll be underpinned by the same Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA) used by the regular SUV with combustion engines and is going to feature an 800-volt architecture for fast-charging capabilities.
The upcoming SUV will be JLR's second electric model, following the Jaguar I-Pace launched back in 2018. While the smaller EV is assembled by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, the Range Rover Electric will be manufactured at home in Solihull, UK.
The ICE-less Rangie will be a stepping stone to JLR's goal of achieving zero tailpipe emissions by 2036. Jaguar will be the first to go purely electric in the coming years.

The Mercedes-AMG GT Hybrid Has 9 Miles Of Electric Range on Purpose,https://www.motor1.com/news/716970/mercedes-amg-gt63s-e-performance-range/,The 816-horsepower hybrid's battery is intentionally compromised to offer little energy.,2024-12-25 08:53:49,"Range is almost everything when it comes to electric vehicles. It's surprising, then, to hear that a lot of hybrid cars, even plug-ins, offer very little all-electric driving range. In the case of fast hybrids like the elegantly-named Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance Coupe, this is an intentional decision. Its nine miles of electric range is more or less just a nice plus.
The new two-door performance offering from AMG has a battery because it's a good match for a high-performance combustion drivetrain. The car's 400-volt hybrid system consists of 560 individual cells optimized to offer high charge and discharge rates, as opposed to a massive amount of energy. Its 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack can discharge up to 204 horsepower (150 kilowatts) in a burst. That's more power than the outgoing Chevy Bolt, despite having a pack that's less than 1/10th the size. It can also absorb 134 horsepower (100 kilowatts) from the wheels, which is twice as fast as the Bolt could charge from a plug.
Battery cell and pack design is all about compromise. Factors like power density, energy density, cycle life, cost, and more have to be balanced to produce the right solution for the car in question. A low-power EV like a Fiat 500e is optimized to provide maximum range at the cost of output power. Its 42.0-kWh battery pack can provide just 117 hp (86 kW), but it can go 149 miles on a charge. The Corvette E-Ray, on the opposite end of the spectrum, has a small pack; just 1.1 kWh is usable. Despite this, it can regenerate more power under braking than the Fiat can put to the ground in anger. The E-Ray's battery is capacitor-like and power-dense, not energy-dense.
The AMG's hybrid system is the same way. It's a compliment to the existing combustion drivetrain, increasing both performance and efficiency. Keep in mind, the new 816 hp Mercedes in question emits just 188 g/km of CO2, which is the same as a 382 hp BMW M340i xDrive.
So while kilowatt-hours and range might be the headline figures for BEVs and PHEVs, it's far from the entire story. The world of hybrid cars especially is complicated by the realities of higher cycle life requirements and other constraints that make designing their batteries an interesting challenge. That challenge should be appreciated—it's a very interesting one—and not just dismissed as a small amount of range in cars that should always have more.

The New MG Electric Hypercar Hits 62 MPH in 1.9 Seconds,https://www.motor1.com/news/716915/mg-exe-181-concept-debut/,The concept car has an ultra-low drag coefficient of just 0.181.,2024-12-25 08:53:51,"With the 2024 Auto China show starting later this week, we're in for variety of attention-grabbing concept cars. MG will be in Beijing to showcase the EXE181 concept, an electric hypercar with a single-seat moncoque design. Sitting extremely to the ground, the striking EV looks like one of those Vision Gran Turismo cars.
The teardrop shape contributes to a remarkably low drag coefficient of only 0.181, which is better than the Volkswagen XL1's 0.199 and any other production vehicle. But some concepts were better. The 2022 Mercedes Vision EQXX concept had a Cd of just 0.18, the 2000 General Motors Precept had a drag coefficient of 0.16, and we can't forget about the 1954 Fiat Turbina with a remarkably low 0.14.
Regardless, the new MG EXE181 is a modern-day equivalent of a namesake concept from 1959. The UFO-shaped car before it supposedly had an even lower Cd of 0.12. The ""British"" brand owned by China's SAIC Motor says it's not just one of the most aerodynamic cars out there, but also among the quickest. It needs only 1.9 seconds to reach 62 mph from a standstill.
The Lucid Air Sapphire recently did it in 1.77 seconds, albeit to 60 mph rather than 62 mph and with a one-foot rollout. Last year, the Rimac Nevera took 1.74 seconds to get the job done. Elon Musk promises the new Roadster can reach 60 mph in less than a second but we're honestly finding that hard to believe.
As for top speed, MG doesn't say, but it does mention the EXE181 ""defies the land speed record."" The original concept from the late 1950s managed to reach 254.91 mph with American racing driver Phill Hill behind the wheel.
The extremely tight interior with a center-mounted seat and a racing harness is just as futuristic while reminding us of the single-seat Lamborghini Egoista. The new EXE181 has been envisioned with a yoke incorporating a large screen suggesting the car has four electric motors. Although MG is tight-lipped on other technical specifications, we can safely assume all-wheel drive and a combined output of well over 1,000 horsepower.
The chances of seeing a production version are likely slim to none since this looks more like a spectacular one-off affair to grab the headlines, which it has succeeded.

The 805-HP AMG GT63 S E Performance Is The Quickest Mercedes Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/716809/mercedes-amg-gt-63s-eperformance-debut/,The GT63 S E Performance is the quickest-accelerating production vehicle Mercedes-AMG has ever built.,2024-12-25 08:53:51,"You knew it was coming. For those who prefer their insane Mercedes-Benz performance cars wearing sleek two-door clothing, you have a new toy. The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door coupe is here, and all indications suggest it was worth the wait.
Those familiar with Mercedes-AMG know E Performance is the company's name for hybrid power. You get 805 combined horsepower in the new GT flagship, courtesy of the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 at the front and an electric motor at the back. The gas burner alone accounts for 603 hp, but arguably the more impressive number is the combined 1,047 pound-feet of torque. With everything working together, Mercedes says the AMG GT63 S E Performance reaches 60 mph in a supercar-beating 2.7 seconds. The new-generation coupe might be bigger with its extra seats, but it's officially the fastest-accelerating AMG production model of them all.
While this is technically a plug-in hybrid, efficiency is not a factor here. The battery capacity is just 6.1 kWh, and Mercedes makes no mention of electric-only range other than to say it will be announced later. Instead, the battery's focus is on performance, and to that end, Mercedes keeps it at an optimal temperature to draw the most power when needed. Charging comes through either a plug or various driver-selectable recuperation settings, including a one-pedal mode similar to an EV.
A nine-speed dual-clutch transmission routes power through Mercedes-AMG's 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system. In normal operation, the electric motor only drives the rear axle, but when slip is detected, power can be routed forward. Rear-axle steering and the AMG Active Ride Control suspension with roll stabilization are standard-issue here, as are carbon ceramic brakes. Six-piston calipers grip 16.5-inch rotors at the front, mounted behind standard-issue 20-inch wheels, while 15-inch rotors with single-piston calipers can be found out back. Optional wheels up to 21 inches are available.
Appearance-wise, you'd be hard-pressed to identify the E Performance version from the standard AMG GT63 unless you get up close. Mercedes adds special badging to the trunk lid, and there's a door hiding a charging port on the rear fascia. Unseen are changes to the active aero system, designed to optimize performance specifically for the hybrid powertrain. In the 2+2 cockpit, it's standard-issue Mercedes-AMG, which means it's not a bad place to be.
Pricing for the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door will be announced closer to its on-sale date in late 2024.

Here's The Kia EV5 GT Before You're Supposed To See It,https://www.motor1.com/news/716702/kia-ev5-gt-photos/,There are some specs to go along with the revealing images.,2024-12-25 08:53:52,"The Kia Stinger GT is dead. Long live the electric GTs. Following the EV6 GT, there's a new EV5 GT on the way. Although announced last year, it hasn't officially launched. However, revealing images have emerged in China as part of the vehicle's homologation process. The photos were published on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's website where there are also some preliminary technical specifications.
The MIIT site lists the spicy electric crossover as a full-fat EV5 GT rather than a GT-Line. The grainy images make it hard to see whether the badge says GT or GT-Line, but we're betting on the former. According to the specs sheet, it has a front electric motor with a peak output of 215 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. At the rear, the motor is good for another 98 hp and 125 lb-ft.
It's worth noting the continuous output is–as expected–considerably lower: 83 hp and 73 lb-ft at the front axle along with 64 hp and 55 lb-ft at the rear. The all-wheel-drive Kia EV5 GT weighs a hefty 4,916 pounds and rides on 20-inch wheels with 255/45 R20 tires. As for size, it’s 164 inches long, 73.8 inches wide, and 67.5 inches tall. That makes it nearly 21 inches shorter, 0.6 inches narrower, and 6.7 inches taller than the EV6 GT. The 108.2-inch wheelbase is six inches shorter than that of its bigger brother.
As a refresher, the regular EV5 was introduced last October during Kia's inaugural EV Day event in Seoul. The company is considering bringing the EV5 to North America, but a final decision has yet to be announced. It's worth noting the new electric crossover is front-wheel-drive-based rather than having a rear-biased setup as with the EV6 and other Kia/Hyundai/Genesis models riding on the E-GMP platform. It also has a 400-volt electric architecture instead of the superior 800-volt setup that enables lightning-quick charging times.
There's another high-performance electric SUV planned since it's already been over a year since Kia promised an EV9 GT. It's scheduled to come out at the beginning of 2025.

Here's Why The Toyota Camry Is Hybrid Only,https://www.motor1.com/news/716462/2025-toyota-camry-hybrid-only/,"We speak with Mark DeJongh, chief engineer for the 2025 Camry. He tells us why it’s “sedan to the core.”",2024-12-25 08:53:54,"Perhaps the most important thing about the new Toyota Camry is its hybrid drivetrain. It’s the only one available, with conventional four-cylinder and V-6 options dead for 2025. It’s a big deal, yet for Toyota, a natural step.
“It’s just the right vehicle at the right time,” Mark DeJongh, the Camry’s chief engineer, tells Motor1, “and we really think the customers are going to embrace it. The fuel economy is so great, and we knew with the new [Toyota] Hybrid System 5, we really had an opportunity to tune that drivetrain and get it to where it could be great.”
THS 5 is, naturally, the fifth generation of the Toyota Hybrid System that debuted with the Prius back in 1997. To give a very basic overview, THS centers around two electric motor-generator units (MGUs). MGU1 works as a starter for the engine and a generator for the battery; MGU2 is a larger motor that can drive the wheels either with or without the engine. In all-wheel drive Camrys, these are augmented by an additional electric motor that drives the rear wheels.
Whereas the Prius uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Camry uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder evolved from the previous Camry hybrid. It now makes 184 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque. DeJongh talks a lot about finding efficiencies wherever possible, and for the engine, that resulted in switching from 0W-16 oil to an astonishingly light 0W-8. The Camry also has a slightly smaller lithium-ion battery with just 1.0 kWh of capacity, but it now delivers more power than before. System output for the new Camry is 225 hp. The all-wheel drive Camry develops 232 hp.
The most-efficient model, the LE FWD, sitting on its 16-inch wheels, manages 51 mpg combined. Whereas the least efficient, the XSE AWD returns 44 mpg. It’s a figure we easily beat on our drive route.
DeJongh says that, “[O]nce we decided to go 100-percent hybrid, we almost forgot we were going 100-percent hybrid. It just didn’t become a thing anymore.”
It speaks to where Toyota and its customers are. The Japanese giant didn’t go all-in on EVs, instead pushing hybrid models, and it came at the right time. As backlash to EVs grows, so too does consumer interest in hybrids. Going hybrid is a big step, especially for an important model like the Camry, which is still Toyota’s second-most popular model in the U.S.
Beyond the hybrid system, the new Camry is all about iterative updates.
“It’s Toyota, right?” DeJongh says, “Kaizen, kaizen, kaizen, kaizen. Little improvement, little improvement, little improvement.”
There are naturally the expected updates to infotainment and driver-assist systems, but DeJongh and his team worked on improving the ride and handling of the SE and XSE models, and steering and brake-pedal feel across the lineup.
“We do kind of a message when we start, a message out to the engineers and everybody’s who’s going to be working on it,” DeJongh says. “Part of my message was ‘SUVs have taken the place that used to belong to sedans, but we are going to stay true to being a sedan.’ People who go to SUV's, we're not trying to get them back... we're not chasing them; we’re making a true sedan. Actually, our motto was ‘sedan to the core.’”
The idea was to simply make a better Camry. Toyota knows well what defines this sedan, and it’s not deviating from the formula.
“That's a double-edged sword,” DeJohngh tells us. “As an engineer, or somebody who develops cars, you want to do something fun and way out there, but like I said, ‘sedan to the core.’ We’re following what a Camry is and making it much better.”

The New BMW i4 Arrives Next Week,https://www.motor1.com/news/716539/2025-bmw-i4-debut-date/,The BMW Group will bring the new i4 and Mini Aceman to the Auto China show.,2024-12-25 08:53:54,"With BMW offering such a vast lineup, there's always a new model around the corner. After introducing the updated 4 Series Coupe and Convertible in late January, the i4 will break cover next week. The electric 4er is going to celebrate its world premiere in Beijing at Auto China alongside the Mini Aceman.
BMW only mentions the i4, without the 4 Series Gran Coupe upon which the EV is based. It's unclear whether the model with combustion engines will be there as well. Spy shots of the zero-emission model have revealed redesigned headlights with boomerang-shaped elements inherited from the recently updated two-door 4 Series models. The front bumper will also adopt a fresh, albeit busy look.
It's too soon to say whether the 2025 BMW i4 is getting those cool laser taillights we saw on the 4 Series Coupe/Convertible. The M4 CSL had them first a couple of years ago, and so did the ultra-exclusive 3.0 CSL. They're now trickling down to the lesser 4 Series/M4 models.
Inside, the flat-bottomed steering wheel we saw on the ICE-powered, two-door models could come to the i4 as well. In addition, BMW is likely to transition the EV to its latest infotainment system, the iDrive 8.5. We're also expecting slightly revised central air vents surrounded by contour ambient lighting–as seen on the 2025 4 Series Coupe/Convertible.
Joining the i4 in China will be the Aceman, Mini's first electric-only model. Positioned below the Countryman, the new subcompact crossover is going to be built locally by Spotlight Automotive. It’s a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group and Great Wall Motor. The electric three-door hatch is also made there at a new factory in Zhangjiagang, China. The two EVs will also be assembled at home in Oxford, UK from 2026.
Auto China 2024 starts April 25 with the first press day. However, the BMW Group Night event is scheduled a day before, on April 24.

Jeep's Electric SUVs Could Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/716367/jeep-wagoneer-s-recon-gasoline-engines/,The Wagoneer S and Recon EVs could be joined by ICE models to bolster sales.,2024-12-25 08:53:56,"From 973,227 vehicles sold in 2018 to 643,000 units in 2023–that's quite the downfall for Jeep. It's suffered five consecutive years of decline. Axing the affordable Renegade and Cherokee certainly didn't help, but new CEO Antonio Filosa has a plan. The Wagoneer S and Recon are coming as electric SUVs. In addition, gasoline versions are apparently being considered as well.
Speaking with Automotive News, Jeep's boss admitted the two future electric SUVs might be joined by conventionally powered derivatives. This would be possible thanks to the STLA Large platform that has already underpinned the new Dodge Charger. It's an EV-centric architecture that can accommodate ICEs as well. The next-generation Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio are getting this hardware, too.
Jeep's head honcho told Automotive News that should opportunities arise for ICE versions, ""we need to grab them or somebody else will."" Since the EV market seems to be cooling down, selling these two models with gas engines at a presumably lower price seems like a no-brainer. It would make sense especially considering the company’s new goal is to achieve one million annual sales in the United States.
Even with gas derivatives of the Wagoneer S and Recon, hitting 1M still seems like an overly ambitious goal at this point. Cheaper vehicles to indirectly replace the Renegade and Cherokee would help bolster volume. Europe's Jeep Avenger might be a solution in the US but it wasn't mentioned during the interview.
Meanwhile, the 600-horsepower Wagoneer S is scheduled to go on sale in the third quarter of the year for a short 2024MY run. With a 0 to 60 mph in less than three and a half seconds, it'll be Jeep quickest vehicle ever. It's getting about 400 miles of range and all-wheel drive with a dual-motor setup. The firm's boss says the large electric SUV can lure in Tesla buyers who ""want something more sophisticated.""
The smaller Recon is coming by year's end and will have its first full year on sale in 2025. Other than the STLA Large platform, technical specifications have not been disclosed, but it should be smaller than the Wagoneer S. Filosa projects Wrangler customers interested in electrified off-roaders will want the Recon.

The 2025 Audi RS E-Tron GT Performance Will Be A New Flagship,https://www.motor1.com/news/716219/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-performance/,Think Porsche Taycan Turbo S but not as hardcore.,2024-12-25 08:53:57,"Hot on the heels of the 2025 Porsche Taycan's debut, Audi is previewing its version of the updated electric sedan. Much like there's now a Taycan Turbo GT, the Four Rings are putting the finishing touches on a new flagship. It's called the RS E-Tron GT Performance to echo gasoline models such as the RS6 and RS7 Performance versions.
It won’t be as hardcore as the model from Zuffenhausen, much like the current RS E-Tron GT isn't as intense as the Taycan Turbo S. Nevertheless, there will be a power boost over the 637 hp and 612 lb-ft offered by the outgoing range-topper. Audi remains coy on details (this is a teaser after all) but it's sharing images of a camouflaged car with ceramic brakes lurking from behind those aero wheels.
The revamped front and rear motors are unlikely to match the 938-hp grunt of the Taycan Turbo S, let alone the immense 1,019 hp of the fierce Turbo GT. We do know Audi's engineers have made changes not just to the powertrain but also to the battery pack for longer range. For reference, the new Taycan with the Performance Battery Plus has a usable energy content of 98.6 kWh while the base model gets an 83.6-kWh net battery pack.
Charging speed is also up, which isn't a surprise considering the latest Taycan can now take 320 kW instead of 270 kW. Elsewhere, Audi has developed a new suspension system with four individually active dual-valve dampers. This quicker-reacting hardware will be adapted from the new Porsche Panamera. In the Audi, the suspension is tuned for greater comfort compared to the sharper Taycan.
Audi intends to unveil the 2025 E-Tron GT later this year. There will be updates across the range since the lesser models positioned below the RS and RS Performance will be tweaked as well.

Mercedes Stops Testing EQS with 1.0-Liter Range-Extending Engine: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/716214/mercedes-eqs-range-extender-test-stopped/,The tiny two-cylinder gasoline engine served as a range extender.,2024-12-25 08:53:58,"The EQS is built on a dedicated electric car platform, but Mercedes has been toying around with the idea of throwing in a gas engine. Not to drive the wheels but as a generator to juice up the battery on the fly. A new report claims testing of a prototype has been done with a tiny 1.0-liter turbocharged range extender. However, these trials have allegedly been suspended.
Autocar cites a Mercedes insider claiming the German luxury brand is no longer pursuing range-extending EVs. It's deemed as a ""transitional technology"" that’s expensive to produce and brings only minimal benefits. The EQS allegedly had a two-cylinder version of the ""M254"" four-pot engine with an exhaust system mounted at the front of the car. Power came from a rear-mounted electric motor with 268 hp, drawing its energy from a lithium-ion battery pack installed in the floor.
The front-mounted ICE likely wouldn't have hindered practicality since the EQS doesn't have a frunk anyway. However, adding a combustion engine and a small fuel tank would've added weight to an already heavy car. An EQS 450+ tips the scales at 5,597 pounds while the AMG variant weighs 5,952 pounds.
Pricing would've been another issue. Logic tells us a range-extending EQS would've been more expensive given the extra hardware. The base model already costs six figures, starting at $104,400 and rising to $147,550, before options and the destination charge.
We've reached out to Mercedes for a comment, and we will update this story once we hear back. In the meantime, it's worth noting the company inked a deal with Geely in late 2020 to work on hybrid powertrains. While range-extenders weren't specified, we do know that China's automotive juggernaut has this type of technology in its portfolio. The partnership stipulated that Geely-owned Volvo would also use those engines.
The company carrying the fabled three-pointed star is now channeling its efforts toward regular battery-powered EVs. The recently launched 2025 EQS is already a good cure for range anxiety since the enlarged battery (from 108.4 to 118 kWh) enables a maximum WLTP range of 511 miles.
EPA has not rated the revised model, but the old one did up to 352 miles on a single charge. WLTP is generally more optimistic than EPA, so don't expect America's EQS to have the same high rating as the equivalent European model.

Hyundai's New EVs Were Caught Testing in the US,https://www.motor1.com/news/716061/hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt-video/,The Ioniq 5 XRT and Ioniq 9 three-row should debut later this year.,2024-12-25 08:54:00,"Hyundai’s electric onslaught is in full swing. With the Ioniq 5 recently getting a nip and tuck, the Korean brand is extending its lineup with a rugged-looking XRT trim. It's been spotted in the United States where the larger Ioniq 9 is under final testing as well. The latter is a three-row SUV, which apparently won't be called Ioniq 7 as originally intended.
The Ioniq 5 won't be Hyundai's first model to get the XRT treatment, but the trim level will make its debut on an EV. Already available for Santa Cruz, Tucson, Santa Fe, and Palisade, the XRT is essentially an appearance package. Don't expect real off-road upgrades since it'll mostly be about black accents, new wheels, and possibly those chunky tires as well. We wouldn't hold our breath for a lifted suspension or any other mechanical upgrades for that matter.
The Ioniq 5 should arrive for the 2025 model year alongside the already available high-performance N model. Logic tells us the US-spec variant will inherit the updates we saw on the global model, which also spawned an all-show-without-extra-go N Line. Hyundai tweaked the bumpers and grille, along with adding a rear wiper and a few more buttons inside.
The Ioniq 9 will essentially be Hyundai’s equivalent of the Kia EV9, with room for six passengers. Speaking of how many people it can seat, the Concept Seven introduced in November 2021 was a preview of the brand’s biggest electric vehicle to date. The name change will leave room for a smaller Ioniq 7 that could arrive further down the line.
While the concept (pictured below) did away with B pillars, the subsequent production model will add them back. In addition, the sliding rear doors will make way for a conventional setup. The most striking angle of the Concept Seven was its rear with a massive glass tailgate but that seems to be going away as well. The cutout in the camouflage for the license plate indicates the glass no longer extends all the way down.
How big is it? Well, the Kia EV9 stretches 197.2 inches long. Hyundai didn't reveal the Concept Seven's overall length, but it did say it had a massive wheelbase of 126 inches. That's a full four inches longer than the distance between the EV9's axles. It should translate into an even more spacious cabin, especially for third-row occupants. Looking at the prototype's profile, we notice the roofline gently slopes toward the rear whereas on the Kia it’s pretty much flat. The arched-back silhouette could eat into headroom and cargo volume.
Both the Ioniq 5 XRT and Ioniq 9 are expected to premiere later this year. Automotive News reports US sales of the three-row SUV won't start until mid-2025.

Rivian R1X: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/715808/rivian-r1x-debut-horsepower-details/,Rivian could have a real Raptor fighter in the new R1X.,2024-12-25 08:54:01,"Rivian recently released two new models: The R2 and the R3. Part of that launch included the surprise debut of the automaker's first performance EV, the R3X. It's essentially a rugged version of the R3, with a slight suspension lift, knobby tires, and a few orange accents.
But that ""X"" moniker could make its way to other models, including the R1 range. A recent trademark filing suggests more jacked-up Rivians are in the works. The company filed for the R1X trademark in 2021, but wasn't published until late last year. Companies trademark names they'll never use all the time, but now that Rivian has the R3X, the R1X seems like a genuine possibility.
Although there aren't specifics on exactly how capable the Rivian R1X could be, we expect it to be able to keep up with the likes of the GMC Hummer EV on the trail, and maybe even the Ford F-150 Raptor. Here's what we know.
All rugged performance models need the right look, naturally. The R1X would have unique fascias and new bumper treatments to improve its off-road capability. Rivian might have already teased what such a model could look like with its bedside storage patent.
The Rivian shown in the filing has an aggressive new face, rugged rockers, and a chunkier bumper that would significantly improve its approach angle. The patent fails to show most of the truck's rear, but we expect a similarly upgraded bumper at the back for all-around capability.
The R3X also debuted with orange accents on the mirror caps, tow hooks, and bumpers, and a teal exterior, which could be hallmarks of Rivian's performance EVs and find their way onto the R1X. The accent color should also carry over to the cabin. The new model could also include the unique bedside storage system Rivian patented last year.
Our rendering artist brought the rugged R1X to life using cues from the R3X and the original patent images.
The R1S SUV and R1T pickup both have dual- and quad-motor setups, but the smaller R3X debuted with a tri-motor layout. That could be a limitation of the R3's smaller size, but Rivian didn't provide any details about the R3X's powertrain configuration.
It's unclear whether that tri-motor configuration could carry over to the larger R1, but a quad-motor setup seems like the likeliest option for a rugged R1X. If Rivian wants it to go off-road, a motor at each wheel with the right software would provide the greatest precision and control.
Rumors say a future performance R1 could have more than 1,000 horsepower. That would make sense given that the R1T has up to 835 hp on the Performance trim.
If the R1X is part of a new trim family, it will probably take after the R3X. It'll likely get all the required hardware for tackling the trails—a raised ride height, chunkier tires wrapped around bigger wheels, and thicker cladding along the bottom.
That means the electric pickup will be even more capable on the trail. The current R1T already has a decent approach angle of 35.5 degrees and a departure angle 26.4 degrees, with the ability to wade water of up to 43.1 inches. All of those numbers should improve with the X upgrades.
The Rivian R1T starts at $71,700, but costs $90,800 with the dual-motor setup and the largest Max battery. The R1S is even more expensive at $76,700 to start, and $95,800 for the dual-motor Max model.
A high-performance version like the R1X would easily push past the $100,000 mark. Assuming the quad-motor layout comes standard—which costs $88,800 on the R1T—the off-road upgrades and updated interior would make this a pretty pricey proposition.
But that's not outrageous for this type of vehicle. The GMC Hummer EV pickup starts at $99,340 for 2024 and the gas-powered Ford F-150 Raptor is $80,325 before options.
Rivian has quite a lot on its plate as it prepares to launch the R2 and, eventually, the R3. The R2 is smaller and more affordable than the R1S, and should be Rivian’s first mainstream model. It goes on sale in 2026.
But there are rumors that Rivian could launch an updated R1 series sometime this year. If that happens, it would be an opportune time to expand the R1 lineup with an X off-road variant. While Rivian will allegedly focus on improving the efficiency of its core lineup, a high-performance model with 1,000 horsepower is rumored in 2024, which could very well be the R1X.

My Quad-Motor Electric Go-Kart Finally Works,https://www.motor1.com/features/715524/quad-motor-electric-go-kart/,We’re gonna need a better battery.,2024-12-25 08:54:03,"Electric go-karts aren’t uncommon, but I’ve personally never seen a go-kart with an electric motor on each wheel. If you read the last edition of this series, you’ll know my attempt at cheap kart suspension didn’t work. This time, I fix that. I also get this machine moving for the first time under its own power. Spoiler alert: It’s a monster.
I fixed the suspension by getting rid of it. Once again Oshcut, this project’s sponsor, came to the rescue. I modeled up some tubes in CAD which effectively kept the wheels in their original position but mounted them directly to the chassis. I uploaded the files to their site, selected the material, and ordered them. A few days later they were at my doorstep, ready to be installed on the kart. The biggest pain of the entire process was removing the old suspension. Who designed that junk anyway?
The fact that Oshcut offers lasered tubes now is a huge deal. They’re the only company that does it among the handful of businesses with instant-quoted laser-cut/CNC parts. I used laser-cut tubes on the Motocompacto project, and now this one. It will not be the last time you see them. They’re truly a game-changer.
Anyway, my parts were exactly as I specified in CAD, so I installed them with ease. The next thing for me to do was assemble the new front steering system. As you saw last time, my old steering was too weak. This time I doubled the thickness of the tie rods and added some beef to the actual uprights and their mounting positions as well. It seems very strong now, probably more rigid than it needs to be. These bent sheet metal parts are also from Oshcut. Some of them even have threads on them, which you can specify during the upload process on their site.
Finally, I bolted the motors up. The rears went on without much fuss. The fronts were different. I wanted to use a 2-by-3-inch aluminum tube for the rear of this kart because the stub axles off the hub motors would be well supported. It’s also cheaper on Oshcut to get four of the same part, so I used identical tubes on the front. Because of the extra width of the steering system, the front axle is wider than the rear axle. I could accommodate for this with another set of tubes on the back but I just don’t think it’s worth the hassle. This thing is already big enough.
Now it’s time to discuss the electric drivetrain, which is the cool part.
All power electronics have ratings. They can take X amount of power continuously for the rest of time, or Y amount of power for a shorter time. Y is known as the burst rating. It’s a high level of output that cannot be sustained forever but will make you smile. Battery and inverter manufacturers will often state a burst rating, but motor manufacturers will not, for whatever reason.
My hub motors are each rated for 2.5 kilowatts of continuous output. That’s 3.35 horsepower; 52 amps at 48 volts. The voltage will not change considerably as I run the kart, going down a little when I ask for a lot of power–a phenomenon known as voltage sag–and gradually as the pack discharges. Adjusting the current is where the magic happens.
In my experience, hub motors can take about twice their rated current for a short run. Do the math and with four motors that means a potential peak of 20 kW, or 26.8 hp. That’s about as much as a Citroen 2CV.
You run into problems when you desire this much power, though. Even my 2-kilowatt-hour module swiped from an Audi Q5 PHEV cannot provide the 400 amps of current necessary to reach the peak output of this quad motor setup. In fact, it probably can’t even provide the 200 amps necessary to get the peak power out of a rear-wheel-drive setup, which is how I have the kart configured now.
Even without all of the power possible, this thing is fast, though. I’m currently limited to doing short pulls in my driveway, but I can already tell, not only how much torque it has, but also how fast it wants to go. Each motor is only set to 60A and it’s already quick. I really need to find somewhere to stretch this thing’s legs. I can tell the kingpin angle cooked into the steering gives it some semblance of feel, sort of like a car. The entire thing just feels complex, powerful, and massive.
Indeed, it weighs 177 pounds according to my heavy-duty postal scale. Each motor weighs 12.5 pounds for a total of 50 pounds. The battery weighs roughly 30 pounds, which means more than half of the kart’s weight is just drivetrain. The chassis could definitely be lighter—I had to use T-slot extrusions for the main rails because I designed it before Oshcut offered tube cutting. But once there’s a driver on this thing, it wouldn’t save a huge percentage.
Despite this excessive weight, the entire driving experience is still nothing short of thrilling. For the first time I’ve created a vehicle that’s similar in weight to me, and it’s tough to wrap my head around the physics of something like that. The complexity of everything going on is tantalizing. This is not a car, not even close, but even without suspension, I get car-like cues from it. It’s very satisfying.
All of this is a big reason why I don’t want to add more battery to solve my lack of power. I like the current state of the thing’s dynamics and I don’t want additional weight. I’m instead going to change chemistries. That will be the topic of the next edition of this series: Unlocking all of the power of the RWD configuration. Then, once I can put together the AWD battery, we’ll really be entering the danger zone.

Porsche's Skunkworks Built the Taycan Turbo GT,https://www.motor1.com/news/715238/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-skunkworks-development/,Only a handful at Porsche knew about this car’s development. We learned what makes it remarkable.,2024-12-25 08:54:04,"A few years ago, Stefan Weckbach, then the chief engineer for the Porsche Taycan, built a weird prototype.
""He came up to me with this normal-looking Taycan with two bucket seats and more power,” Porsche test driver Lars Kern told Motor1 at the car’s Spain launch. ""He was like ‘Can you drive it?’ I was looking at the tires and they were Pirelli Corsas from the Panamera. I was like ‘Okay, seems good,’ And we just drove around in Weissach. There wasn’t even a number plate on it and the thing was flying.”
Kern approved. Weckbach’s successor, Kevin Giek, revived it some time later. The brief was essentially to build the ultimate EV, and no idea was too silly. It was to be a real skunkworks effort. The development team was small, and they answered only to Giek and Porsche’s board—no middle-management, no complex approvals process, almost unprecedented freedom to build.
The Turbo GT features a number of tweaks compared to the Taycan Turbo S. A new silicon-carbide inverter for the rear motor boosts total output to 1,092 horsepower when using launch control (1,019 hp with Attack Mode enabled, and 777 hp at all other times). The engineers saved a bit of weight by ditching luxuries like a power-opening charge door and soft-close passenger doors.
In the case of the Weissach-Package car, Porsche axed back seats entirely. Both the standard and Weissach Package car get a unique aero treatment, with the latter gaining a fixed rear wing. There’s unique 21-inch forged wheels, and the standard tires are Pirelli’s new P-Zero R, while the ultra-grippy Trofeo RS is optional. Also standard is Porsche Active Ride, the automaker’s brilliant active-suspension system, which all but eliminates pitch, roll, and dive (the system doesn’t compensate for tire deflection).
Extreme measures like the rear-seat delete or the addition of bespoke Trofeo RS tires wouldn’t happen if the Turbo GT was developed like a normal Porsche model.
“It’s a little bit crazy,” says Christian Müller, the Turbo GT’s chief engineer. “At the beginning, we were talking about ‘Okay, let’s take out this, and this, and this, and this. But it felt good to go in a radical way….you have to go one step further than the others.”
“It was all the little ideas and little tweaks which made the cars so special,” Kern tells us. “I mean everybody was allowed to bring up an idea and it all went through Christian to Kevin, and he was like ‘Yeah. Whatever makes this faster, we’ve got to fuckin’ do it.’”
Müller says that the Turbo GT isn’t simply a response to Tesla showing up at the Nürburgring—a Model S Plaid with the optional Track Package ran a 7:25.231 in 2023, besting the Taycan Turbo S’s 7:33.35 in 2021. But Müller conceded the Nordschleife is like Porsche’s “living room.” The company takes Nürburgring lap times very seriously, so surely it wanted to take the crown from Tesla. And indeed, with Kern’s 7:07.55, the Turbo GT is not only the fastest electric sedan at the Nürburgring, but the fastest sedan period. It’s just two-ish seconds slower than the fastest EV to ever lap the track, the Rimac Nevera hypercar.
What’s perhaps most remarkable is that for all its speed, the Turbo GT is approachable and friendly. Fun, even. In other words, not just a lap-time machine.
“It’s not just one thing… we always try to get a good package that makes the car fast and rounded,” Kern said. “You’re not buying the battery or the suspension,” he added. “You’re buying the whole car. You don’t care how we did it, you just want it to be done as well as possible.”

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Will Race at Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/715558/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-pikes-peak/,The hot EV will lose the rear seats in exchange for a roll cage.,2024-12-25 08:54:05,"Hyundai wants to show off the Ioniq 5 N's performance chops by bringing four examples of the hot EV to this year's Pikes Peak. The 102th running of the hill climb event takes place June 23 and will feature two production-spec vehicles along with a couple of modified cars. The standard ones won't be truly stock either since some tweaks will be made inside.
Going after the electric production SUV/crossover record, the two Ioniq 5 Ns won't have rear seats. Not because Hyundai wants to make the vehicles lighter but safer by adding a roll cage in the back. In addition, the driver's seat is replaced by a Recaro Pro Racer SPA Hans seat with a six-point Sabelt racing harness compatible with HANS (head and neck support). In case something goes awry, there's going to be a fire suppression system.
Other than these modifications, the Ioniq 5 N will be completely stock. It'll carry over the dual-motor setup from the road-going model, complete with up to 641 horsepower when overboost is active. In regular mode, the total system output is still a massive 601 hp. Hyundai touts a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.25 seconds with launch control and the extra temporary power. Flat out, top speed is electronically capped at 162 mph.
Eleven-time PPIHC winner Paul Dallenbach will hunt for records in one of the two ""stock"" Ioniq 5 Ns. The other one will be driven by rookie Ron Zaras, a former Hoonigan executive. As for the two modified vehicles, these will be piloted by WRC driver Dani Sordo and four-time overall winner and King of the Mountain title holder at Pikes Peak Robin Shute. The two will perform a test ahead of the grueling 24 Hours of Nürburgring set for May 30.
Hyundai is already evaluating the Ioniq 5 N at Pikes Peak, but the speedy EV will adopt an N livery instead of this red finish for the actual race in Colorado. The four vehicles are going to tackle the 12.42-mile course with no fewer than 156 turns. All drivers will go through an elevation gain of 4,725 feet, crossing the finish line at 14,115 feet above sea level.
The outright record at Pikes Peak belongs to Romain Dumas in the Volkswagen I.D. R with a time of 7 minutes and 57.148 seconds established in 2018. It's safe to assume the Ioniq 5 N won't get anywhere close since the VW was a purpose-built electric race car.

The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Demolishes the Track,https://www.motor1.com/reviews/715239/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-review/,"We lapped Porsche’s 1,000-plus-horsepower EV. It’s a friendly beast.",2024-12-25 08:54:07,"I'm too narrow into Circuto Monteblanco's turn two. Lars Kern, Porsche’s factory development-driver ace in the car leading me around the track, pulls away. No matter, though. Tug at the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT’s right-hand steering-wheel paddle and you unlock Attack Mode, which gives you 1,019 horsepower for 10 seconds. Get on throttle quickly, and the car scrambles out of the corner with authority, vaporizing my mistake.
It’s a monster.
The Turbo GT is the product of ""what if?"" Specifically, ""What if we made a track car out of an electric sedan?"" A genuine skunkworks project, a small team within Porsche developed the car. The team answered only to the board, not middle management. The quickest four-door in the world—electric or not—resulted.
We turned a handful of laps at Circuito Monteblanco outside Seville, Spain, on the launch for the recently facelifted Taycan. It was eye opening.
Based on the Turbo S, the Turbo GT gets a new silicon-carbide inverter for the rear motor that pushes total power output up to 1,019 hp during launch control and for 10 seconds in what Porsche calls “Attack Mode,” and in all other situations, you get 777 hp.
That power pairs to revised aerodynamics including a fixed rear wing on the Turbo GT model, wider wheels and tires, a specific tune for the standard active-suspension system, and some weight-savings measures. Nothing too extreme, well maybe except for the rear-seat delete with the Weissach Package. Even the power figure, though enormous, isn’t that much greater than the Turbo S’s. But these tweaks adds up to a very different electric sport sedan.
Even knowing chassis electronics have made ultra-high-horsepower cars so approachable, the Taycan Turbo GT intimidates. It’s still a 1,000-plus-horsepower car that weighs close to 5,000 pounds in its lightest form. I didn’t pay much attention in physics, but I do know that force is equal to mass times acceleration, and this has a lot of M and A.
Yet, the Turbo GT is shockingly approachable. For something designed to set crazy fast lap times, it’s incredibly welcoming and talkative. You quickly get a sense of the grip level available, which is gargantuan. The Turbo GT comes with the new Pirelli P-Zero R tires standard, and while these tires manage the huge power and weight well, the optional Trofeo RS really make the car come alive. Turn-in grip is absurd. You turn the wheel and think you’re at the limit, but there’s always more available. And breathe off the throttle mid corner and the car rotates beautifully. It’s so responsive.
On either tire, the Turbo GT feels hundreds, if not a thousand pounds lighter than it is. The standard Porsche Active Ride suspension system is fully active, meaning it can put force into the body via hydraulic motor-pump units connected to each damper. The system runs off the Taycan’s 800-volt battery and is capable of generating enormous force (2,248 pounds) in a very short amount of time. As a result, the Turbo GT has virtually no roll, pitch, or dive. (It doesn’t compensate for tire deflection, so the car does move around, but the body sits perfectly level.)
Clever calibration means this feels more natural than you’d expect, but Active Ride generates immense grip by controlling the loads independently at each corner. The damping is basically perfect, too. Monteblanco has a couple tall curbs and big rumble strips. You can huck a Turbo GT over them at silly speeds and the car just shrugs it off.
If a car is just a battle between horsepower and grip, this battle is evenly matched. Which is astonishing. In the slow corners and chicanes, the Turbo GT rockets forward, with just a hint of how hard the car is working to generate traction; in the high-speed stuff, it feels absolutely stable. Between the massive mechanical and aero grip—the Turbo GT Weissach Package generates a maximum of 485 lbs at its 190-mph top speed—the car feels planted at all times.
Monteblanco’s best corner is a fast uphill right with a compression at the bottom. You need a light brake or a lift, and the corner puts so much load through the car. The Turbo GT takes it all no problem. It’s astonishing.
The Turbo GT excels at stopping too, especially when you consider the fact that it’s constantly adjusting the balance of regenerative and friction braking, and dealing with incredible speed and weight.
Oh yeah, speed. Porsche had us stop along the front straight and launch the Turbo GT. From there, Kern says if you ran the full length of the straight, you’d probably be doing around 175 mph braking into turn one. Too fast for an event like this. Yet even stopping more than halfway down the straight and using launch control, you still hit around 120 mph before you have to pull the chute.
Launching the Turbo GT is genuinely disorienting. Porsche says 0-60 mph in 2.1 seconds for the Weissach Pack car, and the first time I did it, my vision went blurry for an alarming amount of time. It takes a little over six seconds to get to 124 mph, which is about as long as it’d take me to get to 60 in my Volkswagen GTI if I decided that I no longer wanted a functioning clutch.
The acceleration and speed are party tricks, but the Turbo GT is much more. It feels entirely at home on a track. The way it generates grip recalls the best stuff I’ve ever driven on a circuit, and it still manages to feel engaging.
“For us as race car drivers, it’s not a negative if the car drives well,” Kern says. “It’s as easy as that. We like a comfortable car as well, a car that’s easy to drive at the limit.”
Downsides? The cool bucket seats you see here aren’t available in America. They’re a little silly in a car like this, but they offer more feedback through the seat of the pants, and, well, the whole car is a little silly, right?
I think the target audience for this is small, though. A $230,000 four-door EV track car is a very specific niche, but I suppose there are always people who want the best version of a thing. And while we didn’t get to drive the Turbo GT on the road, the flexibility of the active suspension should mean it’s no more difficult as an everyday proposition than any other Taycan. Unless you delete the rear seats.

The Electric Mercedes G-Class Is Called G580 With EQ Technology,https://www.motor1.com/news/715396/mercedes-g580-eq-technology/,It debuts at Auto China this month together with several other premieres.,2024-12-25 08:54:08,"At long last, the electric Mercedes-Benz G-Class finally has a name. Contrary to reports indicating the off-roader would be the first model to drop the EQ branding, the two letters are sticking around. But rather than being called EQG like the concept, the production version will be known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" when it debuts this month at Auto China in Beijing.
Since it's called the ""G580,"" we can safely assume that it has more power than the G550. For the 2025 model year, the regular G-Class loses its V-8 in favor of a mild-hybrid, inline-six engine that makes 443 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. We reckon the electric G is not going to outpunch the AMG G63, which keeps the V-8 packing 577 hp and 627 lb-ft.
The electric G-Class is expected to have four motors—one at each wheel—and a battery capacity estimated at 100.0-kilowatt-hours. That should give it a range of over 200 miles, which isn’t ideal, but not surprising since it'll be a heavy SUV. An optional high-density battery pack benefitting from silicon anode chemistry is due in 2025. We also know it'll have 32-degree approach and 35-degree departure angles, along with 9.8 inches of ground clearance.
The G580 with EQ Technology won't be the first quad-motor EV from Mercedes since that title goes to the SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012. It's going to need all the power it can get considering G brand boss Emmerich Schiller has said it'll weigh less than 7,716 pounds.
An updated EQS will also attend the 2024 Auto China where the luxury brand intends to unveil (takes a deep breath) the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance with a plug-in hybrid V-8 setup. Without going into details, the three-pointed star mentions new show premieres from Maybach and the E-Class lineup will be there as well.
We'll first see the GT63 S E Performance on April 20 during the AMG Brand Night Event in Shanghai during the Chinese F1 weekend while the electric G premieres on April 24. Auto China starts April 25 with the first press day.

Watch Mercedes Drift The Electric G-Class on a Frozen Lake,https://www.motor1.com/news/715123/watch-mercedes-drift-electric-g-class/,We learn a few details about its off-road capability in the process.,2024-12-25 08:54:09,"Mercedes-Benz promises the forthcoming EQG—also known as the electric G-Class—is a proper off-roader. There's little reason to doubt the claim given that it looks almost exactly like the ICE model. With each wheel getting its own motor, the electric version could be more capable, with the ability to pull off stationary tank turns. Those individual motors are also good for getting comfortably sideways should you come upon a frozen lake in Sweden.
In this new video from Mercedes-Benz, CEO Ola Källenius journeyed to his home country for an electric G evaluation, demonstrating the G-Class's capabilities at a winter testing center set up by the company. There, he tackles a slalom and skidpad, where the SUV seems composed, despite all the snow and ice.
The real action comes on the skidpad, where Källenius explains how the individual motors can vector the EQG to keep it under control when slip is detected. Even when goading it into significant oversteer, things appear calm in the cockpit. After an acceleration test on ice (which Mercedes says takes ""just a few seconds"") Källenius jumps into more sideways fun. It's unclear if stability systems are adjusted or even disabled for this portion of the video, but the big G has no problem sustaining plenty of opposite lock.
The video concludes with a short trail ride off the lake, where we get a few technical teasers. The electric G-Class has a 32-degree approach angle and a 35-degree departure angle, slightly better than the current model. There's 9.8 inches of ground clearance too, also a few tenths better versus the ICE version.
It's been a minute since Mercedes first floated the electric G-Class with the EQG concept. Thankfully the production model will debut this year, though a specific timeframe hasn't been shared. Until then, expect a few more teasers leading up to the official reveal.

Porsche Working on Next-Generation Taycan with Greater Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/715027/porsche-working-second-generation-taycan/,Solid-state batteries might not be ready in time for the second-gen model.,2024-12-25 08:54:10,"There's no such thing as pausing development. Although it's been only a couple of months since Porsche updated the Taycan, work is already underway on the second-generation model. Despite giving the current sports EV substantial tweaks for its mid-cycle revision, more upgrades are planned for the next iteration.
The Taycan Manager of Charging and Energy Systems, Sarah Razavi, confirmed in an interview with Australian magazine CarSales that a new Taycan is already being developed. She admitted the J1 platform that also underpins the Audi E-Tron GT has been pushed to the maximum and that Porsche needs to come up with something else. Although not specified, perhaps the next-gen car will switch to the already announced SSP Sport platform that will serve as the basis for a large three-row electric SUV.
""Next generation? Yes, obviously, once we publish one model, we already [start] work on the next one, so we are currently creating ideas [and asking] what should we improve with the next generation. I think we did a great job to really push and squeeze every bit out of the current platform. We're probably going to see an evolution of the platform.""
Razavi admitted the J1 architecture ""definitely has some limitations"" and that the goal for a follow-up to today's Taycan will be to achieve greater range. Meanwhile, the revised model introduced in February promises up to 421 miles of WLTP range, a jump of 109 miles or 35 percent. EPA figures are not out yet. Asked if solid-state batteries are planned, Taycan product specialist Mayk Wienkötter suggested the technology might not be ready in time:
""We've been working on it, of course, but giving a timeframe when it's ready? It's way too early, too early [to confirm]. It's not ready in one or two years. It's coming but it will take time.""
Porsche could easily cram in a bigger battery but that increases the weight of an already heavy EV. Razavi mentioned that the engineers need to ""find the sweet spot"" so as not to overburden the Taycan but also avoid giving owners range anxiety.
With a second-generation Taycan confirmed, you're probably wondering where does that leave the Panamera. An Autocar report from September 2022 alleged the latter will evolve into a larger EV positioned above the Taycan while using the same SSP Sport platform. It's too soon to know for sure but an electric Panamera might not necessarily spell the end of the gasoline model.
After all, the new Macan EV will peacefully coexist with the ICE model for several years, and so will the electric and gas Boxster and Cayman sports cars. That said, the first-gen crossover and the current 718 models have been phased out in the European Union due to stricter cybersecurity regulations.

Give Performance EVs A Chance,https://www.motor1.com/features/714562/give-performance-evs-a-chance/,"Who knows, you might like 'em.",2024-12-25 08:54:12,"I see you, Instagram commenters. Whenever I read something on a Motor1 post like, ""Abomination,"" and ""Nobody wants this,"" it makes me smirk—especially when we're talking about the quickest and most powerful Porsche ever built. My favorite line: ""Even if vegan cars have 2,000 horsepower they are still trash."" Chef's kiss.
It's fair to be skeptical of electric vehicles, especially since the push for mass electrification has dragged on for years. And most certainly, those are fair criticisms to lob at appliances like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Nissan Ariya—electric crossovers that truly do nothing to separate themselves from the swathes of better gas alternatives, other than ""battery.""
But when those insults are directed at a 1,092-hp Porsche that gets to 60 mph in 2.1 seconds—what are we even doing here?
Part of the problem comes down to exposure, or lack thereof. It’s easier to say an EV sucks when the only one you've experienced firsthand in is an eight-year-old Nissan Leaf. If someone handed you an iPhone 7 in 2024, you’d say the same thing.
Technology evolves rapidly, and modern EVs have come a long way in a short time. The current market has so many awe-inspiring and soul-stirring electric vehicles that you'd be shocked (pun intended).
Take the Rimac Nevera. Two years ago I spent a glorious 30 minutes behind the wheel of what is still the quickest production car in the world. No, the batteries don’t roar to life like the W-16 in the Chiron, nor does an electric powertrain offer the same delectable character as a 911 GT3’s flat-six at 9,000 rpm. The Rimac does other things spectacularly.
The Nevera launches to 60 quicker than the mind can comprehend. No gas engine in the world delivers the same wallop of torque. And a clever torque vectoring system sends the exact amount of twist to each wheel, adjusting that amount at a rate of 100 times per second, so you can go full speed into a turn and the Nevera knows exactly how much twist you need to maximize exit speeds. Try that in a Bugatti and see what happens.
The Nevera is a technological marvel. It’s the amalgamation of my wildest childhood automotive fantasies come to life. Nineteen hundred horsepower packed into a futuristic design with spaceship sounds pumping from the speakers while you full send it into a corner—it's everything video games promised.
The Porsche Taycan has a lot of those same qualities; Instant acceleration matched with an excellent chassis and a world-class suspension. I rode shotgun in the Taycan Turbo GT for a few laps of Porsche’s Atlanta test track with pro driver Jörg Bergmeister at the wheel. And for a posh four-door that weighs nearly 5,000 pounds, it was one of the most dynamic passenger experiences in recent memory.
Engineering is truly amazing.
And it’s not just the most extreme and unattainable, either. Even on the more affordable side of things, cars like the BMW i4 M50, Polestar 2 Performance, and Kia EV6 GT are ripe with instant torque and mind-bending acceleration. The EV6 GT will get you to 60 miles per hour in nearly 3.0 seconds flat. In a Kia.
Soon the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will go on sale and—given the brand’s track record—it’s bound to be another smash-hit from Hyundai’s N Performance division. That, too, is packed to the gills with power (641 hp) and will get you to 60 in just over 3.0 seconds.
That’s not to say you won’t have to make sacrifices, though. There’s certainly an emotional connection missing. Even the quickest and most powerful EVs are about as feelsome as an iPhone when you’re just driving around town; Batteries and electric motors have very little personality. Bugatti’s W-16 (RIP) feels alive underhood of a Chiron—you can barely tell Rimac’s batteries are even there.
The sound and vibration you get from a real gas engine is missing, obviously. Some companies, like Hyundai, are trying to simulate the noise of a gas engine—and it doesn’t sound half bad on the Ioniq 5 N, to be honest. But it’s still a far cry from the real thing.
And then there’s the big one: No manual transmission. The single-speed gearbox in most EVs is duller than dirt; it virtually does away with the idea of shifting entirely. Some companies like Toyota, to their credit, are trying to figure out how to get manuals in their EVs. But it’ll probably still feel a lot like your little brother playing a video game with the controller unplugged. Disconnected entirely.
Affordability is still an issue too. Of all the cars mentioned above, the Kia EV6 GT is the cheapest—and it still costs $62,975. Prices overall will eventually get cheaper as the initial investments in tooling, manufacturing, and battery technology settle, and electric performance cars (in theory) should get cheaper too. Volkswagen recently tempted us with promises of a $25,000 electric GTI, and there are rumors of other sub-$40,000 performance EVs on the horizon
So no, performance EVs aren’t perfect. At least not yet. Even some of the cars I mentioned here don’t move the needle as much as their gas counterparts do in many respects. But electrification is inevitable, so instead of poo-pooing the idea of performance EVs entirely, it’s worth giving some of them a shot. The experience is different, but there’s still a lot to like.
Go take a ride in a Taycan or borrow a buddy’s EV6 GT—who knows, you might actually enjoy yourself.

"Mercedes-Benz EQS Loses Nearly Half Its Value After One Year, Study Says",https://www.motor1.com/news/714685/mercedes-benz-eqs-loses-nearly-half-value/,"That's a whopping $65,143 on average. Meanwhile, a Kia Rio only loses $21 in the first year of ownership.",2024-12-25 08:54:14,"It's no secret that new cars take a big hit on value once they leave the dealership lot. Some take bigger hits than others. Then there's the Mercedes-Benz EQS. With sedan, SUV, and AMG trims combined, the luxury EV loses a whopping 48.7 percent of its average new price after just one year of ownership, according to a study published by iSeeCars. That equates to $65,143—essentially the same as writing off an entire E-Class.
It's not the only electric vehicle on iSeeCar's list of fastest-depreciating cars, either. Five of the top ten vehicles in the study are EVs, starting with the Nissan Leaf in second place. It only loses $15,786 on average, but with a considerably lower starting price, we're still talking about a 45 percent drop. Jaguar holds the distinction of having the highest-depreciating combustion vehicle with the F-Pace in third, losing $28,555, or 35.4 percent of its value. Alfa Romeo isn't far behind with the Giulia at 33.4 percent, dropping $16,297 on average. The Kia EV6 nabs fifth 33.3 percent, losing $18,081 on average.
What about vehicles that aren't taking such a financial beating? The study shows lots of love for hybrid vehicles, but it's the plucky Kia Rio that turned our heads. It seems folks in the US still want an inexpensive combustion-powered subcompact, because it only lost $21 on average after one year of use. It's a drop of just 0.1 percent, meaning a lightly used Rio still fetches a nearly-full sticker price. The fact that it was dropped from Kia's lineup for 2024 could be a factor, too.
Saving face for Mercedes is the G-Class, which ranks third on the least-depreciating scale with a 2.3-percent drop, or $4,587 on average. Meanwhile, the Ford Maverick only loses around $1,400 on average. It holds fourth and fifth place here, representing the standard combustion model and the hybrid at 4.1 and 4.4 percent.
The first-place Land Rover Range Rover has the curious distinction of selling 2.8 percent over its new sticker price on average after one year. We suspect this is skewed due to the new 2024 model slowly reaching the market, pushing up demand for used SUVs as impatient buyers get tired of waiting or refuse to pay high dealer markups. The iSeeCars team mentions this theory as well.
The study evaluated over 1.6 million new and used listings from January through March 2024, incorporating 2023 and 2024 model-year vehicles. In this instance, ""used"" equals a vehicle having mileage within 20 percent of 13,476 miles, largely considered average mileage for a year of use. Low-volume niche vehicles were excluded from the research.
It's interesting to see a clear drop in EV prices versus strong residuals for used hybrids. This supports the softening demand for fully electric vehicles we've seen, while hybrids remain desirable choices for many. The study further breaks down new-versus-used vehicles by price brackets and locations in the US, which you can see at the source link below.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup is a Lighter Electric Race Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/714472/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-en1-cup-debut/,It loses substantial weight and adds race car bits over the regular Ioniq 5 N.,2024-12-25 08:54:15,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is going racing in a dedicated series. It's called the eN1 class and it will consist of sprint races as well as one-on-one knockout races. The new racing series echoes the N1 class featuring the Elantra (Avante in South Korea) and is not limited to a single manufacturer or just one tire vendor.
The first electric N model receives many changes over the road-going car to make it more track friendly. For starters, Hyundai shaved off a lot of fat. While the street-legal Ioniq 5 N weighs up to 4,916 pounds, the eN1 Cup Car sheds nearly 600 pounds. It tips the scales at 4,343 lbs despite getting a full aerodynamic body kit with bulging fenders and a massive rear wing.
The diet was achieved by mounting a fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) hood and polycarbonate windows. It also gets 18-inch forged wheels with slick tires and has a stripped-out cabin with a single bucket seat. Although the Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup Car has been put on a diet, it comes with a lot of hardware not found on the regular model. Hyundai installs a full FIA-compliant roll cage, meaty 18-inch slick tires, an asphyxiation fire layer, and a high-voltage shutoff system.
Other changes over the road-going Ioniq 5 N include an adjustable suspension with two-way dampers, a high-voltage warning indicator, and a charging port relocated at the back. Oddly enough, the race car retains the fake engine noise trickery (N e-Shift) and teams will even be allowed to pick their favorite sounds. The function enabling artificial gear changes (N e-Shift) has also been retained. Battery pre-conditioning is still there, as is the N Grin Boost that unlocks full power for 10 seconds.
The dual motors continue to produce a combined 641 hp as with the road-going Ioniq 5 N from where it has also inherited the 84.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Performance details have not been revealed, but 0 to 60 mph should take around three seconds considering the standard hot electric crossover does the job in 3.25 seconds with the N Grin Boost active.
We'll see the new Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup Car in action for the first time on April 27 during the inaugural round of the 2024 Hyundai N Festival at the Inje Speedium where the eN1 class will have an official practice session. A total of 10 races are set for later this year.

Porsche Explains Why Its Next Electric Hypercar Needs All-Wheel Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/714294/porsche-hypercar-awd-better-efficiency/,"If approved for production, the flagship model will eschew the concept's rear-wheel-drive setup.",2024-12-25 08:54:17,"Porsche hypercars have been few and far between. The 918 Spyder came out in 2013 while the Carrera GT launched in 2004. Even further back, the 959 debuted in 1986. In 2023, Mission X previewed a potential flagship model from Zuffenhausen. Later this year, a decision will be made whether to put the concept into production. If green-lighted, there's going to be a major hardware change.
When the all-electric Mission X debuted in June 2023 to celebrate Porsche's 75th anniversary, the concept had a rear-wheel-drive layout. However, a subsequent road-legal car would switch to an all-wheel-drive setup. Not to unlock extra performance, but to improve efficiency. As weird as that might sound when talking about a hypercar, it makes sense. An AWD setup would significantly increase energy recovery to put more juice back into the battery and help extend the range.
Speaking with Australian magazine Which Car, Mission X project manager Michael Behr explained why AWD would be adopted: ""It's an electric car and you need a four-wheel-driven car to recuperate a lot of energy [for the battery] to have a bigger range on the Nordschleife, not just for one lap, maybe for three laps.""
That's still an extremely low range considering the track is just under 13 miles long, so three laps would be 39 miles. However, Behr was talking about three laps performed by a driver who knows what they’re doing and can extract every drop of performance from the Mission X. Driven at a regular pace, the electric hypercar would likely have a significantly higher range.
That said, it's obvious Porsche doesn't want to cram in a huge battery to extend range since that would add weight. It would be difficult to install a supersized battery anyway since the concept was only 177.1 inches long, so there would be packaging constraints. Behr mentioned the wheelbase would be altered for a production version compared to the concept, which measured 107.5 inches between the axles.
In the concept, the battery was mounted centrally behind the seats and featured direct oil cooling. Porsche developed the Mission X with a 900-volt system architecture to enable charging speeds about twice as quickly as the pre-facelift Taycan Turbo S. The updated electric sedan now supports 320-kilowatt charging power instead of 270 kilowatts, and can replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes.
During the same interview, Behr suggested the production version is likely to be sold strictly with a left-hand-drive layout to reduce complexity. He added it would have more headroom than the 918 Spyder, enabling drivers to comfortably use a helmet. This will be possible by fitting doors that open upwards and forward in the same vein as on the 917 Le Mans racer, which also had the curved glass extending onto the roof.
Porsche has previously said it will approve the Mission X for production only if it meets certain criteria. It must generate more downforce than the 911 GT3 RS and feature a power-to-weight ratio of 1 to 1. In addition, it must double the charging speed of a Taycan Turbo S. Most importantly, it must set a record for a street-legal production car around the Nürburgring. The title currently belongs to the Mercedes-AMG One with a lap time of 6 minutes and 35.18 seconds.
Porsche holds the outright record around the Green Hell with the track-only 919 Hybrid Evo and an incredible 5:19.55 lap.

That gets you the Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid sedan with a whopping 670 horsepower. However, like other Porsche products, the price tag grows quickly when you start to add options.
The Turbo E-Hybrid packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter hybrid V-8 engine that cranks out 680 pound-feet of torque. The sedan can accelerate to 60 miles per hour with the Sport Chrono Package in 3.0 seconds flat and hit a 196-mph top speed with the summer rubber.
The new E-Hybrid has a bit less power than the previous Turbo S E-Hybrid, down from 690, but Porsche countered the drop with an increase in torque by 45 pound-feet. Its electric motor also has a heavier punch—187 hp vs 134. The battery capacity also increases from 17.9 kilowatt hours to 25.9.
Porsche controls all that power and the car’s 5,200-pound weight with its Porsche Active Ride, a fully active suspension system. This allows Porsche to have great control over the car’s body motions, making it lean into corners like a motorcycle or pitch rearward/forward during braking and acceleration.
You can build your Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid on the configurator now. Porsche lists numerous options that can add nearly $100,000 to the price tag, with our most expensive build reaching $285,205. That, thankfully, includes the $1,995 destination charge.
If the Turbo E-Hybrid has too much money and power, the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid starts at $117,495. The 4S E-Hybrid is $128,795 to start, while Porsche prices the entry-level Panamera at $104,795.

We Tried Unusual Sodium Ion Batteries in Our Motocompacto Type R,https://www.motor1.com/features/713344/sodium-ion-motocompacto-type-r/,"Sodium ion is all the rage now, but what's the deal with the emerging chemistry?",2024-12-25 08:54:30,"Lithium-ion is all the rage in EVs, but have you heard of sodium-ion batteries? The excitement around this emerging battery chemistry is huge. As with any new energy storage tech, it can be hard to nail down whether it's a legitimate step toward a sustainable future or just hype. Luckily, sodium ion cells have been commercialized quickly, and regular people can buy them in familiar formats.
As we have our hopped-up Motocompacto lying around, we figured we’d try these new cells to see what they're good for. Could they match up to the performance of a lithium-ion pack? The answer is pretty interesting.
To test this idea out, we decided to make our own battery packs that can accept any variety of 18650-type cells. 18650s, named for their diameter of about 18 millimeters and length of 65 millimeters, are one of the most ubiquitous varieties of batteries available. They're powerful little cylinders, and our circuit board-based pack can accept 12 of them wired in series. This will give us more than enough voltage to get our Motocompacto up to respectable speeds.
I designed these packs mostly as an experiment. They consist of 12 separate cell holders connected by very heavy copper traces and all of the components come pre-soldered on. Charging and discharging happens through an XT60-type connector, which is common for this sort of application. I’m not sure if they’re gonna work, but they were reasonably cheap to order to my specifications, so I figured why not give them a shot? Worst case scenario: Something catches on fire.
In order to do a fair comparison between lithium and sodium-ion cells, I bought both. The Sodium cells were easy enough to find; a reseller called Sriko Batteries sells them online in their own custom wrappers. Their exact origin is unknown to me, however they did come with an OK datasheet. I'll go into the specifics of these cells in a moment.
The lithium cells did not come to me so easily. You can easily buy practically new individual cells online—the kids these days call them loosies—from a handful of reputable websites. They just cost a lot of money. People are generally buying them for vapes or flashlights, so getting just two or three at these prices isn't unreasonable. Getting a dozen costs a lot more.
Luckily, one of my favorite battery resellers had a bunch of good-quality cells for sale in bulk. The only issue was they were in existing enclosures. I bought them, removed them from the enclosures, and had my lithium. They're Molicel INR-18650As, a quality cell with a high discharge rate. Molicel, for reference, makes the batteries that power the quickest electric car on earth; the McMurtry Spierling. Very reputable.
Comparing the two cells is relatively straightforward. Battery cell capacity is determined by multiplying its rating in amp-hours by its nominal voltage, which is a midpoint between fully charged and fully discharged. The sodium cells operate between 2.0V and 4.0V with a nominal voltage of 3.0V. They are rated at 1.3Ah each, which means each contains 3.9 watt-hours of energy. It's worth noting that the datasheet says 1.2Ah, while the wrapper says 1.3Ah. I'm feeling optimistic, though.
The lithium cells butcher them badly in terms of capacity and these aren't even the best 18650s you can buy from Molicel. They are 2.5Ah each, operating between 2.0V and 4.2V (although I only discharge them down to 2.8V). Their nominal capacity is 3.6V. This translates into 9Wh each, which is more than double the sodium cells.
So why even buy the sodium cells? It has everything to do with “buy.” Getting a good quality INR-18650A will cost you $4-$6 each if you don't want to get your hands dirty. For our battery pack that would mean a cost, just in cells, of at least $48. I didn't pay that, but if I wanted nice clean units without having to tear apart any plastic enclosures, that's how much it would cost.
The sodium ion cells arrived spotless and charged up, all ready to go. They cost me $1.52 each. This practically makes them disposable, and keep in mind that the company I bought them from is still making money selling them that cheap. This is after they bought them wholesale and re-wrapped all of them. The hype around sodium-ion is about the price and how, with a little improvement, it might be able to challenge lower-end lithium chemistries, like lithium-iron-phosphate. They also just got commercialized in the last few years and they’re already that cheap. Pretty nuts.
Capacity isn't everything when it comes to batteries. Cells have a specific energy, sure, but also specific power, i.e., how much current they can discharge.
The sodium cells max out at around 13A continuous discharge but can provide more than that in a short burst—around 25 amps. The lithium cells can put out 20A or more continuously. In other words, the sodium cells have a comparable power density, which again is respectable considering the price, even if the capacity isn't very good.
Combining all of these cells into a pack gives us the whole story. The lithium pack contains 108Wh of energy and is capable of providing 864W continuously at nominal voltage, which is great. The sodium pack contains less than half the energy; just 46.8Wh. It can put out 468 watts of energy, though. That's around half the power, but again the cells are 1/3 or even 1/4 the price. You could buy twice as many cells and wire them in parallel to get the same battery performance for less cost, albeit with a physically larger and heavier pack. You can extrapolate how this might translate into full-sized EVs.
In terms of what these are like to ride with the different packs, the lithium one is much quicker. The sodium cells can provide stock Motocompacto performance, but as you’ve probably read in earlier installments of our series, that isn’t saying much. The Molicel pack allows for almost double the performance of the stock scooter. The lithium cells can also charge a little faster than the sodium cells, which means we can regen harder. These 18650As don’t even have especially good charging performance, either. With a different cell, we could harvest even more energy under braking.
So what’s the over-under? Well, sodium-ion is mostly cheap. Another thing I didn’t mention is that it has a good cycle life. These lithium Molicel units have a rating of around 500 cycles before they degrade to roughly 80% capacity. That’s the price you pay for big power. The sodium cells can do more like 3,000 cycles before that degradation occurs. I think a sodium-ion cell with more power density—which I know exists—would be good for hybrid cars or grid storage, where their poor energy density in terms of weight and volume isn’t as important. For hybrids, cycle life and power density are key.
In a nutshell, sodium-ion has yet to see its full potential in a transportation context, but the cost-benefit is huge. The whole scooter battery pack cost me just $18.24 in cells. That’s a great deal, especially considering the stock Honda Motocompacto battery costs more than $300. It has 5x the capacity, sure, but an equivalent sodium bank would still be under $100, and there’s plenty of room in the compacto’s body to store batteries.
Aren’t batteries fun? I love batteries.

Volkswagen R Wants to Be an Independent Brand and Launch Hot EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/713819/volkswagen-r-independent-brand/,R is getting a dedicated section at VW's theme park in Wolfsburg.,2024-12-25 08:54:31,"Volkswagen R started in 2002 with the Golf R32. Then the Passat R sedan/wagon came along in 2008, followed a year later by the Scirocco R, while the Polo R WRC landed in 2013. In recent years, ""R"" has even been used for hot versions of the Arteon and T-Roc, Tiguan, and Touareg SUVs. But in 2024, VW wants R to evolve into an independent brand.
The plan is to open a dedicated Volkswagen R section at the Autostadt theme park in Wolfsburg. If you haven't been there already, it’s a visitor attraction located near the company’s factory, similar in philosophy to the BMW Welt in Munich. Annually, about two million people visit the Autostadt and its multiple pavilions dedicated to VW Group brands, from Skoda and SEAT to Audi and Lamborghini. An R pavilion spanning 1,076 square feet will join them this summer.
Fans of hot VWs will have the opportunity to check out concept cars and limited-run production models. Inevitably, there will be electric performance models on display. VW says the R lineup will gradually evolve in the coming years with amped-up EVs in the works. The process has already started with the Touareg R—complete with a plug-in hybrid V-6 powertrain.
However, there's still life left in the ol' internal combustion engine. The Golf R facelift is coming out this summer but sadly without a manual gearbox. That won't be such a dealbreaker in Europe where the Mk8 was never offered with three pedals but the stick shift will be missed by enthusiasts in the US.
VW’s decision to distance R (originally called Volkswagen Individual GmbH) from the main brand started in 2020 when it became a separate business unit. Elsewhere within the VW Group, SEAT went a step further with its US-bound Cupra spin-off marque by introducing standalone models. Audi Sport is also a separate entity within Audi.
As to what the future entails, VW has said the ninth-gen Golf will be exclusively electric. Will that be the first electric R? Time will tell, but we're likely going to see an electric GTI first. Spicy EVs are already part of the company's portfolio since the GTX models have more power, including even the ID. Buzz GTX minivan.
In the meantime, R is doing better than ever as more than 35,000 cars were produced in 2023, a record for the brand. Since 2002, over 300,000 R-badged vehicles have been sold.

Porsche Caught Testing Electric Boxster with Fake Exhaust,https://www.motor1.com/news/713806/porsche-boxster-electric-spy-video/,It had a large charging port door.,2024-12-25 08:54:33,"With Porsche killing the 718 in Europe due to cybersecurity regulations, its all-electric successor can't come soon enough. Ahead of its release in 2025, the Boxster EV was spotted cold-weather testing in Scandinavia. Some of these prototypes now have the final headlights and taillights, but that center exhaust tip is definitely fake.
This is a running joke with Porsche; both Taycan prototypes had fake exhaust tips before they debuted. In addition, the Macan EV was also seen with fake exhausts during the testing phase. We won't be surprised if the already confirmed three-row electric SUV and Cayenne EV will adopt a similar setup once testing starts.
But we can't help but notice the large charging port door in the center of the rear bumper. EV owners usually juice up the batteries from one of the car's sides, but that won't be the case with the future Boxster. It's also different from what Porsche is using considering the Taycan has dual charging ports on the front fenders while the Macan has the pair on the rear fenders. We can't tell because the prototypes are still cleverly camouflaged but it looks as though the next-gen 718 will only have one charging port.
Likely carrying the ""983"" internal codename, the next-gen 718 could retain the ""Boxster"" moniker despite doing away with the boxer engine. That wouldn't be surprising—the Taycan Turbo doesn't have a turbocharger. These are popular nameplates Porsche doesn't want to retire.
The new electric sports car will retain the fabric roof, two-seat layout, and front trunk, but it will be a different model underneath the skin. It could borrow bits and pieces from the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) hardware co-developed by Porsche with Audi. We're expecting rear- and all-wheel-drive versions with single- and dual-motor setups, respectively. The Boxster is likely to come out first, with the Cayman coupe to follow shortly after that.
The new electric-only Macan has a lithium-ion battery pack with a usable capacity of 95.0 kilowatt-hours, but Porsche might downsize it for the Boxster/Cayman to reduce the weight penalty. People buying a sports car are more willing to settle for less range if that means extra performance. If the future 718 gets the same 800-volt architecture as the crossover, it should support DC charging at 270 kilowatts.
Don't expect a design overhaul since Porsche prefers evolutionary over revolutionary. However, the current car's interior is beginning to show its age, which is why prototypes of its replacement have been spotted with a more modern dashboard. Aside from the usual bigger screens, those cars had touch buttons on the center console to adjust the temperature as well as the heated and ventilated seats.
The future 718s will be sold exclusively with electric power but the current Boxster and Cayman are not going away. Although the duo is being phased out in the European Union, the gasoline sports cars are sticking around in other markets. Porsche will sell the ICE and EV models together for an unspecified amount of time before inevitably pulling the plug on the former. It's the same story with the old and new Macan.

VW Says There's No Market for an ID.Buzz Camper Van,https://www.motor1.com/news/713335/vw-no-market-id-buzz-camper/,Rumored production delays due to excessive weight aren't a concern if nobody wants to buy one.,2024-12-25 08:54:34,"When the Volkswagen ID. Buzz debuted back in 2022, talk of a pop-top camper model pretty much debuted with it. And why not? Camping adventures and the classic VW bus go together like peanut butter and chocolate, but a modern take on this formula is likely years away, if it materializes at all. That is, at least in an ID. Buzz California camper coming directly from Volkswagen.
The holdup isn't development problems as reported last year. According to Autocar, VW executives simply don't see enough demand to warrant the expense of building it right now. Citing Lars Krause, sales and marketing head for VW, there are some expected development challenges that are typical for any new model. But also, buyers aren't ready to commit to an electric camper.
""I can tell you we always start from the market, and looking at the market figures and looking closely at our customers, it turned out that the need for these types of vehicles— BEV-driven campers—is not there yet from our perspective,"" said Krause, as reported by Autocar.
He further states that demand is expected to increase by the end of the decade and that VW is targeting that timeframe for a possible ID. Buzz California launch. In the meantime, there is the Volkswagen California based on the T7 Multivan slated for European markets this year. It debuted last August as a near-production prototype, bringing the iconic California moniker and pop-top roof to a plug-in hybrid platform.
VW Commercial Vehicles CEO Carsten Intra believes it will serve as a stepping stone toward electrified campers, and as such, we suspect its sales will be monitored very closely. If buyers don't respond to a larger PHEV California, it's reasonable to think a smaller EV California could be nixed completely. Only time will tell on that front.
The irony is that, despite bearing the name of a US state, the VW T7 California won't be offered for sale in North America. When (or if) the ID. Buzz California goes live, it could make the journey. It would be based on the long-wheelbase model, which is the only version offered to US buyers.

Audi's New Entry-Level EV Will Be 'Wonderful and Unique',https://www.motor1.com/news/713158/entry-level-audi-ev-2027/,It’ll slot below the Q4 E-Tron and could be called the Q2. It debuts in 2027.,2024-12-25 08:54:35,"Audi is planning to launch a new, entry-level electric vehicle in 2027. It’ll slot below the Q4 E-Tron in the lineup, but company CEO Gernot Döllner was reluctant to dish out additional details about the upcoming model.
He told Autocar that the new EV would be a ""wonderful, unique independent vehicle concept."" It might ride on the MEB architecture, but Döllner admitted the company hadn’t decided which platform would underpin the car. We’ll likely learn about the EV’s battery size and chemistry, range, and power output at its debut.
Audi will accelerate the car’s development to meet its 2027 launch date. It and other automakers are increasingly wary of cheap Chinese EVs and are responding accordingly. In June last year, VW Group CEO Oliver Blume admitted Audi lagged behind its rivals due to software issues, saying it would speed up the luxury brand’s EV development.
The company will produce its entry-level EV in Ingolstadt, Germany, which could wear the A2/Q2 name. Audi has reserved even numbers for its EVs and odd ones for its combustion-powered cars. While Audi could produce a small sedan, the likelier product is a compact crossover with the Q nomenclature as consumers still flock to the high-riding models.
The Audi Q6 E-Tron debuted earlier this week, joining the portfolio's E-Tron GT, Q4 E-Tron, and Q8 E-Tron models. An entry-level EV would help flesh out the lineup, but it’s three years away from going on sale, and competition will only continue to increase. Audi might not even offer it in the US, and it could still be expensive. The 2024 Q4 E-Tron starts at $56,395 (the price includes the $1,195 destination charge).

Future BMW Electric Cars Will Have Bidirectional Charging,https://www.motor1.com/news/713239/bmw-bidirectional-charging-neue-klasse/,Neue Klasse models will power your household.,2024-12-25 08:54:36,"The Neue Klasse will be BMW's long-awaited dedicated electric car platform when it debuts next year with an SUV. Previewed today by the Vision Neue Klasse X concept, the architecture is bringing a handy feature that other automakers have had for years. Better late than never, the new wave of EVs with the famous white and blue roundel will support bidirectional charging.
That means the future iX3 SUV (2025) and i3 sedan (2026) will double as power banks to juice up your house, appliances, e-bikes, camping gear, and other products. While luxury automakers tend to charge (pun intended) you for just about everything, bidirectional charging is going to be standard on Neue Klasse-based models. Functions such as Vehicle to Home, Vehicle to Grid, and Vehicle to Load will all be supported without having to pay more.
While the current EVs and PHEVs use batteries with prismatic cells, the next wave of batteries will switch to round cells. BMW estimates that charging speed and range will increase by 30 percent, while energy density is going up by 20 percent. These sixth-generation batteries will power your toaster and whatnot.
BMW intends to roll out bidirectional charging in three stages, kicking off with Vehicle to Home for your household. Vehicle to Grid will follow, allowing the car's owner to feed the stored energy back into the network but only in countries where legislation allows it. Vehicle to Load will power external electrical equipment. Interestingly, the German luxury marque doesn't say anything about Vehicle to Vehicle to provide energy to another Neue Klasse EV.
After the launch of the iX3 and i3, BMW intends to launch at least four more models on the same underpinnings by 2028. By the end of the decade, the Munich-based marque projects more than half of its global annual sales will be represented by EVs. In the early 2030s, Mini and Rolls-Royce will go completely electric.

The New Three-Row Peugeot 5008 Has Hybrid and Electric Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/713069/2024-peugeot-5008-reveal-specs/,The boxy SUV gets a 21-inch screen and a striking front fascia.,2024-12-25 08:54:37,"The third-generation Peugeot 5008 plugs into Europe's already crowded SUV segment in more ways than one. It's available with a fully electric drivetrain but you can also have the three-row family hauler with a plug-in hybrid setup. Alternatively, the French brand part of Stellantis plans to sell a cheaper mild-hybrid model as well.
Essentially, the new 5008 is an enlarged version of the latest 3008 introduced in 2023. It sits on the STLA Medium platform and has the following dimensions: 188.5 inches long, 74.4 inches wide, and 66.5 inches tall, with a generous wheelbase of 114.1 inches. One major advantage it has over the Tesla Model Y sold in Europe is the availability of a third row.
You can imagine there's not much cargo space left with all seven seats in place, but 9.1 cubic feet should suffice for short trips around town. In the five-seat configuration, the luggage capacity jumps to 26.4 cubic feet. Should you need even more, you can fold the second row as well and unlock a cavernous 64.0 cubic feet.
While SUVs nowadays tend to have swoopy rooflines, the new Peugeot 5008 retains the boxy shape of its predecessor to maximize interior space. It largely inherits the design of its E-3008 smaller brother, complete with the same 21-inch display positioned atop the dashboard. There are also 10 customizable touch controls providing shortcuts to often-used functions accessible from the center console.
The most affordable version will be powered by a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with 48V technology. This tiny three-cylinder mill sends 136 horsepower to the front wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission featuring a built-in electric motor.
Should you need more oomph, the plug-in hybrid combines a 150-hp combustion engine with a 123-hp electric motor for a total system output of 195 hp channeled through a seven-speed, dual-clutch auto. This PHEV can cover more than 50 miles on electric power before the gas engine starts feeding from the 15.8-gallon fuel tank.
Then there’s the fully electric E-5008 model available in multiple configurations. The single-motor, front-wheel-drive versions come with 210 hp and 228 hp, both of which offer an instant torque of 254 pound-feet. Step up to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model, and the combined output is rated at 318 hp.
Stick to the front-wheel-drive model and Peugeot installs a 73.0-kilowatt-hour battery good for 311 miles. The bigger 98.0-kWh pack means fewer stops at a charging station since the range grows to 410 miles. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version gets the bigger battery but efficiency takes a hit due to the vehicle's higher curb weight.
Those batteries are guaranteed for eight years or 100,000 miles during which Peugeot is sure charging capacity won't drop below 70 percent. A heat pump comes as standard, as does the 11-kW charger. You can optionally get a 22-kilowatt charger, while DC charging can support up to 160 kW. In this case, it takes 10 minutes to put enough energy in the battery for 62 miles. Spending half an hour at a charging station replenishes the battery from 20 to 80 percent.
In recent years, Stellantis has ruled out a return for Peugeot to North America but that STLA Medium platform is likely to underpin a series of US-bound electric models.

"The New Audi A5, Q5, And A6 E-Tron Confirmed For 2024 Reveal",https://www.motor1.com/news/713087/audi-a5-q5-a6-e-tron-coming-2024/,More than 20 new models are due by late 2025.,2024-12-25 08:54:39,"It's only March, but Audi has already introduced several new products. It started with the updated Q7 in late January before the RS6 Avant GT arrived in early February. The revised S3 debuted a few days later, followed by the normal A3 facelift last week. The first-ever Q6 E-Tron joined the fray a few days ago. But there's much more to come later this year.
The 154-page Audi Report 2023 document mentions more than 20 new products will hit the market before the end of next year. Leading the way will be the A6 E-Tron (pictured above in prototype guise). It's arriving in the following months as a fully electric model based on the Premium Platform Electric. The PPE hardware has been co-developed with Porsche and has already underpinned the Q6 E-Tron and Macan. The new A6 E-Tron will be sold as a sedan (well, it'll technically be a five-door hatchback) and as a wagon.
In the year's second half, Audi will take the wraps off the next-generation A5 lineup and the Q5. These models will ride on what the Four Rings refers to as the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), which will be an evolution of the VW Group's existing MLB architecture. The German luxury brand doesn't mention the A4 at all, and that's because it's going away.
The A4 we know today will become the A5, leaving room in the lineup for a future electric-only A4 E-Tron. Audi doesn't say whether there will be another sedan in this segment with combustion engines or whether the A5 Sportback will supersede the A4 Sedan. Spy shots have revealed the wagon will live to see another generation, so prepare for A5/S5/RS5 Avant models to be offered alongside the Sportback.
Car paparazzi haven't seen any prototypes of an A5 coupe or a convertible but here's hoping the two-door models are still planned. That said, the segment is shrinking, which is why Mercedes has fused the C-Class and E-Class coupe and convertible models to create the CLE.
The Q5 will enter its third generation in 2024, and just like the upcoming A5, it's getting a new family of ""highly efficient"" combustion engines with plug-in hybrid power. These will be the last ICE developments from Audi since the brand intends to launch its final cars with conventional powertrains in 2026. Every new launch after will be an EV because the company wants to go purely electric by the end of 2033.
Meanwhile, here are some of the other models we think are coming out by late 2025. There should be a Q3 compact crossover successor, a facelifted RS3 hot hatch/sedan duo, a Q6 E-Tron Sportback with a rakish roofline, an electric A8 sedan replacement, and a Q9 three-row SUV.
The A1 and Q2 won't be renewed as Audi has announced that these models will be retired at the end of their life cycle. The TT suffered the same fate last year when it was discontinued, with the R8 facing an imminent death as well.

GM Thinks Tetris-Shaped Batteries Could Be the Key to Better Cooling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712993/gm-tetris-shaped-battery-cells/,Battery cells are typically only rectangular or cylindrical. GM might change that.,2024-12-25 08:54:39,"General Motors has plans to operate four battery plants, with one in Lordstown, Ohio already pumping out cells. With the ability to make its own batteries comes the potential for custom configurations and form factors, something the company is considering taking to the extreme. A recent patent from GM shows batteries not shaped like rectangles or cylinders, but Tetris-like blocks meant to accommodate more efficient cooling channels.
The document is currently just an application, but it was published very recently in late February, with a recent file date as well. All of this seems to indicate it's a new idea out of the automaker that it may have wanted to protect quickly. It begins by saying how battery cells are currently cooled, at least in GM's case. In cars like the Hummer EV, we know this is achieved on a module-by-module basis with a cooling plate at the bottom of the cells. In this patent, GM claims this method can lead to uneven cooling, which leads to premature battery degradation. As a side note, other companies use other cooling methods to combat this phenomenon.
GM's idea is to make the cells in a rough ""L"" or ""C"" shape so that two cells combined will leave one or more tunnels between the cells where a cooling channel can be added. GM even has some unusual diagonal shapes in there.
I'm not aware of any other battery cell, at least in automotive use, that is shaped anything like this.  I have personally only ever seen rectangular prisms or cylinders. There might be considerable manufacturing challenges associated with making these strange cells, though it's tough to tell going only by this application.
To that end, the company suggests other possible configurations using rectangular prismatic cells but achieving a similar effect. Two of the cells in a proposed four-cell group would be shorter and fatter, while the other pair would be longer and skinnier. This would allow for a rectangular or H-shaped cooling channel. Longer and skinnier cells like that are less common, but there's one China-based company, Topband, that makes somewhat similar long slender lithium iron-phosphate cells.
In any case, GM's idea is an unusual one that may have some merit, but it's unclear if developing an entirely new cell format in the name of cooling would be an effective approach to improving electric vehicles. If the company patented it, it's likely worth exploring, at least conceptually.

Bentley Delays First EV Due To Software Problems,https://www.motor1.com/news/712921/bentley-first-electric-vehicle-delayed/,It's also pushing back the goal to become electric-only from 2030 to 2033.,2024-12-25 08:54:40,"Bentley intended to introduce its first electric model in 2025—but that's not happening. CEO Adrian Hallmark told Automotive News Europe the EV has been delayed by a year because of technical problems caused by software issues as well as ""platform-related concerns."" Crewe's inaugural EV is now expected to break cover near the end of 2026, but customer deliveries won't start until 2027.
Separately, Autocar has learned Bentley is also pushing back its goal to become entirely electric by the end of the decade. According to the new agenda, the ultra-luxury British brand wants to completely get rid of gasoline cars by 2033. The three-year delay will allow the company to invest more in plug-in hybrids to provide a smoother transition to an EV-only lineup early into the next decade.
The inaugural EV is going to be manufactured at home in the UK and will be underpinned by the Premium Platform Electric co-developed by Porsche and Audi. The first PPE-based models have been recently revealed as the second-generation Macan in January and the Q6 E-Tron earlier this week. While all three brands sit underneath the Volkswagen Group umbrella, Audi technically owns Bentley (as well as Lamborghini and Ducati) since 2022.
The decision to delay the EV isn't surprising. The Macan and Q6 E-Tron were also supposed to arrive sooner, per the original announcements. Before the first zero-emission model arrives, Bentley is preparing to launch a high-performance plug-in hybrid setup based around a V-8. It'll indirectly replace the venerable W-12, which is sadly going away with the 740-horsepower Batur.
The company's head honcho admits Bentley had estimated demand for hybrids would decrease closer to the end of the decade, but it's now expected to rise. Consequently, the high-end automaker is pouring ""hundreds of millions"" into a new wave of PHEVs that'll remain on sale early into the next decade to meet demand.
We'll be seeing that punchy V8 PHEV setup in the GT, GTC, and Flying Spur later in 2024. The current V-6 PHEV is staying while the Bentayga will retain its pure gasoline powertrain until 2026 when the posh SUV is set to become electric-only.
The now-delayed EV won't replace an existing model as it'll be a completely different product. When it does arrive, it's getting a hotter Speed version touted as ""the W12 of batteries"" with electric motors developed to deliver 50 to 100 percent more power than ICEs. For now, the most potent model on this PPE platform is the Porsche Macan Turbo with 630 hp and 833 pound-feet of torque.
The batteries that will go inside Bentley's first EV will have enough juice for 350 to 450 miles on a single charge, according to a statement made last year by Hallmark. It'll take less than 20 minutes to replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent.
For the time being, the Bentayga is the undisputed sales king with a 44-percent share of the total volume in 2023. The Continental GT/GTC is next with 31 percent while the Flying Spur occupies the last spot on the podium with a 25-percent share. In 2023, total deliveries dropped by 11 percent to 13,560 units.

Porsche Electric Hypercar: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/712820/porsche-electric-hypercar-horsepower-range-price/,A new Porsche halo car is on the horizon. And it’s going to be electric (literally).,2024-12-25 08:54:41,"Porsche is on a steady path toward electrifying its entire lineup. The company launched the Taycan in 2019, and the new Macan EV will go on sale later this year. An electric 718 is set to debut in 2024, with the Cayenne joining the EV bandwagon sometime after that.
Still, we're most excited about what could sit at the top of Porsche's electric portfolio: A new hypercar.
Porsche teased us with the stunning Mission X concept last year, and we could see a production version by the end of 2024. The company has been tight-lipped about the project otherwise. But there are some early rumors and details that paint a thrilling picture of what could be the brand's next icon. Here’s what we know so far.
The Porsche Mission X is a concept that debuted in 2023 as part of the automaker's 75th-anniversary celebration. Engineers worked under the codename XS23 for up to a year ahead of its reveal.
The Mission X previews what a future, all-electric hypercar could look like from the brand. It would succeed models like the 918 Spyder and the Carrera GT. The Mission X draws inspiration from those icons as well as Porsche's success on the track.
Porsche took cues from Le Mans prototype race cars like the 919 Hybrid, most notably with the doors that open forward and upward. Vertical headlights adorn a pointed nose with massive air intakes at the base of the bumper that help with cooling and aerodynamics.
A glass bubble covers a luxurious cabin lined with deep bucket seats, contrasting colors, exposed carbon, six-point harnesses, and an F1-inspired steering wheel. That glass cabin forms a svelte rear with an embedded spoiler and an illuminated Porsche logo flanked by slim taillights on either side.
Hopefully the production version looks a lot like the Mission X, but it's unclear how many of these cues will translate to the road. Our rendering (pictured above) previews a production version of the Porsche Mission X with many of the same elements as the concept but with Porsche's paint-to-sample Smyrna Green, aerodynamic-friendly wheels, and a few other subtle touches.
Believe it or not, the Porsche Mission X concept has a mid-motor layout. Unlike other EVs that position their batteries in the floorboard, the Mission X's batteries are behind the seats. They call it an ""e-core"" configuration. Porsche did this to try and recreate the handling dynamics of a mid-engine car. It's unclear whether that same layout will make it to production.
Beyond that, Porsche hasn't offered specifics about the powertrain. The Mission X concept had a power-to-weight ratio of one horsepower per 2.2 pounds and a 900-volt architecture. So if the new hypercar weighs around 3,700 pounds—like the 918 Spyder—it could have as much as 1,700 horsepower. It should also be Porsche's first vehicle with three electric motors and all-wheel drive.
With an estimated 1,700 hp, Porsche's EV hypercar should be pretty damn quick. The dual-motor Taycan Turbo GT will hit 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds with the Weissach package, so a tri-motor hypercar could be even quicker. Under 2.0 seconds isn't out of the realm of possibility.
Porsche has already said it wants to break the Nurburgring production lap time, which would mean outpacing the Mercedes-AMG One's 6:30.70 lap time. If it's gunning for the production EV record, it would have to beat the Rimac Nevera's 7:05.29 lap time. The Porsche 918 Spyder completed a lap of the Nurburgring in 6:57.00.
The Mission X concept is relatively compact by modern supercar standards. It’s about 6 inches shorter than the 918 Spyder; 182.9 versus 177.0 inches. And it’s a full 10 inches shorter than the Rimac Nevera (187.0 inches). However, the Mission X is 2.0 inches wider than the 918 and has the same wheelbase of 107.5 inches.
Expect Porsche's hypercar to command over six figures. The company recently introduced the Taycan Turbo GT with 1,092 horsepower and a starting price of $232,000, making it Porsche's priciest EV to date. The electric hypercar should easily beat that to become one of the most expensive cars on sale.
For comparison's sake, the 918 Spyder went on sale in 2013 for $845,000—but current hypercar prices easily stretch into the millions. The Rimac Nevera costs $2.4 million, the Mercedes-AMG One is $2.7 million, and the Aston Martin Valkyrie is over $3.0 million.
Production of Porsche's new hypercar is expected to be limited. The company only built 918 examples of the 918 Spyder, and the Carrera GT was limited to just 1,270 examples. The 959 was even rarer still; Porsche only built 292 of them.
Porsche could confirm production of the new hypercar by the end of this year. CEO Oliver Blume said that feedback on the Mission X concept has been ""massively positive,"" and that ""it’s a great motivation for us to do the car.""

The First Standalone Mercedes-AMG EV Has NA Miata-Looking Fake Taillights,https://www.motor1.com/news/712744/amg-electric-sedan-prototype-teaser/,"Don't worry, the production model will have different rear lights.",2024-12-25 08:54:43,"Hiding underneath the swirly camouflage and those Miata-like taillights is the first Mercedes model on the AMG.EA platform. It's a sports sedan engineered from day one strictly as an EV to serve as a replacement for the current AMG 4-Door Coupe. The latter has already received the hybrid treatment, but its successor will forgo the combustion engine altogether to embrace a pure EV setup.
Judging by the swoopy shape of the prototype's rear, it'll be a more practical liftback rather than a traditional sedan. That wouldn’t come as a surprise since the outgoing model is also a five-door hatchback, despite its confusing ""coupe"" name. A closer look at these official teaser images reveals an active rear spoiler and front canards. The production version should have more than a few things in common with the 2022 Vision AMG Concept.
The road-going model will go after the likes of the Porsche Taycan by offering a more dynamic ride than AMG versions of the EQE. It will use disc-shaped axial-flux electric motors with ""unparalleled mix of power density, size, and weight"" compared to traditional cylindrical radial-flux motors. The peeps from Affalterbach have already revealed one motor can churn 480 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque while weighing only 53 pounds.
Aside from having new motors, the AMG.EA-based model is expected to employ a slimmer battery pack with a 40 percent boost in energy density. The dedicated architecture should also enable a roomier cabin by not having to make compromises associated with ICE cars adapted for EV duty. This will be possible by stretching the wheelbase and shortening the front and rear overhangs. The SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012 was an ICE-to-EV supercar.
Currently testing on a frozen lake in Sweden at temperatures as low as -13 degrees Fahrenheit, the sporty EV is heading to other regions of the world for additional evaluations. We're not expecting the high-performance electric model to go on sale this year but the official reveal might take place late 2024 or early 2025.

Volkswagen Will Reveal its High-Performance ID.Buzz GTX on March 21,https://www.motor1.com/news/712626/vw-id-buzz-gtx-reveal-march-21/,"Spotted testing at the Nürburgring last year, the performance-oriented electric van will carry the GTX nameplate.",2024-12-25 08:54:44,"Volkswagen announced on Friday plans to reveal a new performance vehicle during its annual press conference happening March 21. The company published a teaser image to LinkedIn alongside the announcement showing the headlight silhouette of an ID.Buzz electric van, suggesting a high-performance version of VW's people-mover is less than a month away.
Confirmed for production at the beginning of 2023, the ID.Buzz GTX will join the company's other sporty EV offerings, the ID.3 GTX and the ID.7 GTX Tourer, in VW's growing list of high-performance, zero-emissions vehicles.
Volkswagen's been mum on details regarding the ID.Buzz GTX, saying only that it'll make 335 horsepower thanks to a dual-motor all-wheel drive system, mirroring output on the ID.7 GTX. We expect other upgrades too, like a stiffer suspension, better brakes, bigger wheels, and a sportier interior.
The ID.Buzz GTX has been on our radar for months now. An all-white test mule said to be a prototype for the car was spotted by our spy photographers on the road last summer. Not long after that, it was caught lapping the Nürburgring during an industry test pool session. So the timing of this reveal makes sense.
It's unclear right now whether Volkswagen is planning to bring this high-performance ID.Buzz variant to the United States. Neither the ID.3 GTX nor the ID.7 GTX tourer are slated for US consumption, and the normal ID.Buzz has yet to even go on sale Stateside. Moreover, Volkswagen's electric GTI has yet to be greenlit for the US. With demand for electric vehicles waning, a sporty EV van sounds like a very niche product that might not conjure the demand VW expects. Either way, we'd love to give one a go.

The Skoda Epiq Has A Pompous Name But It's Just Another Electric Crossover,https://www.motor1.com/news/712518/skoda-epiq-concept-debut/,"The production version is coming in 2025 and will cost the equivalent of $27,000.",2024-12-25 08:54:46,"Skoda intends to launch six EVs by 2026, and the most affordable of the bunch will be this pretentiously named Epiq. It’s scheduled to go on sale next year with a targeted starting price of €25,000, or roughly $27,000 at current exchange rates. Touted as being ""small but epic,"" the brand's entry-level EV will be among the first models to embrace the fresh ""Modern Solid"" design language.
At around 4.1 meters (161.4 inches) long, you can think of it as an electric alternative to the Kamiq. However, the subcompact Skoda Epiq is destined to ride on a dedicated EV platform, likely the MEB Entry the Volkswagen Group has already announced. The architecture has been previewed by the German automotive conglomerate with last year's ID.2all concept. While VW is going the hatchback route, Skoda is cooking up this crossover.
Even though it's shorter than the Kamiq we mentioned earlier, it's far more practical. The cargo capacity of 490 liters (17.3 cubic feet) is more than 20 percent higher thanks to the dedicated EV underpinnings, resulting in better packaging. The Czech marque remains tight-lipped about the other technical specifications, but it does say the unspecified battery pack is good for over 249 miles (400 kilometers) of range, presumably in the WLTP cycle.
The MEB Entry platform is intended for EVs with front-wheel drive whereas the regular MEB used by the bigger Enyaq comes with rear-wheel drive. The more expensive and powerful MEB-based models sold by the VW Group come with AWD by adding a front motor. It remains to be seen whether the MEB Entry models will get an all-paw setup at some point.
The Modern Solid design language per Skoda's marketing jargon will toughen up the appearance of future models. This Epiq has plastic body cladding around the wheel arches and unpainted sections of the rear bumpers. We also notice a pair of nifty roof rails, an illuminated rear badge, and slim lights at both ends.
The charging port is mounted on the front fender rather than at the back as is the case with the Enyaq. Contrasting orange accents are found inside and out, along with an interrupted light bar that goes across the wide grille. Overall, the Epiq looks to be more along the lines of a near-production prototype since it's unlikely to change all that much until 2025. Skoda calls it a design study rather than a concept.
Before the Epiq arrives in 2025, the bigger Elroq compact crossover will be officially unveiled later this year with an electric-only setup. These two will be joined by 2026 by the next-generation Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe. An Octavia-like wagon in EV flavor is also coming, along with a large three-row SUV previewed by the Vision 7S sans a combustion engine.

"Majority Of Drivers Are Afraid Of Autonomous Cars, Study Says",https://www.motor1.com/news/712439/drivers-afraid-autonomous-cars-study/,"Sixty-six percent of respondents said they feared self-driving cars, up from 55 percent in 2022.",2024-12-25 08:54:46,"The promise of fully self-driving cars remains elusive. That might be a good thing, at least going by a new study from AAA that found the majority of people are actually afraid of autonomous vehicles. Even more surprising: That number has increased in recent years while public trust has fallen.
According to AAA, 66 percent of respondents said they feared self-driving vehicles. That’s up from 55 percent in 2022, but down from 68 percent last year. The share of those who trust AVs held steady from 2023 to 2024 at 9 percent, while 25 percent were unsure of them. Both numbers are down from 15 and 30 percent, respectively, in 2022.
While buyers might be weary of robot cars, they aren’t opposed to some technological assistance behind the wheel. Respondents said they were interested in some technology, with more than half open to automatic braking, reverse automatic braking, and lane keep assist. Only 42 percent were interested in active driving assist, and 49 percent were for adaptive cruise control.
Are Self-Driving Cars The Future:
Buyers should be skeptical of even those driver aids, however, as another AAA study discovered that they aren’t always reliable. The organization recently researched the effectiveness of automatic rear braking systems, and only one out of 40 test runs ended without a crash. Half of the cars failed to stop for stationary pedestrians standing behind the vehicle.
Most buyers won’t have to worry about autonomous vehicles anytime soon. General Motors’ Cruise division has faced significant safety hurdles over the last few months, and it appears that Google’s Waymo is one of the remaining outfits putting in a full effort to develop the technology. It expanded its robotaxi service to Los Angeles today, but the tech is still years away from making it into everyday passenger vehicles.

15 Fastest EVs To Lap The Nurburgring,https://www.motor1.com/features/712434/fastest-ev-nurburgring/,"Some are production cars, others are track-only—but all of them are silent speed demons.",2024-12-25 08:54:48,"Porsche's new Taycan Turbo GT just broke a record to become the fastest production four-door to lap the famed Nurburgring Nordschleife—and the second-fastest production EV. Porsche accomplished that feat in 7:07.55, making it quicker around the Green Hell than a vast majority of cars on sale today, gas or electric.
But it's not the reigning EV champion. One production car and a few electric race cars and concepts have done it faster. Since 2010, automakers have been taking their performance EVs to the track in hopes of capturing a lap record. And as more performance EVs enter the market, expect more record-breaking laps in the months and years to come.
In the meantime, we've put together a list of the 15 fastest electric vehicles to ever do it. These cars all have a spot in the Nurburgring record books for their fast laps, and some of them won't see their records broken anytime soon.
6:05.3
Before the ID.4, the ID.Buzz, and the rest of Volkswagen's electric vehicle lineup, the mad scientists in Wolfsburg cooked an EV concept the world had never seen. The ID.R was a no-holds-barred, battery-powered race car with 671 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque thanks to two electric motors—oh, and it only weighed 2,500 pounds.
In 2019, VW unleashed the ID.R on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with French racing driver Romain Dumas behind the wheel. The epic run resulted in a record-breaking lap time of 6:05.336, making it the fastest EV—and one of the fastest cars ever—around the historic track. There isn't a single production car that's faster, and only the Porsche 919 Hybrid EVO race car had a better lap time (5:19.546).
6:45.9
The Nio EP9 isn't technically a production car, even though the company built and sold 10 of them between 2016 and 2019 for a cool $3 million each. The track-only hypercar had four electric motors mounted on each wheel for a total output of 1,341 horsepower and 1,091 pound-feet of torque, good for a 0-60 mph time of around 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 194 mph.
In 2017, Nio let the EP9 loose on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with British racing driver Peter Dumbreck behind the wheel. Dumbreck set a lap time of 6:45.90—beating the Nio's former record 7:05.12 set in 2016 (this time with race tires), and second only to the McLaren P1 XP1 LM Prototype at the time, which did it in 6:43.22. The EV9 is currently fifth on the list of non-production cars and second only in EVs to the VW ID.R.
7:05.2
The first real, actual production car on this list is the Rimac Nevera—even if it is a $2.2-million hypercar. Powered by four permanent-magnet synchronous electric motors, the Nevera has 1,888 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 1.7 seconds. It is, by definition, the quickest car on sale today.
It's no slouch on the track, either. Late in 2023, Rimac set a production EV record with the Nevera on the Nurburgring Nordschleife with a lap time of 7:05.29. Croatian racing driver Martin Kodric was behind the wheel.
7:07.5
The newest entrant on this list (as mentioned earlier) is the Taycan Turbo GT—the quickest, most powerful production Porsche ever. With up to 1,092 horsepower courtesy of two electric motors, this Taycan races to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds and on to a top speed of 190. And with the Wiessach package (the first four-door Porsche to get the option), this Taycan ditches the rear seats and adds carbon fiber to keep the hefty EV under 5,000 pounds.
Back in January, Porsche took a Taycan Turbo GT prototype with the Weissach package to the Nurburgring and recorded a lap time of 7:07.55. With seasoned racing driver Lars Kern behind the wheel, the Turbo GT became the fastest four-door EV on the ‘Ring and the fastest of any four-door production sedan, beating out the Jaguar XE Project 8.
7:22.3
In case the name didn't give it away, this is no production Toyota. The TMG EV P002 was an electric race car prototype produced by Toyota in 2012 with 469 horsepower and 885 pound-feet of torque. With Jochen Krumbach behind the wheel, Toyota took to the Nurburgring that same year and recorded a fast lap of 7:22.32. At that time Toyota did break the EV lap record, but it was short-lived.
7:25.2
The Porsche/Tesla rivalry escalated in 2023. Tesla returned to the Nordschleife two years after its first run with another Model S Plaid, this time fitted with an optional Track package. The Track pack added better brakes a higher top-speed limiter, as well as controversial tires. While legal in the US, the tires didn't meet European requirements for road use, leading some to call the lap null and void for a street-legal vehicle.
However you view it, the hefty sedan still covered the north loop in 7:25.2. It easily topped the Taycan Turbo S to claim the EV production record once again, but it was short-lived. A few months later, the Rimac Nevera would sail in to effectively shut down the Porsche/Tesla rivalry.
7:33.3
The second Taycan record attempt at the Nurburgring came in 2022. Whether or not Tesla's 2021 record with the Model S Plaid had anything to do with it is unknown, but Porsche managed to lop off nearly 10 seconds compared to the lap laid down by the Taycan Turbo.
At 7:33.3, the Turbo S also beat the Model S Plaid by a few seconds to reclaim the EV record. In addition to the extra power available from the Turbo S, the car had a new performance kit and the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control system. These aren't aftermarket upgrades, meaning the lap time is official for a series production vehicle.
More From The Nurburgring
7:35.5
It wasn't long after Tesla announced the upgraded Model S Plaid that rumors of a Nurburgring record attempt surfaced. The rumors were fueled by Model S sightings at the track in 2021, putting its tri-motor powertrain with 1,020 horsepower to the test.
And the rumors were ultimately true. The sizable sedan recorded an official lap time of 7:35.5—falling short of expectations for a low 7-minute run but still enough to beat the Taycan Turbo. For a little while, anyway.
7:42.3
Launching in 2019 for the 2020 model year, the Taycan Turbo is Porsche's first modern EV. And it's an impressive debut, wielding 616 horsepower in normal operation or 671 ponies with overboost activated. Porsche lists a 0-60 mph time of 3.0 seconds flat. And this is the ""base"" model Taycan.
While technically the slowest Porsche Taycan at the Nurburgring, it's still plenty fast. The automaker clocked an official time of 7:42.3 with a preproduction model back in 2019, matching the previous-generation BMW M4 CS. That's not bad for a beefy electric four-door sedan.
7:44.8
In the early 2010s, this one-off electric sports car was making waves. Developed and built in Finland by the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, it first attacked the Nurburgring in 2011, but couldn’t quite break the 8-minute barrier. The group wasn’t done trying.
Pumping out 400 horsepower through a quad-motor powertrain, the team returned in 2015 and Sport Auto drove it for a properly quick 7:44.8 lap. At the time it was an EV record for a street-legal car, though being a one-off, it obviously couldn’t claim production status.
7:45.5
We haven't seen much of Kia or Hyundai at the Nurburgring, at least with regards to lap times. The South Korean conglomerate has a plethora of EVs on sale now or coming soon, and the Ioniq 5 N is decidedly aimed at fans of performance. With up to 641 horsepower available in short spurts with the N Grin Boost function (N for Nurburgring, obviously), there's plenty of power to go fast.
The N treatment doesn't simply add power, as the folks from the German publication Sport Auto—who accomplished the lap—found out. Bigger brakes, lower suspension, and sticky tires contributed to an impressive 7:45.5 lap time with driver Christian Gebhardt behind the wheel.
7:56.2
Long before the letters EQ were synonymous with electric Mercedes vehicles, there was the SLS AMG Electric Drive. With gullwing doors and a day-glo paint job, the supercar was impossible to miss. And when it debuted in 2012, it backed up those good looks with 738 horsepower. A 60.0-kilowatt-hour battery powered four electric motors, sending the 4,700-pound car to 60 mph in less than four seconds.
A timed lap around the Nordschleife followed in 2013, sending the electric SLS under the eight-minute mark. Unfortunately, the battery only had enough power to make one full-power lap, and under normal driving conditions, the range was barely 120 miles. Around 100 were initially planned for production, but only nine were made.
8:09.0
It's hard to believe the Audi R8 E-Tron debuted 15 years ago. Back then, it was a pre-production supercar known best for its appearance in the Iron Man movie franchise. But it wasn't just a pretty face, utilizing a dual-motor powertrain with a 49.0-kilowatt-hour battery generating 376 horsepower and 605 pound-feet of torque. It doesn't sound like much these days, but in 2012, that was enough to give the R8 E-Tron the EV Nordschleife record with a lap time of 8:09.
The R8 E-Tron became a proper production car in 2015, but the run was short-lived. Less that 100 were ultimately built before Audi pulled the plug just one year later, leaving space for other E-Tron models to follow. Ironically, none of those have made official Nurburgring lap attempts.
9:01.34
Peugeot was a player in the early days of the modern EV era with the EX1 concept. Unlike concepts from Audi or Porsche, Peugeot had no illusion about sending this to production. A tiny two-seater with an open cockpit, it relied on a lightweight design with a dual-motor powertrain generating just 335 horsepower.
In 2011, that was enough for Peugeot to claim a Nurburgring record for EVs. The lap time of 9:01.34 was far from competitive in the combustion segment, but it outclassed the Mini E's 2010 lap by nearly a full minute.
9:52.0
In the infancy of electrification, Mini debuted the E prototype—a gas-converted Cooper with a modest 201 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque. The skunkworks project eventually led to the production BMW i3, but not before a go ‘round the ‘Ring.
In 2010, Thomas Jagr completed a lap of the Nordschleife behind the wheel of the Mini E Racer in 9:52. It was the first EV ever to complete a timed lap of the Nurburgring, and while it isn’t holding on to any records these days, a sub-10-minute time for a fledgling technology was impressive nonetheless.",Christopher Smith
The Hyundai ST1 Is An Electric Work Van With Futuristic Styling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712338/hyundai-st1-work-van-reveal/,It looks like it traveled back from the future to do work.,2024-12-25 08:54:48,"And now for something completely different from Hyundai – a fully electric work van that looks like it has traveled back from the future. The ST1 sounds like the name of a trim level for a Ford Fiesta ST (RIP) or Focus ST sold in Europe. However, this alphanumeric designation denotes a purpose-built lineup of workhorses bundled as ""Service Type 1"" vehicles.
In typical Hyundai fashion, this initial reveal is only about the exterior design, with no details about technical specifications. We do know the ST1 is exclusively electric and has been developed to cater to small businesses in South Korea. It will be offered as a regular cargo van, a refrigerated van, and as a basic chassis cab for owners to retrofit the type of equipment they need.
Hyundai says it worked with local delivery companies to find out what they need from a work van. Riding on steelies and fitted with unpainted bumpers, the workhorse has a futuristic front-end design derived from the Staria minivan or the Kona small crossover. The main headlights are mounted unusually low while the full-width horizontal strip above is presumably for the daytime running lights.
The ST1 is tailored to those who need a more spacious van than what the Staria Load can offer and has chunky plastic cladding all around to protect the body. Much like on the Kona EV, the charging port is mounted at the front, to the right of what appears to be a small air intake. Hyundai likely had a good reason to put the front camera on the painted section of the bumper instead of moving it lower to blend it with the black plastic.
Hyundai says it developed the ST1 with the intent to make it easier to load and unload cargo by lowering the ride height. Although it looks like a box on wheels, the front upper spoiler was conceived with aerodynamic efficiency in mind. Even the bulky garnish connecting the cabin to the cargo area was designed to provide better airflow.
Full details and pricing will be disclosed in the first half of 2024 before the ST1 hits the domestic market later this year. Hyundai intends to sell the workhorse in other regions after the ST1 goes on sale in Korea.

Speaking with the Italian press at an event held in Arese at the Alfa Romeo Museum, the company's head honcho says the design is locked in. They've been working on the car's styling for the last two years and we're being promised the result is nothing short of exceptional: ""What we designed is a bomb, we couldn’t finalize the style of this car without being absolutely in love with it. And now we are!""

The new Giulia will be built alongside the Stelvio SUV, with both vehicles to be manufactured at the factory in Cassino. Alfa Romeo told us the Stelvio will be the first to go on sale at some point in 2025, followed about a year later by its sedan counterpart. We asked Imparato how Stellantis is going to separate the new Giulia from the Charger. Alfa Romeo's head honcho told us the STLA Large platform offers great flexibility in terms of overall length, wheelbase, width, height, etc.
It remains to be seen whether the next Giulia will stick to the traditional three-box sedan formula or will adopt a swoopy fastback silhouette as previously hinted at by company officials. If the latter is what Alfa Romeo has in mind, the shape could echo other Stellantis products like the Peugeot 4008 and Citroën C5 X.
Although there have been reports about Giulia and Stelvio going electric-only, that's not true. The STLA Large platform has been conceived to accommodate both combustion engines and electric drivetrains—as demonstrated on the new Dodge Charger. Consequently, the two Alfa Romeo models will come with ICE and EV power, plus a combination of both with a hybrid setup.

By 2027, Alfa Romeo will have electric versions of all models. The Milano small crossover will get the ball rolling on April 10, the Giulia and Stelvio will get zero-emission setups in the next couple of years, and a bigger SUV could follow in the latter half of the decade. Alternatively, Imparato suggested it might be a large aero-optimized sedan, but a final decision won't be taken until the end of this year. Whichever model gets the green light, it won't go on sale before 2028.
Alfa's top brass also touched on reviving the Duetto moniker for a compact electric car, potentially a coupe and/or a convertible: ""Alfa Romeo is the only brand that is capable of making a car costing €30,000 up to €2 million. You can't just make up a Duetto. But if you make a C-segment [car] you can make a Coupe or Spyder version that would be a great thing to do. The sound of silence.""
If we look at the sales numbers, Alfa Romeo is on the right track as shipments grew by 30 percent in 2023. Since the entry-level Milano is hitting dealers later this year, 2024 is shaping up to be an excellent year as well. With the new Stelvio (2025) and Giulia (2026) coming along, the second part of the decade could see Alfa blossom into a true rival for the German trifecta.
When FCA and PSA merged, Stellantis promised to keep all 14 brands underneath its corporate umbrella by investing for 10 years. Alfa Romeo received a major cash influx to revamp its lineup, and the same is happening to other troubled Italian brands such as Maserati, Fiat, Lancia, and Abarth. Even the French luxury marque DS Automobiles is sticking around for the time being.

Mercedes-Benz Might Finally Bring the V-Class Name To America,https://www.motor1.com/news/711983/mercedes-electric-van-v-class-us/,It goes on sale in 2026.,2024-12-25 08:54:51,"When Mercedes-Benz brings its next-generation van to America, it’ll reportedly wear the V-Class name. Unnamed Mercedes officials confirmed to WardsAuto that the model would drop the EQV nomenclature when it goes on sale in 2026.
Mercedes detailed its van plans in May 2023, announcing the VAN.EA architecture that’ll underpin new mid-size luxury vans in the US and elsewhere. According to this latest report, Mercedes will offer the van with single- and dual-motor setups in rear- and all-wheel drive configurations and two battery capacities.
Mercedes declined to comment on WardAuto's report when reached by Motor1, telling us it cannot discuss future product plans.
Mercedes said last year the vans would have a targeted range of over 310 miles. Like most vans on the market, the company will offer it in a variety of wheelbases and seating configurations. The platform will also underpin larger cargo vans built for customizability.
Additionally, the platform will underpin mid- and full-size camper vans to entice buyers. It’ll compete with the ID. Buzz California Camper variant Volkswagen announced in 2021, set to reach dealerships sometime after 2025.
Mercedes previously offered the Metris in the US, but dismal sales killed the model at the end of 2023. Lackluster demand didn’t stunt the brand’s enthusiasm for offering vans in the US, though. Hopefully they'll be a bit more successful this time around.

"The Most Expensive Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Costs $286,845",https://www.motor1.com/news/711962/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-configurator/,"The Turbo GT's configurator is already live. Unlike other Porsche models, there aren't many options to up-spec the pricey Turbo GT.",2024-12-25 08:54:52,"The latest iteration of the Porsche Taycan is here, and it doesn't hold anything back. Billed as the most powerful production model in Porsche's history, the Turbo GT delivers a 1,092-horsepower kick in the butt, albeit for a few seconds in Attack Mode. It's not just a straight-line scorcher either, having set new lap records for production EVs at Laguna Seca and the Nürburgring in range-topping Weissach Package trim. Thanks to Porsche's new configurator, we get to see exactly how many extras the Turbo GT has in store.
After spending a few minutes playing with the configurator, we've come to the conclusion that it's not what you can get on the Turbo GT, but rather, what you can't. We've grown accustomed to complex Porsche configurators overflowing with options that occasionally add nearly $100,000 to the sticker price. Here, the options list is surprisingly short. But that doesn't mean it's cheap. We came up with $54,850 in extras, with one option accounting for more than half of the upcharges.
That pricey feature is Porsche's Paint To Sample Plus, available through the company's  Exclusive Manufaktur program. For $30,020, you can choose a custom color applied to the Taycan right from the factory. Otherwise, there are five no-cost color choices, including the lovely Purple Sky Metallic launch color shown above. Volcano Grey Metallic, Shade Green Metallic, White, and Black are your other choices. Pale Blue Metallic, lifted from the 911 Dakar, is $2,850. For our purposes of finding the most expensive Taycan Turbo GT on the planet, we opt for the Paint To Sample Plus in a handsome blue.
We also choose the not-so-handsome Full Taycan Design Wrap for $11,400, adding bold branding on either side with big ol' stripes cascading over the car. Frankly, the much smaller Taycan Exterior Decal Set for $1,210 looks better, but with an unlimited budget, we prefer to throw taste out the window.
Those two options take us most of the way to the $54,850 upcharge. More exterior tweaks like painted exterior mirrors, painted wheels, black door handles, and black badges add $2,570. An illuminated Porsche logo in the taillight strip is $460, and illuminated carbon fiber door sills with bespoke lettering are $3,070. The GT Interior Package with Voltage Blue accents is a $940 bump, and other features like snazzy pedals and custom-colored owner manuals are factored in, too.
That takes the Turbo GT's price to an eye-watering $284,845. But if we're truly checking every box, we must include the Porsche Experience Center Delivery. For $2,000, you can pick up your car from Porsche in either Atlanta or Los Angeles and have a VIP experience in the process. That takes us to the final price of $286,845.

Mercedes Will Keep Making Its Cheapest Gas Car Because EVs Are Still Expensive,https://www.motor1.com/news/711863/mercedes-a-class-production-extended/,"The A-Class was supposed to be retired in 2024, but not anymore.",2024-12-25 08:54:54,"Mercedes has been overly optimistic about the rise in popularity of electrified vehicles, claiming hybrids and EVs would account for 50 percent of its sales by 2025. However, that's unlikely to happen since the new goal for 2024 is to reach just 21 percent of total shipments. Facing the harsh reality, the German luxury marque will no longer kill off its cheapest gasoline car this year.
The A-Class was supposed to bow out in 2024 but now it has had its life cycle extended well into 2026, according to Autocar. Not sold in the United States, the compact hatchback is effectively the entry point into the Mercedes lineup, kicking off at €37,401 (nearly $41,000) in its domestic market Deutschland. Last month, CEO Ola Kallenius admitted price parity between combustion engine cars and pure electric models is still ""many years away."" The executive went on to mention that customers can see that in the price gap between an ICE car and an EV.
Mercedes is working on a new family of compact cars and those too will have combustion engines. The CLA, CLA Shooting Brake, GLA, and GLB are all getting replacements on a newly developed MMA platform that will support gas engines as well as entirely electric drivetrains. The company hasn't said a word about whether the A-Class hatchback, A-Class sedan, and the B-Class minivan will be renewed. We do know there are plans for a ""Little G"" SUV on this new architecture.
Mercedes thinks plug-in hybrids and EVs will represent up to 50 percent of total shipments by 2030. It's a big change compared to a projection made a couple of years ago when the firm said it would be completely electric in some markets by the end of the decade. Based on the newly established targets, we can deduce the company intends to keep making cars with gasoline engines in the 2030s as a response to a weaker-than-expected adoption of EVs.
In a document prepared for investors, the Stuttgart-based automaker says it's ""taking the necessary steps to go all electric"" but recognizes that ""customers and market conditions will set the pace of the transformation."" In other words, if you want to buy a gas car in 2031 with the famed three-pointed star, Mercedes will happily oblige.
There are signs the European Union's sales ban on new cars with emissions in 2035 might not actually come into effect. Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke recently said there are ""a lot of discussions right now around the end of the combustion engine. I think it could be delayed."" If that happens, which wouldn't come as a big shock, the ICE age will be prolonged.

Watch Porsche Reveal The Taycan Turbo GT: Livestream,https://www.motor1.com/news/711870/porsche-taycan-turbo-gt-debut-livestream/,The livestream starts at 9 AM Eastern / 1 PM GMT.,2024-12-25 08:54:54,"Update: The livestream is over and the Taycan Turbo GT is here! Read all about it in our debut post packed with information and photos of this very potent EV.
The New Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: This Is It
The ""most dynamic Taycan of all time"" will go official later today as a more powerful version of Porsche's hot EV. Likely to gain the ""Turbo GT"" suffix, the high-performance electric sedan will have the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire in its crosshairs. It already has a feather in its cap by setting a Nürburgring lap record for purely electric models.
Porsche has been tight-lipped about the Taycan Turbo GT but the spy shots of virtually undisguised prototypes running around the 'Ring revealed a more aggressive body. The comprehensive aero package will include that look-at-me rear wing and more subtle tweaks for better airflow. The engineers from Zuffenhausen might have put the Taycan on a diet before sending it to the gym to build some muscle. It's a logical assumption since the Cayenne Turbo GT also got more power and lost weight.
We'll have to wait and see whether those rumors about a third motor will pan out, but even without it, combined output is likely to hit four digits, at least with a boost function. Look for neck-snapping acceleration since adding power while removing weight will likely enable a 0 to 60 mph run in the low two-second range. Odds are we're going to see the most powerful production Porsche ever, although a temporary title since the Mission X supercar has high chances of entering production.
Let's face it – the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT won't save our fragile planet with its electric drivetrain. The intent here is to show an EV can be more than just absurdly quick in a straight line. It can be fun to drive around a track despite what will certainly still be a lofty curb weight. Driving it at full tilt is going to drain the battery at a much higher rate but that's a sacrifice owners will be willing to make.
As to how much it’s going to cost, a 2025 Taycan Turbo S is already an eye-watering $210,995. Porsche is likely to charge at least an extra $20,000 for the new crown jewel of the lineup. With options, you'll likely end up spending a quarter of a million dollars.

How The Lunar Rover Batteries Worked—And Nearly Failed—On The Moon,https://www.motor1.com/features/711447/how-lunar-rover-batteries-work/,EV batteries hate extreme temps. So how did NASA build an electric rover that worked in outer space?,2024-12-25 08:54:56,"When manufacturers develop new powertrains, they frequently test them in the most extreme conditions on Earth. For example, the all-electric Rolls Royce Spectre was subjected to temperatures as low as -40F (-40C)  and as high as 122F (50C), so engineers could determine how its range would hold up in extremes. This harsh-climate exposure is crucial for BEVs, as batteries lose a lot of efficiency in freezing or scorching temperatures.
There is no climate on Earth, however, that compares to the intensity of the Moon. 250 degrees F (120C) during the day, -200 degrees F (-130C) at night, and that’s in the Moon’s temperate zones. So how did NASA manage to build an electric Moon rover that could operate in such extreme conditions, all the way back in the 1970s?
Although a Moon mission vehicle was in the works from the very beginning of the Apollo program, the first Moon rover—officially known as the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV)—wasn’t launched until the fourth manned Moon landing, Apollo 15, in 1971. The end goals for the LRV were simple: increase the area astronauts could explore, and help carry Moon rocks back to the lunar lander.
Spaceflight has a way of making simple demands challenging to meet, however.
The need to reduce the LRV’s weight required incredibly high-tech construction. Liberal use of aluminum and titanium got the LRV’s curb weight down to just 460 pounds, or roughly half that of a typical golf cart; Despite this, its payload was more than 1,000 pounds. It had to be foldable to stow on the lunar landing module; When launch-ready, it folded down to just 20 inches thick. It had zinc-plated, woven steel mesh wheels that could deform and spring back into shape, rather than pop or bend, to avoid blowouts on craggy rocks. Engineers gave it independent four-wheel-drive and four-wheel-steering for maximum traction and maneuverability.
Power demands were minimal, as the LRV would weigh just 76 pounds in the lighter gravitational field of the Moon. As such, it had just 1 total horsepower (.75 kilowatts), supplied via four quarter-horsepower series-wound DC motors (one at each wheel). Each motor had its own harmonic drive with an 80:1 gear reduction, to improve torque and response. The motor casings were pressurized to 7.5 PSI to prevent dust from entering the housings and ruining the brushes. Its official top speed was 8 MPH, although it cracked 11 MPH during Apollo 17 when astronaut Eugene Cernan floored it down a hill with a full payload of Moon rocks.
Originally, the budget for the LRV was just $19 million; cost overruns put the final tab at $38 million, making it the worst dollar-per-horsepower deal in history.
Because the LRV was low-power, it demanded a light, compact battery pack, rather than a large high-capacity one. Since it was intended to be a single-use machine (all three LRVs ever taken to the Moon are still parked on it), the batteries also didn’t need to be rechargeable. As such, a pair of 36V, 4.1-kilowatt-hour silver-zinc batteries were used—a far cry from the 80+ kWh battery packs of modern cars. Silver zinc batteries are only minimally rechargeable, lasting anywhere from 10-50 cycles. However, they possessed the highest energy density of any battery in existence prior to the development of lithium cells, at around 220 Wh/kg (vs. modern lithium-ion’s 270 Wh/kg). For single-use applications, they were unbeatable in the 1970s. As a result, silver-zinc served as the gold standard for aerospace batteries in both the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
Total usable range from the pair of batteries was rated at 57 miles during normal operation, with one battery powering the front wheels, and one powering the rear. The twin-battery design was built for redundancy, so if one battery died, the other could still power the entire LRV. This reduced safe usable range. NASA planners also wouldn’t allow astronauts to drive the LRV further away from the lander than they could walk, in case of a complete breakdown. This limited it to a six-mile radius of operations. The furthest an LRV was ever driven on a single mission was the final manned Moon landing, Apollo 17, where astronauts covered roughly 22 miles during the three-day expedition (including one continuous 12-mile drive).
In a decades-later interview with Wired, astronaut (and rover driver) Charles Duke recalled that on Apollo 16, despite driving the LRV over 15 miles, “we didn't even come close to running out of power.”
Temperature control was, unexpectedly, challenging. Silver zinc batteries perform poorly in cold temperatures, but the LRV was only intended for use during the 15-Earth-day-long lunar daytime, which meant that keeping them from overheating was the primary concern. The lunar surface itself can reach temperatures hotter than boiling water during these fortnight-long days, but since the Moon has no atmosphere, local temperatures vary wildly and are primarily determined by time spent directly in sunlight. The battery’s maximum operating temperature was rated at 125F (52C) and maximum survival temperature was 140F (60C), which it would rapidly exceed if exposed to broad daylight for too long.
This was easily solved during transit: the LRV was stored folded flat on the outside of the lunar lander. The lander would slowly rotate like a rotisserie chicken as it orbited the Moon, evenly distributing direct sunlight to each side, keeping temperatures manageable. On the surface of the Moon, however, there was no hiding from the rays of the sun, and the batteries would rapidly exceed their 140F limit.
To solve this, both batteries were given passive radiators. Rather than using a traditional active liquid cooling system, engineers used fused-silica mirrors to reflect as much light—and remove as much heat—as physically possible. When the LRV was moving, the mirrors would be covered with a dust shield, to prevent the extremely fine lunar soil from coating the mirrors, which would ruin their ability to reflect light and radiate heat.
This worked… to an extent. On Apollo 15, short trips and a low Sun angle kept the batteries within normal temperatures, but on Apollo 16, the landing location had higher temperatures. Making matters worse, an early accident meant the LRV lost a fender. A rooster-tail of fine dust followed the rover everywhere it went, and it coated everything—including the mirrors. The batteries refused to cool off in between drives, even after removing the heat shields and brushing off the mirrors, as the lunar soil retained heat too efficiently. The batteries could be slightly cooled by parking the LRV in the shade, but if it stayed in the shade for too long, the extreme cold would kill other electrical components.
Mission Control had astronauts switch from one battery to the other for power supply, trying to let each one cool off for longer periods. Despite this, by the final excursion on the third day of Apollo 16, the LRV batteries exceeded their maximum survival temperature, reaching 143F (62C) by the end of the mission. Luckily, the LRV batteries worked fine despite the scorching temperatures, and no astronauts had to walk home. On Apollo 17, careful dust control and parking the LRV further away from the Lunar Landing Module—which radiated immense amounts of heat—kept battery temperatures within acceptable ranges.
While NASA has planned humanity’s return to the Moon with the Artemis project, there’s no official word on which car is going up next, although there are many contenders—one of which is an Ultium-powered, GM/Lockheed joint project. While the future of Ultium is still in the air, it’s likely whatever vehicle traverses the moon next will use lithium-ion batteries just like terrestrial EVs, with similar temperature management strategies. It’s probable the new rover will have remote-control capabilities, as well, like the NASA VIPER Moon rover probe set to launch later this year.
The one thing that engineers will still need to contend with, no matter what? Dust… dust never changes.

The New Rivian R2 Gets A Kitchen And A Rooftop Tent,https://www.motor1.com/news/711633/rivian-r2-accessories-features/,Other nifty features include a dual glovebox and a flashlight.,2024-12-25 08:55:07,"Rivian delivered an unexpected one-two punch yesterday at the unveiling of the R2 where it took everyone by surprise with the even smaller R3. However, the first order of business is to kick off deliveries of its long-awaited Tesla Model Y rival, but that won't happen until the first half of 2026. When it does eventually hit the streets, the R2 will be compatible with a series of nifty accessories.
Much like the bigger R1T pickup and R1S SUV, the latest entry in Rivian's growing lineup caters to outdoorsy people with a bunch of optional goodies. For example, the Travel Kitchen bundles a water tank, a cooler, an induction cooktop with additional storage and even a cookware set. Rivian will throw in some hanging lights for when you're cooking at night in the middle of nowhere.
Alternatively, the small kitchen can make way for a detachable cargo box with handles on the sides and tiny wheels to carry it around. It's good for items that would otherwise make a mess inside the car, kind of like a tiny portable pickup truck bed. The interior is also great at storing stuff since not only you can fold flat the rear bench but also both front seats. Oh, and there's a front trunk as well.
What else? The cargo box on the roof is nothing to write home about but Rivian can swap it for a so-called Treehouse. It's a boxy rooftop tent that comes bundles with a ladder for ease of access. Installed at the rear, the bike mount is hooked up to the R2 without having to use tools and it can store two bikes. While some cars have built-in umbrella holders in the driver's door, the electric SUV uses that space for a flashlight.
Although undoubtedly an interesting EV, the new Rivian R2 will sadly take its sweet time to hit the market. It’s especially true in Europe (including the UK) where it won't go on sale until 2027. In the United States, prices will start at around $45,000 but you'll be paying more for these accessories. Logic tells us the Euro version will be more expensive given the value-added tax (VAT).
There's An Even Smaller Rivian On The Way;",Adrian Padeanu
BMW Might Make Gas And Electric M3s At The Same Time,https://www.motor1.com/news/711596/bmw-m3-ice-and-electric/,A new report says that reduced regulatory pressure has allowed the German automaker to pursue two very different drivetrains.,2024-12-25 08:55:08,"BMW is in the process of electrifying its entire lineup. It's safe to assume, then, that the M3, its flagship sports sedan, will lose its internal combustion engine in the near future. Indeed, that seems to have been the plan not long ago, however now a report indicates some changes behind the scenes. A new ICE M3 is reportedly on the way, and it will exist alongside an electric model.
There's a lot of interesting details in BMW Blog's report. It claims the electric and ICE M3 will reportedly not share a platform, for instance. The report also says the M4 coupe will also allegedly be electric only. In other words, the sedan may be the only option for those who want straight-six power.
The plan, says BMW Blog, is to use the current 3.0-liter S58 engine for the next car, as it will still be emissions-compliant. This means power output in the neighborhood of 500 horsepower or more, but it's very unlikely the new car will have a manual transmission. BMW M's brass seems eager to get rid of pesky clutch pedals as soon as they can.
BMW has shown us a quad-motor electric M car before, but we've heard nothing since a short teaser was released several months ago. At that time, it was likely that the German automaker thought this would be the only drivetrain offered in a potential new M3, however reduced regulatory pressure has reportedly changed the picture.
Several countries have pushed back ICE bans, and stringent emissions regulations have been hit with loopholes or watered down entirely. The European Union carved out a provision that allows ICE cars to be powered by synthetic fuels, for instance. It's also been reported that upcoming EPA regulations have been cut back following pressure from the automotive industry.
With all of this in mind it makes sense BMW will still offer an ICE-powered M3, especially if it's using the same engine as the current generation. All of this should be taken with a grain of salt, of course, but it could mean that internal combustion's relevance, at least in terms of performance cars, could last well into the 2030s.

Rivian's New Battery Cell Could Be Even Better Than Tesla's,https://www.motor1.com/news/711578/rivian-r2-battery-cells-details/,The new Rivian R2 SUV features huge cylindrical batteries which are even larger than the advanced 4680 cells used by Tesla.,2024-12-25 08:55:10,"Rivian surprised everyone today by not only revealing the hotly-anticipated R2 SUV at a starting price of just $45,000, but also showing us another car, the R3, as well as a new battery cell that underpins both cars. The cell is called the 4695 due to its diameter of 46 millimeters and height of 95 millimeters. Its specs have yet to be detailed, but it's considerably larger than Tesla's 4680 cells, which could mean a lot.
As battery cells get bigger their voltage does not change unless the chemistry changes, and Rivian is more likely than not using conventional lithium-ion chemistry. What does increase is the cell's rating in amp-hours, which translates into a 4695 holding more energy than a 4680. But there's more.
Larger cells can typically charge and discharge at higher rates. In short, this means the R2 will likely be able to charge faster and offer more peak power than if it got its juice from a slightly slimmer pack made of 4680s. The car's regenerative braking can also be stronger, which may offer efficiency gains.
Rivian is not the first to get into the 4695 game. BMW recently revealed samples of a 4695 cell it plans to use in its Neue Klasse of EVs from 2025 onwards. Indeed, several battery manufacturers are now producing cells in this 46mm form factor, including Samsung SDI, Panasonic, and LG.
We don't know the exact specs of these new 4695 cells, but we can do a little bit of guestimation about the pack's specs based on images Rivian showed us at the reveal.
Zooming in on the pack, it appears to consist of 3 large modules separated by heavy internal frame rails. Each module is 34 cells wide by 8 deep, for a total content of 272 cells. If we're talking lithium-ion and we assume the cells are all wired in series, we get a module voltage of 979.2V (nominal). That's a 1000V architecture, not 800V as speculation might otherwise indicate.
With three of these modules wired in parallel, the voltage will remain the same but the current available will go up considerably. We don't know what the individual cell ratings are, but other 4695s are capable of pulse discharging at up to 10C, or ten times their rated capacity in amp-hours. This could mean available power as high as 900kW, or around 1,200 horsepower. The Rivian's 4695s likely err on the side of capacity, though, so such high discharge rates are unlikely.
Once the electric automaker unveils the total capacity of the pack, that sort of information can be extrapolated. For now, just know that these new battery cells will likely enable performance on par if not greater than what Tesla is capable of in cars like the Model Y. How efficiently the rest of the drivetrain uses this energy is going to matter in terms of real-world performance, but the kilowatt-hours are there for the taking.

That said, the Charger Daytona is surprisingly efficient.",2024-12-25 08:55:12,"The Dodge Charger goes electric with the new Daytona model, but it is still unashamedly a muscle car. At a preview event for the Charger Daytona, Dodge head Tim Kuniskis told gathered media ""I don’t care. This is about performance,"" when asked about range and efficiency.
""Muscle car owners don’t care about fuel economy,"" he added. That said, the EPA range figures for the Charger Daytona are solid. The Charger Daytona R/T promises a 317-mile range from its 100.5-kWh gross (93.4-kWh net) battery pack, while the more powerful Scat Pack should do 260 miles on a full charge. Your milage may obviously vary – especially if you take advantage of the Daytona's donut mode – but that's an average figure of 3.4 miles/kWh for the R/T and 2.78 mi/kWh for the Scat Pack. Not bad for vehicles that weigh 5,838 pounds and offer 496 and 670 horsepower, respectively.
Charging rate is impressive too. The Charger Daytona uses a 400-volt electrical architecture, which usually translates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW, but it seems like it uses the trick of virtually splitting the battery pack into two virtual units charging in parallel, boosting speeds. The maximum rate of 183 kW is achievable at 350-kW stations.
So maybe Dodge didn't care about range or efficiency, but accidentally made an efficient car with a respectable range. All the more impressive given the power, size, and huge weight of the thing.
But we have to agree with Kuniskis here. We doubt muscle-car buyers will care.

Volkswagen Sued Twice As Felicity Ace Cargo Ship Fire Might Have Started From A Porsche,https://www.motor1.com/news/711302/vw-lawsuit-felicity-ace/,Plaintiffs claim a battery from a Porsche sparked the fire.,2024-12-25 08:55:13,"In February 2022, the Felicity Ace cargo ship caught fire and ultimately sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Some 4,000 cars perished in the fiery incident, most of which were new vehicles from various Volkswagen Group brands. But the drama isn't over; the German juggernaut is facing not one but two lawsuits.
Bloomberg reports that VW Group has been sued twice over allegations the fire started from a lithium-ion battery pack inside a Porsche that was on its way to a customer. Felicity Ace caught fire near the Azores archipelago while carrying an estimated $155 million worth of high-end cars, including 1,110 Porsches. Plaintiffs claim one of those cars sparked the fire that subsequently generated a veritable cartastrophe.
One of the lawsuits was filed in a court in Stuttgart where Porsche calls home. The lawsuit is led by the cargo ship's operator, Mitsui OSK Lines, and Felicity Ace's insurer, Allianz. Interestingly, this lawsuit was filed over a year ago, but its progression has been halted due to mediation talks for a second lawsuit in a Brunswick court, located in Lower Saxony, Germany.
Additional discussions between the involved parties are scheduled for later this month. If a settlement is not reached, the lawsuits will resume. According to documents related to the initial 2023 lawsuit, the plaintiffs accuse VW of withholding information about the risks associated with transporting electrified cars. Moreover, the lawsuit filed in the Stuttgart court alleges that VW failed to disclose the necessary precautions for safely transporting the cars.
Bloomberg reports the fire started from a Porsche EV, which can only be the Taycan. However, it's worth noting the automaker also sells a variety of Cayenne and Panamera versions with plug-in hybrid powertrains that have smaller battery packs. Parent company VW has confirmed the two lawsuits while Mitsui OSK Lines and Allianz refused to comment on the matter.
Attached below is an incomplete list of the VW Group cars that perished that day. There were also many privately owned vehicles that went under together with Felicity Ace. Notable mentions include a 2015 Ford Mustang GT, a Porsche 718 Boxster GTS 4.0, a 2007 BMW 750i, and even a JDM-spec 1996 Honda Prelude SiR. In addition, there was a 1977 Land Rover Santana, which was built in Spain under license from Land Rover by using complete knock-down kits of the Defender.
As a reminder, Lamborghini had to restart production of the Aventador to replace the 15 Ultimae units lost on the burned and sunken cargo ship.

2025 Tesla Roadster: Everything We Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/710485/tesla-roadster-speed-horsepower-range-price/,It’s been a long time coming—but the new Roadster might finally be on the way.,2024-12-25 08:55:15,"The second-generation Tesla Roadster debuted way back in November 2017. But it’s still not for sale, as the brand continues to work on the project. The latest statements from CEO Elon Musk indicate that deliveries could begin in 2025, and he touts some impressive—bordering on unbelievable—stats for the new model.
We’ll have to wait and see if the new Roadster actually debuts this year and if those 2025 delivery targets will come true. Until then, here’s everything we know about the electric sports car ahead of its debut.
The Roadster was Tesla’s first model ever, with production running from 2008 through 2012. But at that time it was just a Lotus Elise with batteries and it had a relatively limited production run. Tesla sold just over 2,400 models in its five-year production run.
Five years later the company announced a second-generation model was under development. Elon even showed a concept of the vehicle’s design. At that time, Musk claimed the new Roadster was able to reach 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds, with a top speed of over 250 miles per hour and a 620-mile range. Prices started at $200,000, and deliveries were supposed to begin in 2020.
There have been several reports about the second-gen Roadster’s powertrain over the years, and it has evolved in that time. The latest reports indicate that the Roadster may have a 200.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack and three electric motors—one up front and two on the rear. That would give the supercar well over 1,000 horsepower. Musk said that the Roadster would reportedly have 7,376 pound-feet of torque—but that number is misleading. It will probably have closer to 758 lb-ft.
In 2019, Musk said the sports car would be available with 10 rocket thrusters that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking, and cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly,"" according to the company boss. In 2021, Musk said the car would hit 60 mph in 1.1 seconds with the optional rockets.
During a 2021 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Musk went into more detail about the flying Roadster. ""I thought maybe we could make it hover, but not too high,"" he said. ""So maybe it could hover, like, a meter above the ground, or something. So, if you plummet, you blow out the suspension, but you’re not going to die.""
CEO Elon Musk claims the Tesla Roadster will be able to hit 60 miles per hour in less than one second. On February 28, 2024, he posted new details about the second-generation Roadster on X with the claim. He also wrote, ""Tonight, we radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster. There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""
To put this acceleration into perspective, the Rimac Nevera set a production-car record in 2023, reaching 60 mph in 1.74 seconds. Students in Switzerland built an open-wheel EV that hit 60 mph in 0.956 seconds but was far from a road-legal vehicle.
Rimac CEO Mate Rimac backed up Elon’s claim—somewhat—by saying that 0-60 mph in under one second ""is possible,"" but that ""thrusters are really the only way to go.""
The Tesla Roadster will reportedly have a top speed of over 250 miles per hour, a claim originally made in 2019.
Tesla has released multiple photos of the new Roadster and even put it on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Musk said the production design is complete in the recent series of tweets. Although, that statement might indicate that the final sports car might look different than in the earlier images.
The previous photos show a sports car that looks radically different from the first-gen Roadster. The new one has a sharp-edged, low-slung shape with pointy headlights. Rather than being a true convertible, there’s a removable roof panel over the occupants. Inside, the driver grips a steering yoke. A curved tablet between the seats handles the instrument and infotainment duties in a layout similar to other Tesla vehicles.
In the series of Tweets where Musk announced the sub-1 second 0-60-mph time, he also mentioned showing the final design at the end of the year and beginning deliveries in 2025. When the second-gen Roadster originally debuted in 2017, it was initially supposed to go on sale in 2020. Tesla has been pushing back the vehicle’s launch every year since then.
Since the 2017 debut, Tesla has maintained the new Roadster would start at $200,000, and there would be a $250,000 Founders Series version. There’s no info available yet about what the rocket-equipped version would cost—but it will likely be even pricier.
Until 2021, Tesla took $50,000 reservations for the new Roadster. At that time, the company removed the vehicle’s price from its site and stopped accepting bookings for the sports car.
In 2022, popular YouTuber Marques Brownlee released a video complaining about the new Roadster’s multiple delays. He was frustrated about Tesla announcing the model and then pushing back the introduction for years.

The New Karma Gyesera EV Already Looks Familiar,https://www.motor1.com/news/710942/karma-gyesera-debut-specs/,Karma's first electric sedan promises 250 miles of range.,2024-12-25 08:55:15,"This year marks Karma Automotive's 10th anniversary. With that the company debuted the Gyesera—an evolution of the GSe-6, a fully electric sedan revealed in 2021. The GSe-6 had a design reminiscent of the plug-in hybrid Revero launched in 2016, which superseded the short-lived Fisker Karma introduced in 2011.
But the Gyesera hopes to be more than just a remix. Karma President Marques McCammon told Automotive News that almost all body panels are new compared to the Revero. Only a section of the rear quarter panels has been carried over. Even still, the styling looks familiar. The body is made from a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber on a spaceframe chassis made from aluminum.
Changes have been made to about 85 percent of the car, added McCammon. Karma Vice President, Global Design Michelle Christensen goes as far as to say it's ""the most badass GT on the road."" The new Gyesera is 199.9 inches long, 78.9 inches wide, and 52.4 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 124.4 inches. To put those numbers into perspective, it's 3.9 inches longer and 1.6 inches wider than a Tesla Model S but rides 4.5 inches lower to the ground.
The rear-wheel-drive Karma Gyesera aims to deliver 590 horsepower and 693 pound-feet of torque to enable a 0-60 mph run in less than 4.2 seconds and a top speed of over 135 mph. The specs sheet reveals a curb weight of 5,300 pounds. Mind you, these are preliminary figures based on simulations and early testing, so the numbers could change until production starts. There's a 120.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for over 250 miles, but the range is also a projection.
Karma Automotive intends to start production before the end of this year but doesn't rule out an early 2025 market launch. The electric sedan will be a limited-run affair since only approximately 2,000 units will be made during a production run of four or five years.
It's going to cost between $175,000 and $225,000, according to Automotive News. That's going to make it a lot more expensive than a Tesla Model S (from $74,990), a Porsche Taycan (from $99,400), a Mercedes EQS (from $104,400), or an Audi E-Tron GT (from $106,500).
Introduced this weekend at the Amelia Island Concours, the Gyesera can already be preordered for $5,000. The new sedan follows last year's introduction of the Kaveya electric coupe slated to go on sale in the final quarter of 2025 as the brand's flagship car. Meanwhile, an updated plug-in hybrid Revero is expected to hit the assembly line in Q3 2024.

Hardcore Porsche Taycan Arrives March 11,https://www.motor1.com/news/710990/hardcore-porsche-taycan-teaser/,It's likely the hot version that lapped the Nurburgring in 7:07.,2024-12-25 08:55:17,"Porsche has officially started the countdown for its most hardcore Taycan yet. The world premiere is scheduled for March 11 when we'll discover the ""most dynamic Taycan of all time."" Marketing jargon aside, this hot electric sedan is likely a production version of a prototype that lapped Nordschleife in 7:07.55.
Having slashed 26 seconds from the Taycan Turbo S' lap time and 17.6 seconds from the Tesla Model S Plaid's hot lap of the Green Hell, the hardcore Taycan will be bloody fast. The new teaser image released today only shows a shadowy silhouette—but the car from the Nürburgring bared all. The big wing at the back will set it apart from the lesser derivatives, although we're sure Porsche has made other aero tweaks that we'll discover next week.
The most potent Taycan so far is the Turbo S with 938 horsepower, already a huge bump considering the old one had 750 hp. You can expect the future flagship to pack an even greater punch, possibly exceeding the 1,000-hp mark to match the Plaid with its monstrous 1,020-hp output. Neck-snapping acceleration is a given considering the new Turbo S already does 0 to 62 mph in just 2.4 seconds, down by 0.4s compared to the old Turbo S.
The car's name remains a mystery, although some are referring to the crown jewel as the Taycan Turbo GT. Another missing piece of the puzzle is the number of electric motors since various reports state Porsche's engineers are cramming a third motor. However, take these details with the proverbial pinch of salt.
A third motor would add weight to an already heavy car, although Zuffenhausen might try to offset the extra bulk by putting the electric sedan on a diet. For reference, a Taycan Turbo S weighs 5,082 pounds in the United States.
With the facelift introduced about a month ago, Porsche increased pricing across the lineup. The Taycan Turbo S is now $14,445 more expensive than before, kicking off at $210,995. It’s safe to assume the Turbo GT or whatever it'll be called is going to command a serious premium. Don't be too surprised if it'll cost roughly $250,000 or about the same as a Lucid Air Sapphire. An AMG EQS starts at $147,550 while the Plaid is a bargain by comparison, at $89,990. However, whether Tesla is a luxury brand or not, that's up for debate.

This Secret Ford F-150 Lightning Will Climb Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/710790/ford-f-150-lightning-demonstrator-pikes-peak/,It could be a modified version of the F-150 Lightning Switchgear we saw earlier this year.,2024-12-25 08:55:19,"During Ford's big party in Charlotte to kick off the 2024 racing season, company CEO Jim Farley revealed a new ""EV demonstrator"" would tackle Pikes Peak. Details on that vehicle weren't mentioned, and for the most part, they still aren't mentioned. However, we at least know it will be an F-150 Lightning. But it won't anything you'll see at the local Ford dealership.
Ford shared a single teaser image on social media on Friday, showing the front of a vehicle hiding under covers. It's low, wide, and there's a wild wing at the back like the one on the bonkers electric SuperVan. In fact, if Ford didn't specifically say this was an F-150 Lightning, our minds would jump directly to some SuperVan iteration beyond the current 4.2 model. But this is a truck, and clearly, Ford is applying some of the lessons learned from its supremely fast van.
This hillclimb racer could be a variation of the Lightning Switchgear, a one-off prototype designed to explore performance envelopes both on- and off-road for the electric truck. We got up close with the Switchgear back in January, taking a ride in the off-road version with Vaughn Gittin Jr. at the wheel. It's called Switchgear because the same truck – with small changes to the suspension and tires – is designed to tackle paved corners the same way it tackles dirt jumps.
Ford didn't make two versions of the Switchgear, however. The same prototype accommodates both roles, which means we only saw the off-road version in person. During the event, a Ford rep told us it would be converted at a later date, which would be convenient timing for Pikes Peak.
The above rendering comes from Ford's Switchgear press kit, showing how the street version should look. Obviously there are quite a few differences between this and the teaser, notably that big wing and what could be strakes from the cab to the back, not unlike what we see on the SuperVan. If this new Lightning demonstrator is based on Switchgear, Ford is certainly taking it to the extreme.
Whether it's related to Switchgear or something completely different, we suspect this F-150 will be pretty darned quick going up the hill. This year's Pikes Peak Hillclimb is June 23, so expect more on this amped-up Lightning between now and then.

"Mate Rimac Says 0-60 MPH In One Second 'Is Possible,' But There’s A Catch",https://www.motor1.com/news/710679/rimac-tesla-0-60-one-second/,"The Bugatti-Rimac CEO says Tesla's claim of 0-60 mph in under one second is possible, but it requires tons of power and very little weight.",2024-12-25 08:55:19,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a radical claim earlier this week about the upcoming Roadster supercar, saying the company is aiming for a 0-60 mph time of less than one second. While many have since dismissed the claim, he does have an ally in Bugatt-Rimac CEO Mate Rimac—sort of.
When asked on his Facebook page if he thought the under-one-second claim was believable, Rimac responded with a surprising yes. ""It is possible with thrusters,"" he says in the Facebook comment. ""We did the simulation.""
But there is a significant stipulation to go along with that confirmation.
""Problem is, you release the air in two to three seconds and then you have a lot of dead weight that you are carrying around (tanks, compressor, valves, nozzles etc.),"" Rimac continues. ""Same with fans—they just give you more grip but you need something like 30,000 newton-meters on the wheels to accelerate below one sec 0-100 km/h, which means you need massive motors, inverters, gearboxes, driveshafts, etc.""
Rimac also notes that the car has to be ""super light,"" which isn’t typically the standard for battery-powered cars. Even his Rimac Nevera hypercar—which will hit 60 mph in under 2.0 seconds—weighs over 5,000 pounds.
""So thrusters are really the only way to go,"" he says. ""But they bring a lot of downsides as well.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested in 2018 that the Roadster would have ""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around the car."" That, in theory, would be the type of thrust the Roadster needs to achieve that sub-one-second 0-60 time. Although, it’s unclear how that would fare with the NHTSA.
We’ll have to wait and see if Elon’s claims come true. The new Tesla Roadster will reportedly debut later this year.

Our Homemade Honda Motocompacto Type R Is A Little Too Fast,https://www.motor1.com/features/710479/honda-motocompacto-type-r-drive/,Maybe tripling the power was a bit much.,2024-12-25 08:55:21,"Haven’t you heard? We built our own Honda Motocompacto scooter. It’s dimensionally identical to the real thing and uses many legit Honda parts, but it’s a lot faster than stock. Or at least, it will be by the time this story ends. It’s a Motocompacto Type R.
If you haven’t read the first story, I recommend doing so before this one. This piece mostly covers the driving experience and related subjects. The other story details the building of the Motocompacto Type R; how we made the chassis; how we got a Motocompacto motor; how it all came together.
The first big item was getting a battery mounted in the scooter’s body. It’s a little narrow in there, but there’s otherwise plenty of space. The stock Motocompacto battery is a 36-volt (nominal) unit of around 250 watt-hours. That’s a nice capacity for a scooter, but I didn’t want to use it, not only because there’s likely a performance-limiting management system wired into it, but also because the assembly is around $300 from Honda, which is really expensive for a pack of that capacity. Instead I started with a battery I knew well: one ripped out of a Hoverboard.
These 36V packs can put out around 40 amps of current for a while before they get unhappy. They only contain 155Wh of energy, but the price is right at just $40. Full of 18650 cells, they’re a common choice for scooters, e-bikes, and other light electric vehicles. Their only real downside is they have pretty bad voltage sag under load, which effectively gives the scooter a little less power than if it were using a larger battery. All you need to know for now is that there are many fun ways to solve that problem which we’ll explore later.
I installed the hoverboard pack and wired up the throttle. Then, I routed the mechanical brake. Eventually, I want to get rid of this brake by utilizing very strong regen, but for now I figured I might as well put it in. When all of that was done I added the headlight. I used a sodium-ion 18650 cell to power it. I bought a bunch of sodium-ion batteries a while ago out of curiosity and decided to use one for this purpose. This is not the last time you’ll see them.
I weighed the scooter before riding it. At 37.2 pounds, it’s about 4 pounds lighter than the factory version. With that in mind, I set the current to 14 amps which would give me a stock amount of Motocompacto power. Having never built something this light before, I didn’t know what to expect in terms of acceleration.
And it was very slow. I haven’t driven a stock Motocompacto, but let’s just say I’m pleased that I’m able to alter this one’s output. At 490W, this thing could barely handle the gentle grade of my driveway. I guess that shouldn’t be surprising for ⅔ horsepower, but I was expecting more.
So I turned it up to one horsepower, which was a little better. At this amount of current, the stock scooter would blow its internal fuse. 745W was still not enough, though. I wanted this thing to take off and accelerate hard.
I went back into the garage and did a quick health check on the scooter, which meant I looked around to make sure nothing was smoking. Bad for people as well as electronics. Nothing was even warm, so I turned it up to 40 amps. That’s about the max these batteries are willing to provide and would give me 1,440W, which is about two horsepower.
When electric motors receive too much current they generally get hot and make a sort of TV static squealing noise, at least in my experience. If you’ve ever driven a turbocharged car that breaks up under boost, it kind of feels like that. You want it to go faster but it just isn’t having it.
Anyway, this one did that. At full throttle it really complained, the phase wires to the motor were getting warm, and the whole thing was generally not having a great time. In my experience, around 35A is really the end of the world for these kinds of small hub motors. So I turned it down to 35A and mellowed out the throttle curve. That made it just right.
I was really enjoying it, and on the way back to the garage it stopped accelerating very suddenly. As it turns out, the little clips used to keep the motor shaft from spinning had been sheared wide open by the newfound torque. The sudden jolt unplugged the motor from the rest of the scooter. I bent everything back into place and now it’s fine. I’ve since redesigned the clips. You can see how much weaker the old ones were. As a rookie scooter designer, I’ll take that one on the chin. As a side note, future runs will include a helmet.
The increased torque has also revealed that the tolerances on my front end are a little loose. When you go wide open, you can physically feel the fork trying to pull itself off the scooter. Maybe that part shouldn’t be plastic. Speed wobbles are a problem too, but I’m not sure if that’s specific to my design or more a result of the minuscule 29.2” wheelbase and very small amount of caster angle. Improvements are on the way in that department as well.
The whole reason I did this project is customizability, and you’ll be seeing more on that front. We’ll be able to change out the batteries, alter the “tune” on the drivetrain, and modify the hardware to get a better end product. Since we did this whole deal from the ground up, anything is possible.
I kinda wish I could’ve just bought a stock Motocompacto to do all of this, though. I understand the Honda isn’t supposed to be a dangerous toy with a hair-trigger throttle, but that should ultimately be up to the owner to decide. A lot of enthusiasts find electric vehicles unappealing because manufacturers lock them out of the tinkering and tuning process. That’s silly when altering the performance of an EV is as simple as a few keystrokes on a laptop. Maybe I’m drifting out of my lane here, but if you want people to like your toys, they have to be able to play with them. The Motocompacto in particular doesn’t even run at a deadly level of voltage.
Critiques aside, this thing is still fun to ride and surprisingly practical. Even without folding, it fits handily in the back of my car. The large square body also provides a lot of space inside for storage, or a rat’s nest of wiring in my case.
I think there are many potential modifications here, and as soon as the next piece of the puzzle arrives, the Motocompacto Type R will return. I want to do a top-speed run, but I need to mentally prepare myself for that and tighten up the steering. If you want to see anything else in particular, leave a comment and we’ll consider trying it. More riding footage is on the way, too. The weather has not been kind lately.

The New Renault 5 Gets Branded Merch Like This Rad Cassette Player,https://www.motor1.com/news/710553/renault-5-branded-merch/,There's also a slot car track and a foosball table.,2024-12-25 08:55:23,"There's more to the chic Renault 5 than its baguette holder and lipstick-shaped gear shifter. The French marque is pulling out all the stops to make the R5's revival more interesting with an online shop chock-full of branded merchandise, and some items are cool as hell.
The one that initially caught our attention was the cassette player, which was all the rage when the previous-generation Renault 5 launched. Made from aluminum and fitted with headphone and microphone jacks, the Player5 Portable Cassette Player has Bluetooth and a play/record function. The rechargeable battery lasts for up to 10 hours and Renault throws in a blank 60-minute cassette. Oh, you also get a pencil to rewind the tape—which is a sentence that only makes sense if you're past a certain age. All for €180, which works out to about $195 at current exchange rates.
You can also buy a nifty slot car race track that's nearly 150 inches long. It comes bundled with 1:43 scale models of the 2021 Renault 5 prototype that came before the production version and the rad Turbo 3E concept. Both have working headlights and a turbo function with a dedicated button on the controllers. It'll set you back €115 ($125).
Another product that we found interesting is a €200 ($217) helmet with built-in brake light and turn signals. Alternatively, you could go for a €110 ($119) set of three stainless steel balls to play a game of pétanque. Per Wikipedia:
""Players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball. In pétanque, the objective is to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent after all boules have been thrown.

Aside from miscellaneous items such as beanies, sweaters, socks, skateboards, pencils, pedal cars, and scale models of various sizes, there are a few pricey goodies. You can spend a cool €2,700 ($2,930) on a bicycle or €3,000 ($3,250) on a surfboard. Reach deeper into your pockets for a foosball table that costs a whopping €4,200 ($4,500). It's made by French football table manufacturer Bonzini and weighs 176 pounds (80 kilograms).
As for the car itself, Renault has said the reborn 5 will kick off at around €25,000 ($27,000). A more expensive hot hatch derivative will follow later this year when Alpine is going to introduce the A290.

Hyundai Kills All N Gasoline Performance Cars In Europe,https://www.motor1.com/news/710383/hyundai-retires-i20n-i30n-europe/,"Just like that, Hyundai's hot hatches are no more in Europe.",2024-12-25 08:55:24,"Pour one out for Hyundai's gasoline fun cars in Europe. In a statement made to Motor1 Deutschland, a spokesperson for the company's German division confirmed production of N models that feed on gasoline on the Old Continent will end during the first half of 2024. It effectively means the i20 N, i30 N, and the lesser-known i30 N Fastback are being axed. However, if you hurry, there might be a few available in stock.
""Hyundai Motor has decided to cease production of ICE N models for the European market during the first half of the year. This follows the brand's commitment to offer European customers a zero-emission product range by 2035 and to be 100 percent carbon neutral in all phases of car production and operation by 2045. In Germany, the versions of the i20 N and i30 N are still shown in the configurator on hyundai.de and will continue to be available in dealerships this year (until probably the end of the year depending on the numbers available in stock).""
Europeans never got the latest Veloster N or the Elantra N for that matter. The new-generation Kona has yet to receive the N treatment as the range currently tops out with the N-Line model. High-performance N models are not going away in other markets considering Hyundai has already confirmed plans for a new Elantra N sedan, possibly with a bigger engine. The demise of sporty ICE models in Europe won't spell the end for N since there's now a fully electric Ioniq 5 N, with a Ioniq 6 N rumored to arrive in the foreseeable future.
With emissions regulations getting stricter and taxation on gasoline cars increasing basically every year, it's no wonder Hyundai Europe is pulling the plug on conventionally powered N cars. These models haven't even been around for a long time taking into account the i30 N first came out in 2017, followed in 2018 by the i30 N Fastback and in 2020 by the i20 N.
The days of affordable ICE performance cars in Europe are sadly numbered. Volkswagen has already killed the up! GTI and Polo GTI while the latest Golf GTI doesn't have a manual gearbox anymore. The days of Opel's OPC cars and Peugeot's GTi models are long gone. In addition, Ford killed the Fiesta ST in 2023 and will also axe the Focus ST in 2025.
Europeans also had diesel performance cars from mainstream brands, but the Golf GTD and the oil-burner Octavia RS have recently been canned.

"Watch Ford's 1,400-HP SuperVan Blast Its Way To Several Lap Records At Bathurst",https://www.motor1.com/news/710151/ford-supervan-sets-new-course-record-at-mount-panorama/,The electric van is even quicker around the course than Mercedes' specially prepped AMG GT3.,2024-12-25 08:55:26,"The Ford SuperVan 4.2 EV chalked up a few more records to add to the one-off model's already impressive resume by setting a blistering pace around the Mount Panorama circuit this past weekend. It now holds the titles for the quickest closed-wheel vehicle, electric vehicle, and commercial model around the 3.85-mile course that hosts the Bathurst 500 race.
The SuperVan 4.2's record-setting lap was 1 minute and 56.3247 seconds. To put this time into perspective, Mercedes touted setting a new fastest time earlier during the Bathurst 500 festivities when a specially modified AMG GT3 went around the circuit in 1:56.605, 0.2803 seconds slower than Ford's electric van.
The SuperVan 4.2 was driven to the finish line by Two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Romain Dumas. He's no stranger to scoring achievements like this, including setting the fastest times at courses like the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Nürburgring Nordschleife, and Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb in the Volkswagen I.D. R.
Last year, Dumas and the SuperVan 4.2 set a new record in the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb's Open Class by completing the 12.5-mile course in 8:47.682 to beat the previous quickest time of 9:24.433. The company also went to the Goodwood Festival of Speed with the SuperVan 4.0.
The SuperVan 4.2 is an evolution of the earlier 4.0 version, with a new carbon-fiber front splitter and rear spoiler to increase downforce. The three electric motors – one at the front and two at the rear – make a total of over 1,400 horsepower. The design is based roughly on the Ford e-Transit Custom, but the overhauled rear with massive openings in the bodywork are unlike anything you'd see on the road.
The SuperVan 4.2 will also be on display at the Adelaide Festival of Speed from March 15 through 17. Then, it'll be at the Formula One Australian Grand Prix later in the month.
""We do have more plans for it, but for the time being, these are confidential, but you can be sure we have some exciting ideas,"" Ford Performance spokesperson Jay Ward told Motor1 in a statement.

BYD Brings Denza Brand To Europe With Striking D9 Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/710022/denza-d9-minivan-europe-debut/,It's available as a plug-in hybrid and EV with a seven-seat layout.,2024-12-25 08:55:27,"The 2024 Geneva Motor Show kicks off today, and while most international brands are missing, there are a handful of European debuts. This D9 minivan marks the launch of Denza on the Old Continent. If the name doesn't ring a bell, it's a brand created by Chinese automaker BYD and Mercedes in 2010. Initially, the joint venture was 50:50, but the German luxury brand reduced its share to 10 percent in 2021 when Denza underwent restructuring.
BYD is paving the way for Denza in Europe by bringing the D9, a large people mover with a high-end interior to rival another posh minivan—the Lexus LM. It's not a completely new model since it initially went on sale in China in 2022. Much like in the People's Republic, the Euro variant can be had as a plug-in hybrid or as a full EV.
The three-row family hauler has a boxy shape, large electrically operated sliding doors, a generous greenhouse, and two equally polarizing grille designs. The imposing front end is just as striking as other new minivans, including the Volvo EM90 / Zeekr 009 and the Toyota Alphard / Vellfire twins. The boxy shape with a nearly flat roofline maximizes interior space and there's a large panoramic sunroof to make the cabin feel more airy.
Even though it's showcasing the D9 in Geneva, Denza remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications for now. However, look no further than the Chinese version to discover all the relevant numbers. It's 206.7 in (5,250 mm) long, 77.2 in (1,960 mm) wide, and 75.6 in (1,920 mm) tall, with a massive wheelbase of 122.4 in (3,110 mm).
Since Denza wants to lure you away from buying that luxury SUV, the D9 has an upscale interior with leather just about everywhere you look. The cabin has a 2+2+3 configuration with adjustable and folding seats, not to mention ventilation and massaging functions. Aside from the usual pair of screens in the front, there are extra displays mounted on the armrests of the second-row seats to control various functions.
In addition, there's a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens, along with a small fridge that can hold as many as six bottles. The captain's chairs in the middle slide fore and aft, offering copious amounts of legroom, while the grab handle on the B-pillars makes it easier to get in and out. Even rearmost seats get USB ports and a central armrest, along with LED ambient lighting, and speakers from the Dynaudio sound system.
While Denza keeps European specifications shrouded in mystery for now, the D9 sold in China can be had as a plug-in hybrid with a turbocharged 1.5-liter gasoline engine. The PHEV model is available with front- and all-wheel drive, along with a 20.39-kWh battery and a bigger 40.06-kWh pack.
The combustion engine is good for 137 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque (231 Newton-meters)) while the front-mounted motor is rated at 228 hp and 251 lb-ft (340 Nm). Go for the all-wheel-drive model and Denza throws in a rear-mounted motor that produces 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm). The FWD versions have a combined output of 296 hp and 421 lb-ft (571 Nm), good for a sprint to 62 mph in 9.5 seconds. Step up to AWD models and you're rewarded with a healthy 401 hp and 502 lb-ft (681 Nm) to cut the sprint time to 7.9 seconds.
In China, the Denza D9 electric model is also offered with a choice of FWD and AWD. Both have a front motor with 308 hp and 266 lb-ft (360 Nm). Upgrading to the all-wheel-drive model brings a rear motor producing 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm) for a combined 369 hp and 347 lb-ft (470 Nm). The FWD variant takes 9.5 seconds to complete the sprint, or just 6.9 seconds if you go with AWD. Both share a 103.4-kilowatt-hour LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery pack.
As far as range is concerned, we should point out that the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) differs greatly from the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) used in Europe. The Denza D9 electric model with front-wheel drive promises to cover 385 miles (620 kilometers) while its all-wheel-drive counterpart can do 373 miles (600 kilometers). Maximum charging power is 166 kilowatts, in which case 15 minutes enables a driving range of 143 miles (230 kilometers).
The D9 isn't Denza's only model at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show since BYD's sub-brand also has the purely electric N7. It's a five-seater SUV with a height-adjustable air suspension, panoramic sunroof, and a maximum driving range of 354 miles (570 kilometers). It'll take 20 minutes to juice up the battery from 30 to 80 percent thanks to 230-kW charging capabilities.
Denza is scheduled to reach the European market near the end of the year.

Jeep Is Preparing Five New Or Refreshed Models For 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/709929/what-jeep-is-planning-2025/,"The all-electric Wagoneer S goes on sale in Q3 2024, while the smaller Recon will launch by the end of the year.",2024-12-25 08:55:28,"2025 will be a big year for Jeep. It’ll have two battery-electric vehicles on sale and a larger lineup of plug-in hybrids. Jeep’s new CEO, Antonio Filosa, briefed the media Friday about the comapny’s plans for the upcoming year and its strategy to increase its market share.
The Jeep Wagoneer S will enter production in the second quarter of this year before going on sale in Q3 for a short 2024 model year run. It’ll be the fastest Jeep ever when it goes on sale, hitting 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S have 600 horsepower and ride on Stellantis’ scalable STLA Large platform, just like the new Recon, which should launch before the end of the year. Jeep wouldn’t provide specific dates for Recon’s production and arrival, but it will have its first full sales year in 2025 alongside the Wagoneer S.
Jeep’s lineup of 4xe plug-in hybrids will grow through next year. One model likely to arrive is the previously announced Gladiator PHEV, with Jeep planning to launch five new models or updated variants in 2025. The revamped lineup is part of the brand’s strategy to increase its market share in the US after five consecutive years of falling sales.
Ready For Off-Road Fun:
Jeep is already laying the groundwork for a successful 2025. It's lowered the prices of several models for 2024, including the Grand Cherokee and the recently updated Gladiator, and it’ll integrate the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer into the Jeep brand. The Wrangler also got an update for this model year. Filosa has also implemented a new team to improve quality and lower costs.

The Ineos Fusilier Is The Retro Electric Off-Roader Of Your Fantasies,https://www.motor1.com/news/709875/ineos-fusilier/,Ineos' second vehicle is a smaller EV with a range extender option and squared-off retro looks.,2024-12-25 08:55:29,"Ineos Automotive revealed on Friday its third vehicle, an all-electric SUV called the Fusilier. Like its first SUV, the Grenadier, the Fusilier sports a squared-off, retro-inspired design. In addition to a purely electric variant, Ineos will offer the Fusilier with a gas-powered range-extender option.
The Fusilier will deliver ""world-class off-road capability with zero compromise to on-road performance,"" according to Ineos. Shorter and lower than the Grenadier, the Fusilier will be built on a skateboard platform featuring a steel top hat, a steel underbody, and aluminum doors.
Ineos has yet to release details on the Fusilier's 4x4 powertrain, so we don't know things like battery size or range.
“As we developed this vehicle, we quickly concluded that in order to move towards decarbonization but continue making cars that consumers want to drive, we need a mix of powertrain technologies,"" CEO Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. ""BEVs are perfect for certain uses: shorter trips and urban deliveries, but industry and governments need to have realistic expectations around other technologies that can help accelerate the necessary pace of change.""
Going by photos released by Ineos, the Fusilier looks to have some real off-road chops, with all-terrain tires, a front skid plate, and high bumpers. The hood and door designs remind us of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class. According to Top Gear, the shorter, lower silhouette and things like active grille shutters were used to improve efficiency.
Ineos says it partnered with Magna to develop the Fusilier. The SUV will be built at Magna's facility in Graz, Austria. It joins cars like the G-Class, the BMW Z4, the Toyota Supra, and the Fisker Ocean as other cars contracted to be built by the company.
Expect more news from Ineos on the Fusilier's powertrain and launch details by Fall of this year.

2026 Kia EV8 / Stinger: Everything You Need To Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/709711/kia-ev8-stinger-electric-range-price-details/,"The Kia Stinger is gone, but the EV8 should be its electric successor.",2024-12-25 08:55:31,"Kia is on the fast track to electrification with no less than nine hybrid or full EVs already at dealerships. That number will increase with the upcoming EV8, a mid-size sedan that leaked out early to the public recently through official documents.
The details included everything from power outputs to estimated range, with styling expected to draw heavily from the EV4 Concept—a vehicle said to be inspired at least partly bt the Stinger. So there’s potential this electric sedan could be pretty darned exciting.
Kia hasn’t announced anything official yet, but the leaks and rumors paint a pretty clear picture of what’s to come. Here’s everything we know so far about the Kia EV8.
Kia is sticking with a specific design language for its electric models and we believe the EV8 will follow suit. Our exclusive renderings feature a longish nose despite the lack of a combustion engine, with tall doors and a raked windshield melding into a fastback shape. Some might call it a sedan, others will say it’s a five-door hatchback.
Regardless, this rendering pays homage to the Stinger with its overall shape. That includes a rather aggressive lower fascia in front and a bulky backside bringing up the rear, something we’ve already seen on the EV4 Concept. That also means it rides lower than the EV6, which Kia actually showcased with the Stinger to give the performance car its send-off. While the EV6 is more of a crosover, the EV8 will look more like a traditional sedan.
Lastly, the leaked info says this car has a codename of GT1, which we see as an ode to the 2011 GT concept that was basically a Stinger preview. It all points to the EV8 being a proper Stinger successor.
Here's where the EV8 should eclipse the Stinger… by a lot. Leaked details reveal a dual-motor powertrain generating 603 horsepower in top trim. That’s nearly double the power of the Stinger’s twin-turbo V6, but lower-spec trim levels are expected. A more modest 435-horsepower dual-motor model should be offered, as well as a single-motor variant generating 218 horsepower for just the rear wheels.
Of course, the Stinger’s overall performance wasn’t all about power. It was a balanced sports sedan with delicious handling characteristics, and the EV8 may follow suit. It will ride on Hyundai’s new Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) versus the E-GMP platform currently used by Hyundai and Kia EVs. Hyundai bills this as being far more advanced and flexible for multiple genres. Whether that includes a rip-snorting sports sedan, we’ll soon find out.
Making the most of that new platform will be a big ol’ battery, topping out at 113.2 kilowatt-hours according to the leaked documents. It’s unclear at this time if smaller battery options will be available, but it certainly wouldn’t be a surprise. The EV9 currently packs a 99.8-kilowatt-hour pack, and the EV6 offers either 58.0- or 77.4-kilowatt-hour options. At 113.2, this would be the biggest battery ever offered in a Kia.
With a big battery comes big range (in theory), and we’re hearing that could be nearly 500 miles on the generous WLTP cycle in Europe. An EPA-focused range could be closer to around 370 miles, but that’s still a strong number.
Right now, we’re hearing a production launch happening late in 2025 for the 2026 model year. Based on what we’ve seen from Kia in the past, that means an official debut could happen in the fourth quarter of 2024. There’s also a question of where it will be sold—Kia may offer it for the North American market, but oftentimes models go on sale first in South Korea with other markets following months later. That means it may not make it to US dealerships until later in 2026.
We have no information at this time regarding price, but we can offer some context for a general estimate. The outgoing Stinger had a price ranging from around $36,000 to over $50,000 in range-topping trim. The current EV6 starts at $42,600 but lands at $61,600 for a range-topping GT AWD model. As such, a starting price of around $45,000 is certainly possible, with the 603-hp version brushing against $65,000. Of course, we’ve seen EV prices fluctuate significantly in the last year, so there’s certainly time for markets to shift before EV8 production begins.
It’s unlikely that the EV8 will be eligible for an EV tax credit. Kia presently only has one manufacturing facility in the US and it doesn’t include EVs. However, some Kia leasing programs offer credits that match tax incentives. As with price, much can (and probably will) change between now and when the EV8 goes on sale.

"Jeep Recalls Nearly 200,000 Hybrids For Malfunctioning Defrost System",https://www.motor1.com/news/709402/jeep-wrangler-grand-cherokee-4xe-recall/,Certain Wrangler 4xes and Grand Cherokee 4xes have been recalled for a software issue that could disable the windshield defrost system.,2024-12-25 08:55:32,"Jeep is recalling nearly 200,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A recall issued by the automaker and published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe could have software that disables the windshield defrost system in certain conditions.
A select number of 2021-2024 Wranglers and 2022-2024 Grand Cherokees were built with incorrectly programmed hybrid control processor software. The recall affects 139,318 Wrangler 4xes and 59,825 Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, dating back to the beginning of the variants' production.
Jeep produced the affected vehicles from September 2, 2020, to August 24, 2023, and from July 23, 2021, to December 5, 2023, respectively. Jeep will fix the issue by updating the hybrid control processor. It's already implemented the new software in the models' production, so if you're about to take delivery of a new Jeep, you don't have to worry about this problem.
This is the Wrangler 4xe's second recall in four months. In November, Jeep asked owners not to charge their vehicle's battery due to a potential fire risk affecting 32,000 cars.
Stellantis says it first became aware of the issue in June 2023, investigating the inoperative defrost systems through January. It'll inform affected owners by April 5. If you think your Jeep may be affected, we suggest heading over to the NHTSA's recall website and punching in your VIN.

Chevy Silverado And GMC Sierra Plug-In Hybrids Coming: Report,https://www.motor1.com/news/709472/chevy-silverado-gmc-sierra-phev/,GM has allegedly canceled a Ford Maverick-sized electric pickup truck.,2024-12-25 08:55:33,"""We're not going to dilute our investment with hybrids""—is what General Motors President Mark Reuss told Business Insider in 2022. But apparently the company has had a change of heart. During an investor briefing last month, CEO Mary Barra announced new plug-in hybrid models, with reports indicating the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra PHEVs are on the way.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, Autoweek claims GM is in a hurry to launch PHEV versions of the two trucks. The company has apparently initiated a ""crash program"" to speed up the development and market launch of the two electrified derivatives. We've reached out to both Chevy and GMC for comment, and we'll update the story if we hear back.
The plug-in hybrids would bridge the gap between the regular Silverado and Sierra with combustion engines and the newly launched purely electric models. The PHEV duo would address the range anxiety that typically comes with pure EVs, especially workhorses used to tow and/or carry heavy cargo.
Some will remember what Barra said back at a Barclays investor conference in 2019: ""Customers generally aren't interested in hybrids, the value proposition there. We believe moving to electric vehicles as quickly as possible is the right thing to do."" Earlier the same year, Reuss told The Wall Street Journal it would be wiser to spend the R&D money on EVs rather than PHEVs: ""If I had a dollar more to invest, would I spend it on a hybrid? Or would I spend it on the answer that we all know is going to happen, and get there faster and better than anybody else?""
In 2024, the scenario has changed. Demand for EVs is cooling down, and PHEVs could serve as a stopgap before full electrification. The Wall Street Journal reports ""influential dealers"" are putting pressure on GM to launch hybrid models to avoid losing customers who aren't ready to switch to EVs. In late January, Barra said during a call about GM's financial results for Q4 2023 the ""forward plan includes bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America.
According to the same report from Autoweek, GM has also changed its mind about replacing the ancient Express and Savana with electric vans for the 2026 model year. The plan was to use GM's Ultium platform, with the new models to take after the BrightDrop Zevo 600 commercial fleet delivery van, but those plans have been shelved.
There were also plans for two electric trucks, one about the size of a Ford Maverick and the other roughly as big as a Ranger. However, the former has purportedly been canceled while development of the latter has been halted.
Should a Silverado and Sierra hybrid hit the market, these wouldn't be the first. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, GM paired a 6.0-liter V8 engine with two electric motors for a ""two-mode hybrid system."" It was compatible with both 2WD and 4WD versions and came with a 300-volt nickel-metal hydride battery pack mounted underneath the second-row seats. The combustion engine was good for 332 horsepower and 367 pound-feet of torque while the e-motors were each rated at 80 hp.
The old hybrid models were able to run solely on electric juice at speeds of up to 30 mph (48 km/h) and there was even regenerative braking to charge the battery. Their successors, if GM is indeed planning them, are slated to be PHEVs, meaning there's going to be a charging port to replenish the battery like you would do on a Silverado EV or Sierra EV.

"The New Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid Is Less Powerful, More Expensive",https://www.motor1.com/news/709282/porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid/,"536 hp for $126,800.",2024-12-25 08:55:35,"When Porsche introduced the third-generation Panamera last November, it only showed the base model with rear- and all-wheel drive alongside the hot Turbo E-Hybrid. Zuffenhausen is now diversifying the lineup by launching two additional electrified models. They're not traditional ""Turbo"" models, but they swap the big V8 in favor of a V6 and keep the pair of turbochargers.
The Panamera 4E Hybrid combines a 2.9-liter engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 463 horsepower and 479 pound-feet. Compared to its predecessor, the new model has gained eight mighty horses but has lost 37 lb-ft. Despite its heft, this is a seriously quick sedan (it's technically a hatchback) since it takes just 3.9 seconds to reach 60 mph, or 0.3s less than the model it's replacing. Flat out, it'll do an identical 174 mph.
The Panamera 4S E-Hybrid now has 536 hp and 553 lb-ft, which means Porsche has sacrificed 16 horses while carrying over the same amount of torque. It completes the sprint in 3.5 seconds as before, en route to 180 mph, down by 5 mph.
All electrified Panamera models share an upgraded battery pack with a capacity boosted by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours without increasing the physical size. The battery provides juice to a beefier e-motor mounted within the automatic transmission, rated at 187 hp and 331 lb-ft.
Porsche isn't disclosing range details for the US-spec models for now. However, we know the European ones can travel on electric power for up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) in the case of the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and 92 kilometers (57 miles) for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. These WLTP figures are likely to decrease for the EPA-certified range.
In the US, Porsche wants $115,500 for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and $126,800 for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. The new models command a premium of $6,500 and $7,600, respectively. For your money's worth, an adaptive air suspension and matrix LED headlights are standard. To sweeten the pot, 14-way comfort seats, a heated steering wheel, soft-close doors, and lane change assist are included as well.
The order books will open in late March, and you'll pay an extra $1,995 for delivery and handling fees. The cars will hit dealers this fall.

The Cupra Born VZ Is An Electric Hot Hatch With 322 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/709322/cupra-born-vz-debut-specs/,The Volkswagen Group is trying to spice up its EV offerings.,2024-12-25 08:55:36,"Spun off from the Volkswagen Group's SEAT brand in 2018, Cupra is introducing its first electric performance vehicle. The sporty derivative is based on the Born compact model and gets the ""VZ"" suffix, which is an acronym for ""veloz""—Spanish for ""fast."" The brand's first-ever EV gets a healthy power boost and other upgrades.
The rear-wheel-drive electric hot hatch uses an upgraded motor delivering 322 horsepower and a massive instant torque of 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters). These output figures represent a huge boost of 94 hp and 235 Nm (173 lb-ft) over the previous most potent variant of the Cupra Born. Courtesy of the newly unlocked electric oomph, the VZ variant shaves off a full second from the sprint to 62 mph (100 km/h), which now takes 5.7 seconds. Top speed has gone up by 25 mph (40 km/h) to 124 mph (200 km/h).
There's more to the Born VZ than a beefier e-motor since Cupra is also giving it a pair of exclusive 20-inch wheels, including a forged set with performance tires. The cooler alternative to the troubled SEAT brand has bumped the battery pack's net capacity by 2 kWh to 79 kWh for an estimated range of 335 miles (570 kilometers). The steering is sharper and there are additional tweaks to the suspension for better handling while the brakes feel more direct than before.
In terms of styling, Cupra is offering the new Born VZ in this Dark Forest color or you can play it safe by getting the feisty electric hatch in Midnight Black. The newly added “VZ” logo on the tailgate has a dark chrome look to echo the “Cupra” lettering. Inside, it gets a pair of body-hugging seats not shared with the lesser models. However, these bucket seats are already available in some performance cars with a combustion engine, including the Formentor VZ5 with its inline-five engine borrowed from Audi.
For the range-topping Born, Cupra has upped the infotainment's screen size by 0.9 inches to 12.9 inches. More important is the touch slider to adjust the climate and volume since it's finally illuminated. At an additional cost, buyers can get an optional 10-speaker, 425-watt Sennheiser sound system. As standard, the VZ variant gets paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel to choose from one of three levels of energy recuperation.
The Born VZ will go on sale in Europe in the third quarter of the year. Also in 2024, we should see its equivalent Volkswagen version, the ID.3 GTX, or whatever name the sporty electric hatchback will use. These two will compete in a rarified segment that includes the MG4 XPower. The smaller Alpine A290 will join them soon.

"Sony And Honda Have Three New EVs On The Way, Including An SUV",https://www.motor1.com/news/708807/afeela-sony-honda-suv-and-compact-coming-2025-2027-2028/,"Plus, a sedan and a more affordable compact are also on the way.",2024-12-25 08:55:38,"Sony Honda Mobility is the automotive joint venture between Honda and Sony. It aims to build electric vehicles with advanced self-driving technology. Now, there are new details about when the company's first models will hit the road.
In addition to the previously announced Afeela electric sedan coming in 2025, Sony Honda Mobility will launch an SUV in 2027 and a less expensive compact model in 2028 or later, according to Nikkei Asia. All three vehicles will ride on the same platform.
Sony Honda Mobility's compact model will allegedly share components with Honda's in-house developed EVs to keep prices down. The company just showed off the Saloon concept at CES ahead of launching a production model in 2026.
We don't have many details about Sony Honda Mobility's SUV yet. Sony previously showed the Vision-S 02 concept (below) that previewed how such a vehicle might look. It shared a design language with the sedan but with a taller ride and a hatchback.
The Afeela sedan launching in 2025 uses front and rear electric motors, each making 241 horsepower. It has a 91.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Sales in the United States should start in early 2026.
Sony Honda Mobility is loading the Afeela with technology. The pre-production model has 45 sensors, including lidar and eight cameras. Chips from Qualcomm would allegedly provide the processing capability to support Level 3 self-driving, meaning a person would still need to take over control at times.
The Afeela has an understated, smoothly styled exterior. Inside, there's a screen spanning nearly the entire dashboard. Sony intends to provide access to its massive media empire so folks can watch movies like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse or play Fortnite on this display. The driver grips a yoke steering wheel.
Honda would build some of these EVs in Ohio, according to Quartz. Given the location, the vehicles might use the batteries coming from Honda and LG's joint venture factory in the state.

2026 Nissan Leaf: Everything You Need To Know,https://www.motor1.com/features/708804/new-nissan-leaf-range-price-details/,The new Leaf will look dramatically different than the current hatchback.,2024-12-25 08:55:40,"When it debuted in 2011, the Nissan Leaf was revolutionary. It was one of the first affordable EVs that appealed to consumers on a mass scale. By the end of 2023, the company delivered over 670,000 of them worldwide, including more than 184,000 in the US.
The second-gen model launched in 2018 with more power and better range and utility. However, with EVs evolving at lightning speed, the Leaf wasn’t as competitive as it had been in the past. Sales fell 41 percent in 2023 to just 7,152 total units, with Hyundai, Tesla, and other brands began offering more affordable and more efficient alternatives.
But there’s a new Leaf on the horizon. Nissan’s third-generation compact EV will debut sometime in mid-2025 to take on this more competitive market. There’s still plenty we don’t know about the new Leaf ahead of 2025 – but here’s what we can tell you until then.
The new Leaf will reportedly take styling cues from the 2021 Chill-Out concept (pictured throughout), which was a sleek-looking crossover with a broad, stacked grille and wing-shaped lights on its outer edges. The roofline had a simple arch, and there was subtle sculpting along the flanks. The rear even had a clear panel with taillights embedded in it, but that probably won’t make it to production. Otherwise, most of these design cues should carry over.
Unfortunately, there are no official powertrain details on the third-gen Leaf yet. It allegedly rides on the CMF-EV platform, which also sits underneath the Ariya electric crossover. That model is available with a single motor producing 214 or 238 horsepower, or two motors offering 335 and 389 horsepower. There are 66.0-kilowatt-hour and 91.0-kilowatt-hour batteries available.
The timing, though, suggests the Leaf would not yet adopt Nissan’s solid-state batteries, at least at launch. The first vehicle to use those cutting-edge packs don't arrive until 2028. But we do know that most Nissans will move to the NACS charging standard, and that could include the Leaf.
The Nissan Leaf will almost certainly have more range than the current model, which offers just 215 miles at its most efficient. The new batteries will supposedly be up to 30 percent denser than the current ones, which should mean at least 230 miles of range minimum.
We should see the new Nissan Leaf as early as next year. The available information suggests the EV will debut mid-2025 with production slated to kick off in the UK in 2026. It’s likely to be a 2026 model when it goes on sale in the US.
No pricing details about the third-gen Leaf are out there yet. The current model range includes the base S grade for $29,280 or the SV Plus for $37,330. Inflation means that the new one would probably cost a bit more. However, Nissan needs to keep prices in check to remain competitive against affordable EVs like the Hyundai Kona Electric, which starts at $34,010,
Nissan currently builds the Leaf in Smyrna, Tennessee; Sunderland, England; and Yokosuka, Japan – which means it is eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. However, the company plans to end assembly in the United States in mid-2025, which means the third-gen model would not be eligible for the up-to-$7,500 tax credit in the US.
