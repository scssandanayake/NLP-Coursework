Toyota Launches Japan's First Plug-In Hybrid Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/745134/toyota-japan-first-phev-minivan/,The Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs can cover 45 miles in electric mode.,2024-12-25 09:01:53,"Toyota has been offering a hybrid powertrain for the Alphard shortly after the minivan was launched in the early 2000s. Currently in its fourth generation, the people hauler doubles down on electrification by getting a charging port. It's Japan's first PHEV minivan and is joined by the Vellfire sister model, now in its third generation. Both were fully redesigned last year and now their lineups are growing to include a PHEV as the range-topper.
The plug-in hybrid minivans, offered only with six seats, share a lithium-ion battery mounted under the floor. Toyota doesn't disclose the pack's capacity but estimates it has enough juice for an electric range of 45 miles (73 kilometers). However, we should note that the number is based on the overly optimistic WLTC. The figure would likely drop in the WLTP cycle and likely even more if the EPA were ever to test the cars.
When charging at 50 kW, it takes about 38 minutes to replenish the battery to 80%. Toyota doesn't say whether it's from 0%, the usual 20% many automakers quote, or a different state of charge. The Alphard PHEV and Vellfire PHEV deliver 302 horsepower with the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter gasoline engine and electric motors combined. Since the minivans come with the company's E-Four system, there's one electric motor at the front axle and another at the rear.
The battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 1.37 inches (35 millimeters) compared to the regular hybrid model. Bidirectional charging is supported, turning the Alphard and Vellfire PHEVs into power banks. The gas engine can also generate electricity, which would come in handy in an emergency situation. With the battery charged and a full gas tank, the vehicle provides enough electricity for five and a half days of use, calculated from a daily power consumption of 10 kWh.
These minivans are certainly not cheap. At current exchange rates, Toyota wants the equivalent of $68,000 for an Alphard, more than double the price of a base model with a hybrid setup and front-wheel drive. The Vellfire starts at a little over $69,000. The ones with the charging port can be visually distinguished by their exclusive 19-inch wheels, suede headliner, and woodgrain accents on the steering wheel.
The world could certainly use more plug-in hybrid minivans. The only model that immediately springs to mind is the Chrysler Pacifica. However, there's greater variety in China where the family man can get a Buick GL8 PHEV, Trumpchi E8, Denza D9, or a curiously named Voyah Dream. It'll be interesting to see whether the more luxurious Lexus LM based on the Alphard will also receive a charging port.

Honda Prelude Hybrid Will Come To The U.S. In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/744630/honda-prelude-confirmed-producton-coupe/,Honda says the hybrid coupe will bring the fun back to driving with S+ Shift. And Americans won't be missing out.,2024-12-17 10:00:42,"We don’t always talk about non-plug-in hybrids here at InsideEVs, but when it happens, it's usually for a good reason. The Honda Prelude Concept was one of those “good reasons”. Last year, Honda surprised everyone at the Toyko Auto Salon (and again at the LA Auto Show) with a thinly-veiled hybrid coupe concept wearing a familiar name.
This year, Honda surprises us again, just in time for Christmas. Honda’s sporty coupe will be making a return for sure, by late next year—including to the U.S. market. Hallelujah.
The Prelude will be more than just a Civic-based hybrid coupe, though. Honda says that this model will mark a new start of performance-oriented sport hybrid technology, through a feature called “S+ Shift”. We don’t know much about the explicit details, but Honda says it will “advance Linear Shift Control to deliver maximum levels of driver engagement, in keeping with the heritage of the Prelude line.”
From that description, I can’t help but think it could be a production version of Honda’s virtual shifting program I saw this past fall in Tokyo. Honda had it applied on a prototype Honda E, but it was open about its plans to port this gamified tech to other future models in its stable.
Like other Honda hybrids, the Prelude will use the same two-motor gas-electric hybrid system. In this design, a traditional automatic or manual transmission isn’t really possible. But, because the two-motor system has a lot of versatility in how it uses its large electric motors in lieu of a transmission, it should mean that a true PHEV isn’t necessarily out of the question. In many European markets, the CR-V Hybrid is available as a PHEV. Similarly, the Accord Hybrid is also PHEV in China. Could a Prelude PHEV be a simple jump away? Maybe.
Regardless, the Prelude comes at a historic time for Honda. Honda is celebrating the 25 year anniversary of its first hybrid car, the Insight. It also recognized that the Prelude was integral to Honda’s original 1970’s launch.
“The first three products in the Honda lineup in the 1970s were Civic, Accord and Prelude, and soon all three will be back together again in our passenger car lineup as hybrids,"" said Jessika Laudermilk, assistant vice president of Honda Auto Sales.
Honda is still calling the Prelude a concept, but it did send over a few new images of the coupe pained up in a very appropriately festive red. Expect the production model to look pretty close to what we see here when it goes on sale next year.

Nissan Made An Electric GT-R R32,https://www.motor1.com/news/744125/nissan-reveals-electric-gtr-r32/,Get used to the idea of an electric Godzilla because the R36 will likely be an EV.,2024-12-25 09:01:55,"Nissan has been working on an electric conversion for the GT-R R32 since March 2023. The controversial project is finally ready for prime time. Built by a team of volunteer engineers, the sports car is heading to the 2025 Tokyo Auto Salon, where it won't have an RB26DETT gas engine under the hood. The twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six has been yanked out, making way for an all-electric powertrain.
For now, Nissan is sharing only this image. However, the R32 GT-R EV appeared late last month in Japan during the R's Meeting at the Fuji Speedway. The project aims to ""capture and recreate the charm of the BNR32 by integrating modern electrification."" Visually, it's almost identical to the donor car, but we notice the fog lights have been removed while the brake calipers are now orange.
Since Nissan remains secretive about the technical specifications, we can only speculate for now. Assuming it's still all-wheel drive, the GT-R features two electric motors–one for each axle. An Ariya Nismo is offered with as much as 430 hp and 443 lb-ft, well above the 276 hp and 271 lb-ft delivered by the R32's original combustion engine.
In reality, the six-cylinder mill produced much more power. Nissan intentionally underrated the engine to comply with the ""gentlemen's agreement"" between Japanese automakers. Consequently, it artificially limited output to 276 hp. Strapped onto a dyno, a stock R32 usually made over 300 hp. Fully modified, the RB26DETT can belt out 2,000 hp.
While the R32 GT-R EV will likely remain a one-off, Nissan has already strongly suggested that the next-generation Godzilla will be electric. The bonkers Hyper Force concept had GT-R DNA written all over it, plus solid-state batteries and a colossal 1,341 hp. The Japanese automaker has stopped spending money on new combustion engines, so the R36 will likely be an EV.
Since Nissan's solid-state batteries aren't coming before 2028, the next-generation supercar is unlikely to arrive until around the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the electric R32 will be publicly displayed at TAS between January 10-12. The outgoing R35 will also be there in GT-R Nismo Special Edition flavor for the Japanese market.

Crazy Renault 5 Turbo 3E Is Headed To Production,https://insideevs.com/news/744326/renault-5-turbo-3e-production-specs-ev/,"The French are once again turning the craziness dial to 11. Meet the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a rear-wheel drive super hatch.",2024-12-13 08:19:53,"French automakers have a knack for making weird stuff that sometimes turns out to be extremely interesting. The Citroen SM rings a bell, and so does the original Renault 5. The latter went through several iterations, but probably the most recognizable of them all is the properly bonkers Renault 5 Turbo, a mid-engined rally-bred fire-breathing hatchback that was good for 120 miles per hour.
Well, the R5 Turbo is back, albeit for the electric age. This is the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a battery-powered super hatchback based on the recently revealed series-production city EV. But here’s the kicker, the Turbo 3E is also going into production, which gets our stamp of approval for serious craziness on Renault’s part.
It takes a lot of courage to bring something like this on the market, especially in Europe where things haven’t been going quite as well on the EV front as some manufacturers had hoped. But here comes Renault with a car that looks like it was envisioned by a 10-year-old after watching too much old-school rally footage.
More French Stuff
But enough of that. What’s under the skin of this thing? Quite a lot as it turns out, and its powertrain configuration is rather interesting. The Renault 5 Turbo 3E has two electric motors housed in the rear wheels. Combined, they put out over 500 horsepower, enough for a zero to 62 miles per hour sprint in just 3.5 seconds.
There’s no word on what battery will power this electric pocket rocket, or how much time will be needed to replenish said battery. But does it really matter? Look at it! It’s significantly wider than the standard Renault 5, with tires so skinny you’d be forgiven for thinking they could hold next to no air. There’s also a delightful nod to the original R5 Turbo and Turbo 2 of the 1980s in the form of side-mounted air vent lookalikes. In the originals, they fed fresh air to the combustion engine, and in the modern reinterpretation, one of those vents hides the charging port.
There are no photos of the interior, but we expect a familiar look as the tamer Renault 5, with dual screens and a touch of exuberance. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will have “performance worthy of a supercar or even a hypercar.” There’s no launch date yet, but we expect it to become a reality sometime in 2026. Bring it!",Iulian Dnistran
The Toyota Urban Cruiser Returns To Europe As A Compact EV Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/744182/toyota-urban-cruiser-ev-specs-battery-official/,Remember the Scion xD? This is its successor in Europe.,2024-12-12 07:54:06,"Quick history lesson. Ill-fated car brand Scion sold the xD in North America for about six years before being discontinued in the second half of the 2010s. It was a subcompact crossover that was little more than a rebadged Toyota Ist. The Ist was also sold in Europe as the Urban Cruiser. All were powered by small gas engines and slotted below the Rav4.
Well, the Toyota Urban Cruiser nameplate is back, at least in Europe, after an eight-year hiatus. This time around, it’s once again a badge-engineering job, but in the form of an all-electric compact crossover that gets its design inspiration from last year’s Urban SUV concept.
More Toyota EVs
Measuring 168.7 inches long, 70.8 inches wide and 64.5 inches tall, and with a wheelbase of 106.3 inches, the all-new Toyota Urban Cruiser is larger than both the Yaris Cross and C-HR hybrids, but smaller than the bZ4X electric crossover. It’s also the same car underneath as the recently revealed Suzuki e Vitara–same platform, same battery, same electric motors and even the same interior. They’re also built in the same factory in India.
Let’s talk about the powertrain, then. Like its Suzuki counterpart, the Toyota Urban Cruiser is available with either a 49- or 61-kilowatt-hour battery. Both versions are of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) variety. The small pack is only offered in conjunction with a front-mounted electric motor making 142 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque. The large pack can be had with either the 142 hp front motor or a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for a total system output of 181 hp and 221 lb-ft.
Toyota didn’t say anything about the driving range. It did, however, mention that all versions of the Urban Cruiser come as standard with a heat pump and a manually operated pre-heating option for the battery, which should improve efficiency and lower charging times in cold climates. That said, we don’t know how much it would take to recharge the Urban Cruiser’s battery.
The front-wheel drive version gets a Snow Mode to help reduce wheel slip when driving on snow-covered roads, while the all-wheel drive version comes with Downhill Assist control and a Trail Mode which should detect when a wheel is spinning and send torque to the opposite wheel that has more traction.
Standard equipment also includes a pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert and lane keep assist. On the dashboard, there’s a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen.
We’ll know more about the new Urban Cruiser after Toyota officially unveils it at the 2025 Brussels Motor Show in January.",Iulian Dnistran
Ford Puma Gen-E: Mustang Mach-E’s Little Brother With Up To 233 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/742709/ford-puma-gen-e-electric-specs-range-battery/,The electric crossover is smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV.,2024-12-03 04:30:00,"The well-known Ford Mustang Mach-E electric crossover now has a little brother–in Europe, at least. Meet the new Ford Puma Gen-E, a battery-powered subcompact crossover that’s smaller than the discontinued first-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV but somehow has a bigger trunk than some large SUVs.
Measuring 165.9 inches long and 71 inches wide and with a wheelbase of 101.8 inches, the new Puma Gen-E is roughly 4 inches shorter than the Bolt EUV and the smallest electric vehicle in Ford’s European portfolio. The combustion-powered Puma is the automaker’s best-seller in Europe, and with the introduction of the electric version, Ford is hoping it can turn the tide that forced it to idle its flagship EV factory in Cologne due to poor demand for the Explorer EV and Capri.
Set to be built at its factory in Romania, the Ford Puma Gen-E is available with a single battery version–a 43-kilowatt-hour (usable) lithium ion pack with nickel manganese cobalt chemistry. On the four-door crossover, it can deliver a combined WLTP-rated range of up to 233 miles. The maximum DC fast charging speed is 100 kW, and it takes a little over 23 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% state of charge. Ford did not say how much power the on-board AC charger can accept or how long a top-up on a Level 2 charger would take.
Two trim levels will be on offer, but a single powertrain is available–a front-mounted single electric motor making 165 horsepower and 214 pound-feet of torque. It takes eight seconds for the Puma Gen-E to accelerate from a standstill to 62 miles per hour. That’s nearly as fast as the sporty, gas-powered Puma ST which needs 7.4 seconds to reach 62 mph.
Design-wise, the electric Puma is very similar to its dinosaur juice-powered siblings. The biggest difference is the Mustang Mach-E-like front “shield” design. Different alloy wheels and a sporty rear spoiler complete the picture.
Inside, there’s a pair of screens–a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen running Ford’s latest Sync 4 system and a 12.8-inch digital instrument cluster. Both come as standard, as does the wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.
More Stuff Like This
One thing that set the gas-powered Puma apart from its rivals was the clever use of space, particularly in the trunk, where the so-called MegaBox adds 2.8 cubic feet of cargo space under the floor. Well, in the Puma Gen-E, that under-floor storage is even bigger, as the name GigaBox would suggest. In total, the electric Puma has a cargo volume of 20.2 cubic feet, with the GigaBox accounting for 5.1 cubic feet. There’s also a 1.5 cubic feet front trunk that seems more like an afterthought than anything else.
The base model comes with 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, cruise control, a six-speaker audio system, heated door mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, ambient lighting, Amazon Alexa and four-way adjustable front seats. The Premium trim adds a B&O Play sound system with ten speakers, keyless entry, a hands-free tailgate, 18-inch wheels and Dynamic Matrix LED headlights with Glare-Free High Beam. Intelligent adaptive cruise control with stop & go and lane centering, as well as cross-traffic alert and a 360-degree camera system are optional.
The Ford Puma Gen-E will go on sale in Europe in the first part of next year. Pricing has not been announced yet.",Iulian Dnistran
The 2025 Kia EV6 GT Gets Ioniq 5 N-Style 'Virtual Gear Shift',https://insideevs.com/news/741857/kia-ev6-gt-virtual-shifter/,"Simulated gear shifts will pair well with 641 horsepower, don't you think?",2024-11-21 12:50:00,"Just admit it: you love the idea of simulated gear shifting in electric vehicles. Oh, you may act like you hate the anachronistic idea of changing ""gears"" in a car that technically only has a one-speed transmission because it ruins the ""purity"" of the smooth and efficient EV experience. Or maybe you're a gas car purist and the idea of trying to simulate a transmission is, at best, like watching a clip of your favorite band on someone's Instagram reel when you could have had a front-row seat to the show instead.
But deep down, you know you're wrong. And you wish every EV could do that. How do I know this? Because every single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all.
Even Jeremy Clarkson calls the Ioniq 5 N ""as much fun as is humanly possible."" Jeremy Clarkson! A man who made an entire career out of being very mad that it's not 1968 anymore. Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red
And joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut today at the LA Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature.
""The GT’s new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,"" Kia officials said in a news release. And that's all they have to say for now, but we'll try and get more at the show itself if we can.
Since Kia and Hyundai are owned by the same parent company but are technically separate entities, the news release does not mention the Ioniq 5 N. Yet it's clear that something similar will now be added to the Ioniq 5's platform-mate, the EV6. And on the Hyundai, the ""N e-Shift"" feature really goes the distance.
2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N First Drive Review
That car simulates an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission using the paddles normally used to adjust regenerative braking intensity on other Hyundai Motor Group cars. When activated—and it has a normal ""drive"" setting as any DCT would—it works much the same way: left paddle to go down a ""gear,"" right to go up. Of course, the EVs do not have multiple forward gears. They have so much instant torque that gears are not necessary to achieve different speeds as they would be on a gas engine, which puts power to the wheels far less efficiently.
But the Ioniq 5 N is also special for how it simulates the ""feel"" of gear shifting, including the jolt and brief interruption in power that happens and the mechanical resistance that's normal upon downshifting. The Ioniq 5 N also simulates engine sounds through the speakers, will let you rev the ""engine"" while parked and has a ""redline"" you'll hit before you need to shift again. It's all great fun.
2025 Kia EV6 GT-Line European Spec Photos, Runaway Red
Based on Kia's statement, we can expect some version of that for the EV6, but I'm eager to see Kia's spin on things. I'm sure engineers will find some way to make it fairly unique to this car.
Beyond that, we know a few other specs, including power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. With GT Mode activated, you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque. Unlike the rest of the EV6 line, the GT will still be made in South Korea, not Kia's Georgia factory, so it won't qualify for U.S. EV tax credits at purchase. Pricing has not been released yet, nor have official photos: what you see above is the European-spec Kia EV6 GT-Line, which is visually similar.
So now we're all wondering the same thing, right? The new Kia EV6 GT, or the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N? We have reason to believe the Kia is a hotted-up version of the existing model with a ton of extra power and some new tricks, while the Hyundai is a top-to-bottom performance car rework that's meant for track day duty. But the EV6 GT may still be no slouch. This a showdown we'll have to take to the track in 2025 so we can find out.

"2026 Kia EV9 GT: Sporty Electric SUV With Native Tesla NACS Port, Virtual Gear Shifts",https://insideevs.com/news/741837/2026-kia-ev9-gt-specs-nacs-port/,Meet Kia’s most powerful three-row SUV. It just happens to be electric.,2024-11-21 12:45:00,"This is the all-new 2026 Kia EV9 GT. Not to be confused with the EV9 GT-Line which was already available with some sporty-looking hardware, the newly introduced version is Kia’s most powerful production three-row SUV.
Boasting a dual-motor powertrain with a total estimated output of 510 horsepower, the Kia EV9 GT is 122 hp more powerful than the EV9 GT-Line. That’s enough to propel the sporty electric family hauler from zero to 60 miles per hour in an estimated 4.3 seconds, seven-tenths of a second quicker than the GT-Line.
The front motor of the EV9 GT makes 214 hp while the rear drive unit pumps out 362 hp, but because they don’t reach peak power at the same time, you can’t just add the numbers together. The torque figure was not disclosed by the Korean automaker.
More Kia Stories
Kia’s go-fast family hauler adopts a rather controversial feature from the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N–Virtual Gear Shifts. We quite liked the simulated gear shifts when we drove the refreshed Ioniq 5 N, but there are plenty of people out there who think an EV–which doesn’t actually have gears–shouldn’t try to impersonate a gas-powered car. This includes some folks at Porsche who said such a feature will only make their cars worse.
The system works in conjunction with the in-cabin electric Active Sound Design (e-ASD) system to make it feel like the car shifts through gears while accelerating. The EV jolts when it goes from one virtual gear to another and the sound system provides the audio cues to tie it all together.
The EV9 GT is Kia’s first three-row SUV to get electronically controlled suspension or ECS. This can soften or harden the suspension damping based on what driving mode has been selected: Normal, Eco, Sport or My Drive. These modes also alter the steering and brake feel. Speaking of brakes, the flagship EV9 gets larger front rotors than the lesser versions.
At the rear, there’s an electronic limited-slip differential (e-LSD), just like on the EV6 GT, which limits wheelspin to the tires with less grip. Meanwhile, the 7.8-inch ground clearance is the same as on the other trim levels, as is the 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity of the GT-Line.
Just like the new Hyundai Ioniq 5, Genesis Electrified GV70 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, the 2026 Kia EV9 GT comes with Tesla’s NACS charging port from the factory. This means owners will be able to charge at Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network without an adapter. However, an adapter will be needed to charge at DC fast chargers with CCS plugs, like the vast majority of stalls operated by companies like EVgo, Electrify America and ChargePoint.
Kia said that all EV9 versions will come as standard with the NACS charging port starting in the first half of next year. The battery of the EV9 GT is the same as on the other long-range versions–99.8 kilowatt-hours–but the automaker hasn’t provided a range rating or a maximum charging speed. For reference, the EV9 GT-Line has an EPA-rated range of 270 miles and can accept up to 235 kW from a DC fast charger, enough for a 10% to 80% top-up in less than 25 minutes.
“The EV9 has been a home run for Kia and introduced the first mass-market electric three-row SUV,” said Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America. “And EV9 GT includes all those wonderful elements while amping up the fun factor significantly. This new halo trim is set to spark the hearts of driving enthusiasts who still need the practicality of a six-passenger SUV. You can have your cake and eat it too!”
Outside, the 2026 Kia comes with 21-inch wheels wrapped in 285/45R21 high-performance Continental tires. The brake calipers are painted in neon green and GT-exclusive patterns on the Active Air Flaps in front.
Inside, the cabin is adorned with bright green accents, including on the steering wheel and seats, both of which are unique to the EV9 GT. The standard kit includes Parking Collision Assist with front, side and rear monitoring, as well as Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Navigation-based Smart Cruise Control and others.
Pricing for the 2026 Kia EV9 GT has not been announced yet. However, we know it will go on sale in the latter half of next year. We also know that it will be assembled in South Korea, so any potential federal tax credit when purchasing goes out the window (leasing might make it eligible for a tax credit, if there will still be a tax credit for EVs in 2025.)",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Kia EV6: Made In America With A Tesla NACS Plug, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741756/2025-kia-ev6-specs-us/,Kia's groundbreaking EV6 makes a big comeback for 2025. The new face isn't even the big story here.,2024-11-21 12:45:00,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 gets a lot of well-deserved glory in the electric vehicle space. But personally, I'm more a fan of its cousin, the Kia EV6. So much so that I bought one earlier this year and am strongly considering acquiring it outright whenever my lease is up. But when I look at the changes coming with the updated 2025 Kia EV6, I may just have to consider an upgrade.
What's better now about Kia's electric crossover? Basically, everything. The EV6 will now be built in the U.S. to qualify for at least some EV tax credits; packs more range thanks to a bigger battery; offers a redesigned face and interior; and will come out of the gate with a newly-relocated Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to that vast network of DC fast-chargers.
There's a lot to cover here, so let's dig in.
The EV6 originally debuted way back in 2021 and now sees its most substantive update yet. We've already seen its newly redesigned face—a ""Star Map"" grille designed to more closely match other modern Kia offerings—as the second-generation model has been on sale for a few months in places like Europe and its native South Korea. But the U.S.-spec version comes with more surprises than we anticipated.
The EV6 now gets two battery options in larger sizes than the previous car, offering more range. The base, smaller battery is now 63 kilowatt-hours in size, up from 58 kWh previously, while the larger battery goes from 77.4 kWh to 84 kWh. While exact range figures for each trim level have not been released, Kia claims the Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line models will target 319 miles of range in rear-wheel-drive configuration.
2025 Kia EV6
There's no word yet on range for the dual-motor all-wheel-drive models, unfortunately. But we're expecting all range figures to be generally similar to the 2025 Ioniq 5 that uses the same battery setups, so likely around 290 or more miles of range for the AWD versions. Either way, those should be decent upgrades from the current EV6; the RWD models are currently listed at 310 miles of EPA-rated range and 282 for AWD models (which drops to 252 and 218 miles for the GT-Line and GT variants, respectively.) Considering that my own EV6 Wind AWD regularly tops 300 miles of range on a 100% charge when the weather is fair, those could be much more consistently above that.
Power is roughly similar across the board, however. The Light RWD model is rated at 167 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque, while more powerful RWD models in Light, Long-Range, Wind and GT-Line forms come in at 225 hp and 258 lb.-ft. of torque. Upgrading to AWD gets you 320 hp and 446 lb.-ft. of torque as before.
But I'm happy to say the go-fast Kia EV6 GT gets even more powerful now, which it absolutely didn't need, but nobody's going to say no to more power. The GT delivers 601 hp and 545 lb.-ft. of torque, up from 576 hp before. Turn on GT Mode and you get a full 641 hp and 568 lb.-ft. of torque to adequately meet any Lamborghini-hunting needs that may arise in your community.
2025 Kia EV6
I'll readily admit I'm not the biggest fan of the updated grille. But the EV6 still looks as sharp as ever, and it offers more than just a new face here. The taillights also add Star Map details, while the front and rear bumper have new designs with sharper angles and a more aggressive overall stance. Kia's also offering new designs for its 19- to 21-inch wheels.
2025 Kia EV6
The inside is pretty familiar but with a few notable tweaks. The steering wheel has been totally redesigned, and the EV6 finally gets the fully updated Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) operating system that offers quicker speeds, higher-definiton graphics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates—something the current EV6 has only done with navigation and a handful of other core features. Basically, the software setup on the EV6 now mirrors that of the EV9, which gets high marks from us. And like the EV9, you now get access to the new Kia Connect Store for downloads like displays themed after your favorite NBA teams. (Yes, really.) The Digital Key setup has been improved to offer true smartphone-activated door unlocking, remote starting and driving.
And finally, the flush door handles now pop open automatically across all trim levels. That fixes one of my biggest gripes about the current EV6 and may justify an upgrade on that alone.
Kia's unfortunately not telling us much about the EV6's legendary fast-charging. The car can go from a 10% charge to 80% in just about 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast-charger, and we don't expect that to change. However, like the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and updated Genesis Electrified GV70 that also debuted at the LA Auto Show this week, the revised EV6 packs a NACS plug from the factory now. And it's been moved to the other side of the car—the driver's side instead of the passenger's—to make charging at Tesla's Supercharger stations a little easier.
2025 Kia EV6
And best of all, the revised EV6 is now American-made, just like the 2025 Ioniq 5. This one is made at Kia's West Point, Georgia assembly plant alongside the EV9, so it should qualify for at least some of the $7,500 EV tax credits when purchased. Those may soon vanish, so take advantage of them while you can. (The EV6 GT will continue to be built in Korea.)
Kia says that like the outgoing car, the 2025 EV6 will be available in Light (RWD only), Light Long Range (RWD or AWD), Wind (RWD or AWD), GT-Line (RWD or AWD), and GT (AWD) trims. The automaker says it's expected to go on sale in the first half of next year. Pricing and other specs will be announced at a later date.
All in all, the 2025 model year represents a big upgrade for one of the best-equipped, best-looking and best-performing EVs in its class. Expect more on this as we get it.

"2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 Gets Tesla NACS Port Up Front, Bigger Battery",https://insideevs.com/news/741700/2026-genesis-electrified-gv70/,"The charging port is located at the front of the SUV, just like before, but now it’s motorized and heated.",2024-11-20 15:00:00,"The Genesis Electrified GV70 doesn't get as much attention as some of the Hyundai Motor Group's other electric models, but it's always impressed us with its combination of style, performance and comfort. Now, a lot more people might notice it soon, as it's found at Tesla Supercharger stations.
This is the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70. It’s not a completely new model but rather a subtle facelift that also brings a couple of notable changes under the skin. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a native NACS charging port at the front of the EV. The location of the port isn’t new–the outgoing model’s CCS1 port was also at the front–but the native NACS is new and makes the Electrified GV70 the first EV in the Genesis lineup to come with one from the factory.
2026 Genesis GV70 Electrified Tesla NACS
As a reminder, NACS means North American Charging Standard. It’s Tesla’s invention and it means the 2026 Electrified GV70 will be able to recharge at Tesla Superchargers in North America without using a charging adapter. However, Genesis said customers will get an NACS to CCS adapter to top up their EVs at CCS DC fast chargers. Combined, there are over 36,000 NACS and CCS DC fast chargers in the United States, so going on long road trips shouldn’t be a daunting experience anymore.
More Genesis Stuff (Not The Band)
Besides switching from CCS to NACS, Genesis added a motor to the charging port door (it previously used a manual release), as well as a heating element to the charging port to help with de-icing during cold months. There’s also new lighting to make it easier to see what you’re doing while parked in dark places.
The second notable change is a bigger battery under the floor. The outgoing model had a 77.4-kilowatt-hour pack that enabled an EPA-estimated range of 236 miles on a full charge. The 2026 model comes with a larger 84 kWh battery that should provide a longer driving range, but there’s no official rating yet. Power remains unchanged, with a dual-motor setup good for 429 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.
Several design changes have been made, including a redesigned G-Matrix Crest Grille and multi-lens array (MLA) headlamps. There’s also a refreshed skid plate design and new 19- and 21-inch wheels. Inside, there’s an all-new 27-inch OLED display that integrates both the instrument cluster and infotainment.
The facelifted Electrified GV70 now responds quicker and better to voice commands, according to the Korean automaker. There are also improved over-the-air update capabilities, but we don’t know what that means, exactly.
The 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 is manufactured in South Korea but Hyundai Motor Group’s plant in Alabama is responsible for the final assembly. Genesis says the EV is “dual-sourced at the brand’s production facilities in Montgomery, Alabama and Ulsan, Korea.”
The refreshed all-electric SUV will arrive at North American retailers in the first half of 2025. Pricing details are yet to be determined, but we’ll know more when Genesis starts taking orders next year. The current model starts at $68,300 including destination. We expect the refreshed model to be similar in price.",Iulian Dnistran
"VinFast VF9 Price Dropped By $12,000 As U.S. Deliveries Begin",https://insideevs.com/news/741613/vinfast-vf9-us-deliveries/,The three-row electric SUV is competing with the likes of the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq. It's also cheaper than before.,2024-11-20 03:28:29,"Vietnamese automaker VinFast has officially started deliveries of its more upmarket electric SUV, the VF9. The battery-powered three-row SUV slots above the VF8 and competes with other family-oriented EVs such as the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq.
Two versions of the VinFast VF9 will be available in the United States, the VF9 Eco and VF9 Plus. The entry-level Eco starts at $69,800 (excluding destination) while the slightly more upmarket Plus starts from $73,800. That said, the first units to be delivered to U.S. customers will be VF9 Plus models.
The prices are much lower than originally announced. Last year, the entry-level version had an MSRP of $83,000, while the Plus was priced at $91,000. These estimates were lowered in December to $79,800 for the Eco and $85,800 for the Plus trim.
More VinFast Stuff
To sweeten the deal, VinFast is offering a promotional lease price of $529 per month for the first 100 VF9s delivered stateside. According to the automaker, this figure includes a $3,500 discount and a $2,000 down payment. Meanwhile, the VF9 Eco will become available later this year.
Both trim levels come with the same battery–a 123-kilowatt-hour (usable) pack delivering up to 330 miles of range on the Eco and 291 miles on the Plus. The main reason for the range difference is the wheel size. The Eco is equipped with 20-inch wheels, while the Plus comes with standard 21-inchers. The more upmarket version also gets front fog lights, a 12-way power driver seat with memory, heating, ventilation and massage, as well as eight-way power adjustment for second-row seats. The Plus can be optionally specced with six seats instead of seven.
The VF9 Eco and VF9 Plus come with a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup delivering 402 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque. The EV supports Plug & Charge and Auto Charge at compatible chargers. Plugging it into a DC fast charger will replenish the battery from 10% to 70% state of charge in 35 minutes, according to VinFast.
The VF9 enters the increasingly competitive large electric three-row SUV segment. Measuring 201.5 inches long, 78.9 inches wide and 66.7 inches tall, it’s right up there with cars like the Kia EV9 and Cadillac Vistiq. Compared to the EV9, the VF9’s wheelbase is two inches longer while the body is 4.3 inches longer. Compared to the Cadillac Vistiq, the VinFast VF9 is 4 inches shorter but the wheelbase is 2 inches longer.
VinFast didn’t say anything about the VF9’s eligibility for the federal tax credit. The electric three-row SUV is made in Vietnam, but we expect it to be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit when leasing thanks to a loophole in the legislation. It's also worth mentioning that the company's first model sold in the U.S., the VF8, received underwhelming reviews from the press. Journalists complained about the poor ride quality and lackluster software that seemed unfinished at launch. Some of these issues were reportedly fixed along the way.
Pricing-wise, the Kia EV9 is the most affordable of the three, with a starting price of $56,395 (including destination) for the entry-level version with rear-wheel drive and 230 miles of range. Meanwhile, the Cadillac Vistiq is priced from $78,790 (including destination) and comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive and a GM-estimated range of 300 miles.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis' New 'Engineering Marvel' Trucks Aim For 690 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/741584/stellantis-truck-platform-stla-frame-erev-bev/,"The new STLA Frame truck platform supports gas, hydrogen, hybrid, electric and EREV power.",2024-11-19 17:30:11,"Stellantis is under increasing pressure to deliver. The European conglomerate, with as many as 14 brands under its umbrella, including Jeep, Dodge and Ram, has struggled to keep pace with the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. Just over the past year, it has laid off hundreds of employees, its workers have gone on strikes and its dealers have been furious about its business strategies. Now it hopes to turn things around with a new platform called STLA Frame.
The platform is engineered for full-size ladder-frame pickup trucks and SUVs. It can be equipped with powertrains for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range hybrids (EREVs) and in the future, even internal combustion, parallel hybrid and hydrogen propulsion systems. Stellantis claimed the EREV can deliver up to 690 miles of range, whereas the BEV can deliver up to 500 miles. It's unclear if those are estimates for European WLTC or American EPA test cycles.
EREVs have been gaining traction lately. Multiple automakers, including Hyundai and Scout Motors, plan to launch EREVs in the next few years. EREVs have both an electric powertrain with a large battery and motors plus a traditional internal combustion engine. The role of the gas engine, however, is only to recharge the battery as the wheels run on electric power only. Here's a detailed explanation of how EREV systems work.
STLA Frame is also engineered to do some heavy-duty tasks. Stellantis claims it will have a maximum towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and a payload rating of 2,700 hundred pounds. The platform appears highly scalable and can accommodate battery sizes between 159 kilowatt-hours and 200+ kWh. Here's the range of dimensions it supports:
STLA Frame BEVs will get an 800-volt architecture. So with 350-kilowatt DC fast chargers, owners can add 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes. EREV will get a 400-volt architecture with a maximum DC fast charging rate of 175 kilowatts—enough to add about 50 miles of range in 10 minutes. Both will be capable of bi-directional charging, so sending power back to the grid, powering a home or an external appliance, or charging another EV will be possible.
The 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which is expected to go on sale in the U.S. in early 2025, uses this platform.
It's unclear which Jeep EVs will ride on STLA Frame. However, the American off-road brand has several models in the pipeline, including the next-generation Wagoneer, which might use one of these configurations. Jeep is also expected to begin deliveries of the Wagoneer S this fall. That SUV rides on the STLA Large platform. We also expect a Wrangler-inspired Recon EV and an affordable electric Renegade within the next few years.
Looking at how hybrid sales have rocketed in the recent past, along with concerns of BEV performance in heavy-duty use cases like towing and hauling, Stellantis may be right in adopting this flexible approach.  Plus, the incoming Trump administration will almost certainly repeal the consumer incentives for BEVs—so having multiple powertrains at hand may be the smart thing to do for now.
""We’re proud of this engineering marvel and look forward to seeing it come to life in our upcoming product blitz on Jeep and Ram,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said.

Here's The $634 Million Electric Jaguar That Died At The Last Minute,https://insideevs.com/news/741582/jaguar-xj-ev-canceled-leak/,"""We would have done the facelift by now,"" design legend Ian Callum lamented on social media.",2024-11-19 17:00:59,"Jaguar is back.
No one can say that today's relaunch of the storied British brand—complete with a bold new logo, a high-fashion vibe, and a super-luxury mission but no actual cars—was a universal success. But it's the first sign of life from Jaguar in a very long time, and it's further confirmation that Jaguar sees its future as all-electric.
Yet this isn't the first time we've heard bold promises from Jaguar, which has been struggling since its failed bid to go toe-to-toe with BMW in the 2010s and hasn't launched an actual new model in almost 10 years. The 89-year-old brand was supposed to launch a similar electric onslaught at the start of our current decade, but its then-new CEO Thierry Bolloré pulled the plug at the last minute.
That car, an electric rebirth of the iconic XJ sedan, has been shrouded in mystery for years—until now. Ahead of Jaguar's big announcement today, photos appeared online of an electric XJ prototype that resembles a cross between a 2010s Jaguar sedan and a Tesla Model S. Normally, that sort of thing might get written off as rumor or innuendo, but one post caught the attention of someone who would know what he's talking about: legendary Jaguar designer Ian Callum.
That's as good a confirmation as any, I'd say.
So with Jaguar finally doing something novel, it's worth asking: what the heck happened to this car? Well, after the success of the Jaguar I-Pace—which people often forget was a groundbreaking EV in its day and an early Tesla Model 3 competitor—the company invested billions of dollars into more electric models, starting with an XJ EV. Then Bolloré, a Frenchman and veteran of Michelin and Renault, was named CEO in 2020 and one of his first edicts was to scrap the entire project even though it was extremely close to completion and release. That was a reported write-down of at least £500 million, or $634 million at current exchange rates. His plan was to take Jaguar more upmarket than it's ever been in modern times, winning on profit margins instead of volume sales.
And he evidently didn't think highly of what the electric XJ meant for that mission or for future technologies. ""It was one of the toughest decisions I have ever made, especially since it was in my first month, but XJ was a completely different kind of car from the ones we were proposing – different in technology, battery chemistry, electronics, size, performance and market position,"" Bolloré told Autocar back in 2021. It would never have suited our plans.”
The XJ electric prototype rendered in complete form using AI.
But Bolloré himself would only last another year in the CEO slot until he was replaced with 30-year Jaguar veteran Adrian Mardell. And ""plans"" are certainly something that have felt in short supply at Jaguar in the interim. As we've reported previously, it has launched no new models in years, killed off the I-Pace after age allowed it to become uncompetitive, opted to hit pause on the whole ""selling cars"" thing while executives have bemoaned how ""frustrating"" the move to an electric lineup has been.
Jaguar does seem to be on track to show the world its electric grand touring sedan now, but this move from premium brand to a super-luxury brand means this EV could cost at least $150,000. Will it be worth it, especially as the EV-and-software era means that premium cars aren't what they used to be?
The disguised prototype of the new electric Jaguar (2024)
One thing does feel certain now: this is probably it for Jaguar if it can't pull this off. The brand has been a non-entity in the U.S. so long that it's almost a distant memory for everyone but aging classic car enthusiasts, and there's no guarantee it has what it takes to keep up with quickly evolving players in the EV space—including ones like Lucid Motors or whatever high-tech Chinese brands it has to deal with abroad.
Either way, now we know what the electric Jaguar XJ could've been. And in retrospect, canceling it feels like a mistake; it could've been something, anything at all, for a brand that now has to start from zero again.

Jaguar Has A New Logo,https://insideevs.com/news/741505/jaguar-new-logo/,"It’s a little more complicated than that, though. Here’s why.",2024-11-19 08:25:23,"Jaguar, the British luxury automaker that used to manufacture the I-Pace electric crossover, is starting fresh from a clean slate. It already announced that it’s taking a sort of sabbatical year off from selling any cars before introducing three brand-new all-electric models.
But that’s not all. Now, Jaguar has revealed its new brand identity, including a new logo and everything else surrounding it. But let me say right from the start that it’s not as simple as it might sound. That’s because the British marque isn’t going down the usual route with a simple graphic logo and instead uses several graphical elements as part of its “Copy Nothing” ethos that traces its roots back to the brand’s founder, Sir William Lyons.
In total, four new design elements have been produced, all of which are based on a creative philosophy known as Exuberant Modernism. The problem is that Jaguar isn’t calling any of these elements a logo, so we’ll have to see what its upcoming EVs will end up with on the hood.
More Jaguar Stuff
First, there’s a “Device Mark,” which is a fancy way of saying “We made a new font” named Exuberant. It’s basically just the word “Jaguar.” Next is a 16-bar grid made of horizontal stripes called a “Strike Through.” This will be used as both a background and a “universally recognized symbol” of the new EVs, as per Autocar. See, I told you it’s complicated. But that’s not all.
The third new design element of Jaguar’s reinvention is the “Maker’s Mark,” which is made up of two elements–a redesigned Jaguar “Leaper” and a medallion-shaped “Monogram” that combines the letters “j” and “r” in a circle. The latter “is a code for expression and a signifier of a completed work,” according to the British automaker. It will be used “as a flourish or finished touch.” Jaguar’s new brand identity also includes the “exuberant” use of color as a cornerstone of its new look.
Jaguar Device Mark
Jaguar Maker's Mark
Jaguar Monogram
It all sounds very fancy, but I guess that’s to be expected from a car manufacturer that wants to sell its upcoming super-GT EV for six figures. That’s just the start of the automaker’s new path as an EV-only builder, with two more models to follow, all of which will debut throughout 2026 as British rivals to models like the Mercedes-Benz EQS, Porsche Taycan and more.
Until that happens though, Jaguar will showcase its design direction on December 2. It will signal a “complete reset,” according to CEO Adrian Mardell, who said, “This time, we’re going to do something spectacular.”",Iulian Dnistran
"A Mercedes-Benz CLA EV Prototype Drove 2,309 Miles In 24 Hours–A New Record",https://insideevs.com/news/741445/mercedes-cla-ev-endurance-record-2309-miles-24-hours/,"Thanks to its maximum charging rate of 320 kW, the prototype stopped for short, 10-minute charging breaks.",2024-11-19 03:26:29,"The upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA all-electric sedan is shaping up to be one of the most important battery-powered cars in recent history. The German automaker went above and beyond with its approach to efficiency and it shows.
With a claimed energy efficiency of up to 5.2 miles/kilowatt-hour, the brand-new CLA EV has the potential to topple the Lucid Air–which has a claimed efficiency of 5 miles/kWh–as the world’s most efficient EV. It also packs all the latest tech, including 800-volt charging and a two-speed transmission, making it even more of a conversation starter.
But a bunch of numbers on a sheet of paper don’t mean much if the claims don’t hold water in the real world. That’s why Mercedes-Benz put two CLA EV prototypes to the test on the famed Nardo high-speed track in southern Italy.
More CLA Stuff
The result? A new endurance world record.
One of the prototypes covered 2,309 miles in 24 hours, topping the previous record set in 2019 when a Porsche Taycan drove 2,128 miles in 24 hours. This includes charging stops, of course. Thanks to its 800-volt traction battery and 320-kilowatt maximum charging rate, the CLA EV prototype needed to stop 40 times to recharge its battery.
Each stop took around 10 minutes, which is enough to get the car’s state of charge from 10% to 50%. That’s the equivalent of 186 miles or about 36 kilowatt-hours (the battery pack can hold 85 kWh). Adding everything together, the car was stopped for a total of six hours and 40 minutes to recharge. The average speed was 96.2 miles per hour–including charging stops–and the car’s 130 mph top speed was reached during the session.
The distance covered by the record-breaking prototype is nearly the same as the distance between Los Angeles and Cleveland.
The record-setting CLA prototype, which Mercedes-Benz claims is a close-to-production unit, started the 24-hour run with a full battery. During the endurance test, the engineering team closely monitored the ambient temperature and wind conditions to alter the charging strategy in real-time. The air temperature ranged from 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit at night to 84.2 degrees during the day.
Six drivers were part of the effort–three for each of the prototypes–with three shift changes. That’s eight hours of driving for each of the drivers. The record-setting CLA EV was a rear-wheel drive version with a single, 268-horsepower motor that works in conjunction with a two-speed transmission. The road-going Mercedes-Benz CLA EV is due in late 2025 as a 2026 model.",Iulian Dnistran
The Nissan N7 Is A Big Electric Sedan You Can’t Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/741084/2025-nissan-n7-electric-sedan/,Unless you're willing to move to China.,2024-12-25 09:02:10,"In a sea of electric crossovers and SUVs, a good ol' sedan is a nice change of pace. However, there’s still a problem. Nissan’s new EV will be made in China exclusively for the local market. The N7 was developed with local partner Dongfeng through their 50:50 joint venture. If it weren’t for the badge, I’d honestly be hard-pressed to identify this car as a Nissan.
If the N7 already looks familiar, Dongfeng Nissan previewed the production model in April with the Epoch concept. It’s a sleek sedan that ticks all the design trend boxes in 2024: split headlights, a rear light bar, an illuminated logo, two-tone wheels, and a swoopy roofline. The LED daytime running lights send a bit of a Hyundai vibe, but the boomerang-shaped lights below give the car a unique front fascia.
Some would be tempted to say this is Nissan’s first-ever electric sedan. However, that’s not the case. The Leaf-based Sylphy Zero Emission was launched in 2018 as the company’s first EV made for the Chinese market. Just how big is the N7? At 194 inches (4930 millimeters) long and 74.6 inches (1895 millimeters) wide, it’s roughly the same size as a Volkswagen ID.7. However, it sits closer to the road, at 58.5 inches (1487 millimeters) tall. It measures 114.7 inches (2915 millimeters) between the axles, so the wheelbase is a tad shorter than the VW’s.
Nissan isn’t willing to show the interior just yet, nor is it ready to divulge technical specifications beyond the car’s measurements. We do know it sits on a locally developed modular electric architecture and will be offered with a “Navigate on Autopilot” advanced driver-assist system. Inside, the touchscreen should run smoothly courtesy of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295P processor.
The N7 will go on sale in China during the first half of 2025. It’s one of several models included in Nissan’s “The Arc” midterm plan, which will allow the Dongfeng Nissan joint venture to accelerate the launch of hybrid and electric vehicles in China. This strategy calls for a total of 30 models globally by 2027, including seven vehicles for the United States.

The Porsche Taycan Gets Three New Models For 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/740686/porsche-taycan-updates-2025/,"Want a Porsche Taycan? On some level, of course you do. And now you have more options, ranging from 402 hp to 1,019 hp.",2024-11-12 10:00:00,"When it comes to modern electric vehicles, the Porsche Taycan is objectively tough to beat in almost every metric. It's fast, it looks fantastic and it's a top leader in range and charging times without sacrificing performance. And after some big upgrades this year, the Taycan lineup is growing to offer buyers even more ways to get one in 2025.
Porsche announced today that three new members of the updated Taycan family will on sale in the first quarter of 2025. The base sedan gets all-wheel-drive to become the Taycan 4 for the first time ever (previously, that was only available in Cross Turismo form) and the GTS trim returns in both sedan and Sport Turismo wagon forms. This means that there are now 13 flavors of Taycan to choose from, ranging in power from 402 hp to 1,019 hp.
""The new models have more power, longer range, accelerate faster and can be charged in less time and with greater stability,"" Porsche officials said in a news release. The simultaneous improvement of performance and efficiency is down to a number of factors: an advanced powertrain with a new rear-axle motor with up to 107 hp more power than its predecessor on all models, a modified pulse inverter with optimized software, more powerful batteries, revised thermal management, a next-generation heat pump, increased recuperation and optional all-wheel-drive strategy."" More importantly, at 800-volt DC charging stations, the Taycan models can charge at an extremely impressive 320 kW, making it one of the quickest-charging EVs around.
We'll start with the GTS models. This ""sporty all-rounder"" was the midpack Taycan model on the first generation of vehicles, offering tons of performance options without going completely nuts (in a good way, of course) like the Turbo and Turbo S variants above it. The updated Taycan debuted without the GTS models, but now they're here in sedan and wagon form.
The GTS gets up to 690 hp of ""overboost power"" when Launch Control is used, a full 100 hp more than its predecessor. And with the Sport Chrono package, the driver can add an additional 93 hp for 10 seconds on top of that. Both the sedan and Sport Turismo wagon will do zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds. The GTS even gets a ""sound profile"" that is unique to this model. Other GTS upgrades include the multifunction sport steering wheel, optional rear-axle steering, adaptive air suspension with torque vectoring, standard adaptive sport seats and retuned Porsche Active Ride. The GTS models starts at $147,900 for the sedan and $149,800 for the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, not including any dealer charges or the $1,995 destination fee.
But adding AWD to the base sedan is arguably the most exciting development here. It can be had with the standard Performance battery or the optional Performance Battery Plus battery, which put down 402 hp or 429 hp on overboost, respectively. The traction advantage of AWD lets the Taycan 4 hit 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, 0.1 seconds faster than the RWD car, without skimping on efficiency.
""Additionally, the front electric motor is electrically decoupled whenever traction, driving dynamics, and driving stability allow it. It then switches back on within milliseconds when needed, for example when accelerating or recuperating."" That one starts at $103,300, also excluding the destination fees.
With these additions, the updated Taycan family gets some selections in line with the first-generation EV, and then some. What's missing from today's release, however, is these models' electric range; we expect to hear more about that in the coming months.
Despite the Taycan's incredible performance and excellence as an EV, Porsche has had some challenges selling it lately—especially globally, and especially in China, where the electric competition is in incredibly fierce. Can these new models help get the job done?

It has three rows of seating as standard and the only powertrain option is a dual-motor setup good for 615 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. The zero to sixty miles per hour time is 3.7 seconds with Velocity Max enabled.

The two electric motors are powered by a 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a GM-estimated driving range of 300 miles. Charging is done via a CCS1 port located at the front-left of the vehicle, with Cadillac saying up to 79 miles of range can be added in 10 minutes when connected to a DC fast charger. The company didn’t say what the peak DC charging rate is, though.
On AC power, the Vistiq can gain up to 20.5 miles of range in an hour when hooked up to a 7.7-kilowatt charger and up to 28.5 miles when connected to an 11.5-kW home charger. With the optional 19.2-kW onboard charger, up to 46.7 miles of range can be added in an hour from a powerful enough Level 2 charger. Vehicle-to-home functionality is baked-in, but you’ll need GM Energy’s V2H Bundle to send power from the car’s battery to your home.
Size-wise, the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq is 205.5 inches long, 86.7 inches wide (without mirrors) and 71 inches tall, while the wheelbase is 121.8 inches. By comparison, the Kia EV9, another three-row electric SUV, is about 8 inches shorter, 9 inches narrower and 2 inches shorter. however, the wheelbase of the EV9 is a fifth of an inch longer than the Vistiq. The Kia EV9 is also available with rear-wheel drive only and has a lower starting price of $56,395, while the maximum range is 304 miles.
Another three-row electric SUV, the Rivian R1S, starts at $77,900. At this price, it comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive, 533 hp and an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles. Paying more will get you more power and more range–up to 410 miles. Compared to the Cadillac Vistiq, the Rivian R1S is roughly 5 inches shorter, 5 inches narrower and 6 inches taller when set in the maximum ride height. The wheelbase of the R1S is just seven-tenths of an inch shorter than the Vistiq.
Cadillac’s new electric crossover comes as standard with a 23-speaker AKG Studio audio system with Dolby Atmos, as well as Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free advanced driving assistance system that works on hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in North America. 21-inch wheels are also part of the standard pack, as well as a five-zone climate control system.
2026 Cadillac Vistiq
Optionally, the luxury EV can be specced with adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering and 23-inch wheels–you know, if you want that extra pizzazz. A Night Vision feature can also be fitted as a paid-for extra, which allows the driver to see pedestrians or animals on the screen during the night.
A huge, 33-inch diagonal LED screen adorns the dashboard, just like on the larger Escalade IQ. Depending on the trim level, the Vistiq gets either carbon fiber, open-pore wood or black ash wood decors inside. Speaking of trim levels, three will be available: Luxury, Sport and Premium Luxury.
Cadillac says the third row of seating is “comfort-conscious,” with padded armrests, smartphone storage, cupholders and USB chargers. That’s nice to hear, seeing how traditional three-row SUVs usually greet their rear-most passengers with little more than a side window.
2026 Cadillac Vistiq
“From the start, it was our team’s goal to deliver a three-row SUV that provides exhilarating performance and intuitive technology, wrapped in the brand’s iconic design language,” said Jeff MacDonald, North American chief engineer for the Vistiq. “Bold, yet refined, the Vistiq provides a comfortable ride while handling like a much smaller vehicle, delivering a sense of isolated precision.”
We’ll learn more about the Vistiq as its market launch inches closer, including its more official EPA range estimates and detailed pricing. Until that happens, though, you can let us know what you think of GM’s latest EV in the comments below.",Iulian Dnistran
The Polestar 2 Just Got More Expensive For 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/740590/polestar-2-2025-price-range/,"Blame tariffs or a shifting market, but the only Polestar 2 for 2025 is the Long-Range Dual-Motor Performance Pack at $66,200.",2024-11-11 14:14:57,"The Polestar 2 was one of the first electric vehicles to hit the market that really felt like it could match what Tesla was doing in terms of range, performance and technology. But as Volvo's corporate cousin Polestar continues the fight for EV supremacy, it's changing up its tactics when it steps into the ring for Round Two.
That may be bad news for anyone who has held out until model year 2025 to pick up a Polestar 2, however. The electric sedan will only be available in one trim level and configuration now, the most expensive one in the lineup. As Car and Driver discovered recently, the only 2025 Polestar 2 available to order new will be the Long Range, Dual Motor version with the Performance Pack. That means it will start at $64,800, or $66,200 including destination fees.
It unfortunately represents a sizable pricing jump from the 2024 Polestar 2, with far less flexibility in specs overall. That car could be had in Long-Range Rear-Wheel-Drive form starting at $51,300; Long-Range AWD form at $56,700; or the Long Range AWD Performance Pack that survived intact into 2025. (All prices include destination fees.) Last year, the Polestar 2 got a significant under-the-skin upgrade as well, going from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel-drive while getting upgraded motors, batteries and charging speeds. Those changes made it even better as one of our favorite Tesla alternatives and objectively one of the best sport sedans—electric or otherwise—on the market. And while the Polestar 2 never got to Tesla Model 3 levels of affordability, it did have some very enticing lease deals behind it since it did not qualify for any U.S. EV tax credits.
While these changes may be a bummer to some fans, they do make sense. The Polestar 2 is currently made in China, so its pricing appears to reflect the new 100% tariffs applied to EVs made in that country. Presumably, those tariffs caused the automaker to axe all but the most expensive versions of the car because it would've taken an absolute bath on anything else. And the pricing of the Polestar 2 now may mean the company is just eating the current tariffs. (We emailed Polestar representatives for comment and will update if we hear back.) Volvo did something similar with the also-China-made EX30: for now, until that car can be built in Europe, only its more expensive version will be sold stateside and potentially in limited quantities.
And it's also clear that Polestar's strategy is shifting away from the 2 to other models. As good as it is, it's always been a sedan in an SUV world, and sales have not been especially great lately—less than ideal as spent years as Polestar's sole model. Instead, Polestar seems to be emphasizing its future now: the Polestar 3 luxury crossover, and the upcoming Polestar 4 performance coupe-crossover.
Both will help Polestar avoid at least some of the pesky anti-China tariff problems. The Polestar 3 is being built right now in South Carolina alongside its mechanical cousin, the new Volvo EX90, and the Polestar 4 will be made in South Korea. The future of the Polestar 2 feels unclear, but the last we heard is that it could be replaced entirely with a sedan called the Polestar 7. Given how popular sedans are in other markets, including China, it's unlikely Polestar would go all-SUV just for Americans.
The good news is that if you want a Polestar 2, there are outstanding options on the used market right now. You can find a big glut of off-lease Polestar 2 sedans on Cars.com and other marketplaces for under $35,000 or even $30,000 (and if my own gas-powered Mazda 3 ever decides to eat it, I'll certainly be looking in that direction myself.)
And the 2025 Polestar 2 is, at the very least, a lot of car; you get 476 horsepower and 546 lb-ft of torque, max range of 254 miles, a zero to 60 mph time of four seconds flat, charging speeds up to 205 kW and a bunch of included options like Pilot Assist, the panoramic roof, a heat pump with heated seats and steering wheel, and more. Finally, with an adapter, it can now use the Tesla Supercharger network as well.
Is this still a solid deal for the Polestar 2, or would you go used instead?

"The Karma Invictus Is A Brand-New Car, Believe It Or Not",https://insideevs.com/news/740498/karma-invictus-performance-phev/,The ill-fated Fisker Karma lives on as a performance-oriented PHEV with carbon fiber bits.,2024-11-11 04:15:07,"After the somewhat ungracious downfall of Henrik Fisker’s latest automotive project, which ended with a widely reported bankruptcy case and thousands of Ocean EV owners desperately searching for answers, the idea that yet another Fisker-led automotive endeavor is in the works would be quite a sore point.
But rest assured, because this is not what it seems to be. This is the brand-new Karma Invictus, and it’s a freshly released performance version of the latest-generation Karma Revero plug-in hybrid. If the name Karma rings a bell, it’s because this car used to be manufactured by Fisker Automotive with a Karma badge on it. That company went bankrupt, as did Henrik Fisker’s second attempt at making a car from scratch, and its assets were scooped in 2014 up by another entity that chose to improve on the formula and continue selling the four-door sedan under a different name.
The Karma Invictus, then. It will be limited to just 30 units and each will come with carbon fiber front wheel arches, hood, roof and trunk. Under the skin, the Invictus gets Ohlins coil-overs with Swift sprints, an improved steering box that delivers more precise feedback.
More Stuff Like This
The powertrain is the same as in the regular Revero–a PHEV setup with two electric motors making a total of 536 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque, together with a 1.5-liter gas generator that has the job of providing energy to the 28-kilowatt-hour battery pack. However, because the Invictus is lighter than the latest Revero–though Karma didn’t say by how much–it can accelerate from zero to 60  miles per hour in an estimated 3.97 seconds, over half a second quicker than the model it’s based on.
The Invictus also wears sticky Michelin PS4S tires wrapped around black polished five-spoke forged aluminum wheels. The performance PHEV has 10-millimeter wider tires (295/35 R21) at the rear than at the front for improved grip. Karma Automotive says the Invictus is more predictable at the cornering limit and over uneven surfaces, which should make it a more involving drive.
Built in California, the Karma Invictus comes with anodized aluminum door sill plaques which can be inscribed to the client’s specifications. The seats–heated and ventilated at the front–are trimmed in an art-deco pattern reminiscent of New York’s Chrysler Building, the company said. Just like the Karma Revero it’s based on, the Invictus can travel up to 80 miles on all-electric power, while the total driving range with a full tank of gas is 360 miles.
“Karma Invictus takes an intense and visceral persona, amplifying its performance with a sharpened chassis paired with bespoke exterior and interior appointments to create a new identity for this legendary four-door GT,” said Marques McCammon, President, Karma Automotive. “As with the 3rd Generation Karma Revero, which begins delivering to clients later this month, Karma Invictus unleashes the potential of its space frame by marrying lightweight carbon fiber bodywork with our innovative hybrid Extended Range Electric powertrain.”
There’s no pricing or production timeline for the Invictus yet, but the luxury automaker said it will be available worldwide.",Iulian Dnistran
You've Never Seen An Audi Like This Before,https://insideevs.com/news/740248/audi-e-concept-shanghai-china/,Audi needs some wins in China. This wagon aims to do that 764 horsepower and 435 miles of electric range.,2024-11-07 15:20:44,"It's no secret that the Volkswagen Group has not had an amazing time in 2024. It's struggled with slumping sales in China, once its biggest market, while it faces intense Chinese competition back home. It's staring down factory closures and layoffs as costs mount. All the while, China's electric auto industry is powering forward while other parts of the world enter ""wait and see"" mode.
But today in Shanghai, Audi showed that it's not taking this situation lying down. Meet its latest concept and brand: the Audi E Concept, from AUDI. Yes, all-caps ""to signal both the connection to and differentiation from the sister brand,"" which in this case would simply be Audi. While that's certainly an odd branding decision that kind of reminds me of that old Marc Jacobs meme, the concept itself looks great, the specs are impressive and its mission is extremely clear: get right in China before it's too late.
AUDI E Concept
“By launching this new brand for electric and intelligent models in China, Audi is breaking new ground to tap into new and more tech-savvy customer segments,"" Audi's global CEO, Gernot Döllner, said in a news release. ""The upcoming models are aimed at a promising and simultaneously demanding new customer segment. The cooperation will further expand the Audi portfolio of battery electric vehicles in China and accelerate the company’s transformation in the world’s largest market.”
What is clear is that this electric concept is by China and for Chinese buyers. That's because appealing to that group has become a persistent problem for the Western automakers who once thought the world's largest car market would be a kind of permanent cash cow. Lately, that hasn't been the case. Homegrown Chinese automakers have not only dramatically advanced in EV and battery tech, but they also know how to appeal to the very particular tastes and likes of Chinese car owners: no buttons, lots of interior lighting, big screens, tons of connected tech and convenience features and more.
It's no wonder then that Audi partnered with China's SAIC for this one, which also includes an entirely new electric platform called the Advanced Digitized Platform. That should spawn at least three new full-size and midsize EVs, all getting to market 30% faster to match the lightning speed of China's other automakers.
AUDI E Concept
""The new joint program offers the best of two worlds in automotive development. It combines the strengths of Audi with SAIC’s innovation speed,"" the automaker said in a news release. ""Audi brings know-how in premium products and design, overall vehicle development, and engineering to the table. SAIC offers fast innovations, a well-established technology ecosystem, and deep insight into the local market’s demands.""
And the Audi E Concept is on the full-size side of things. It's a little longer than an Audi Q6 E-Tron crossover, about as wide and lower and sleeker overall. The grille is a radical departure from anything Audi's done in the past, ditching the iconic four-ring logo for the name in all-caps. (I'd also argue it looks a bit more interesting than Audi's current, overly fussy design language.)
AUDI E Concept
The specs are where it really shines. The concept car has a 100 kWh battery and dual-motor all-wheel-drive estimated at 700 km (435 miles) of electric range on China's generous CLTC testing cycle. It has an 800-volt architecture and can supposedly add a staggering 230 miles of range in 10 minutes. It's quick, too, with 764 horsepower and a zero to 60 mph time of 3.6 seconds.
On the inside, drivers and passengers get a ""pillar-to-pillar"" 4K curved display, digital mirrors, very few buttons and an ""AUDI OS"" software setup with facial recognition, an AI virtual assistant and other customizable tech features. In short, it feels like something from Xiaomi or Nio, but from Audi.
AUDI E Concept
And that's exactly the point. This is why Audi wanted to team up with SAIC in the first place. While it's still ramping up modern EVs for customers in the U.S. and Europe, to compete in China, it needs to play the same game those competitors are playing right now. I remember a time when a China-specific model would mean cringey dragon graphics and things like that; now, the automakers are catching up after getting leapfrogged on technology.
Will these Audi E models make their way to Europe and the U.S.? Given the current backlash with tariffs and crackdowns on software, I find the latter especially unlikely. But I wish Audi would find some way to get this tech to trickle down elsewhere, because it definitely seems to be in a different league.

The Carmaker Behind The Shelby Cobra Is Building A Brand-New Retro-Flavored EV,https://insideevs.com/news/740140/ac-ace-classic-ev-roadster-tremec/,"It’s called the AC Ace Classic Electric and it’s beautiful. It’s also very light, despite packing a 72-kWh battery.",2024-11-07 04:14:28,"Your eyes are not deceiving you, rest assured. The delightfully simple red roadster you see above is not some sort of Shelby Cobra knockoff, but it does have a lot in common with the legendary name that established the United States as a serious contender on the international racing stage, winning the FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1965.
That’s because it’s made by AC Cars, the company that supplied the chassis to Shelby, who then fitted the signature Ford V8 and transmission stateside. But unlike the iconic Cobra, this little red thing is electric.
It’s called the AC Ace Classic Electric and it’s a brand-new car made in collaboration with car parts giant Tremec. Tipping the scales at just 2,425 pounds, the British EV has a hand-laid carbon fiber body and a hand-finished interior. It’s very similar to the original AC Ace that provided the base for the brawny Shelby Cobra but without the aggressive flaring and side exhausts.
The reinterpreted classic is powered by a Tremec-developed drivetrain. A single, rear-mounted electric motor makes 301 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, enough to propel the skinny EV to 62 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. A rather beefy 72-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides “over 200 miles” of range and can be DC fast charged, although the company didn’t say how many kilowatts it can accept from a Level 3 stall.
AC Cars says the Ace Electric has a 50:50 front-to-rear weight distribution, which means it should be quite nimble on a twisty track–the low weight also helps. Two versions will be available: the Ace Classic Electric with the open grille design of the original Ace and the Ace Bristol Classic Electric with the earlier “smiling face” that debuted back in 1953. That said, AC Cars, which describes itself as Britain’s oldest active vehicle manufacturer, also offers a bespoke service for clients who want to customize their EV.
The electric AC Ace Classic is on display at the Tremec stand at this year’s SEMA show in Las Vegas. Production is set to start next year with an initial run of just 45 units, each with a starting price of $275,000 before taxes. The retro-flavored EV will be available in both left- and right-hand drive and each car will come with a brand-new VIN.

"The Volvo EX30 Is Finally Coming To America At $44,900",https://insideevs.com/news/740089/volvo-ex30-us-debut-price/,"After getting spiked by tariffs earlier this year, the still-China-built EX30 will arrive in dual-motor form soon.",2024-11-06 15:52:50,"The Volvo EX30 is finally coming to America. Yes, really.
Volvo Cars USA announced today that deliveries of the compact electric crossover will start going to people who pre-ordered them last year. And the U.S.-spec EX30 comes with a familiar price tag as well: $44,900 (or $46,195 including destination) for what Volvo said is its most requested trim level, the 422 hp EX30 Twin Motor Performance.
A Volvo spokesperson confirmed the EX30 is still being built at parent company Geely Group's factory in Zhangjiakou, China, so that price does include the new 100% tariffs on Chinese-built EVs—the reason the car was delayed earlier this summer. The EX30's configurator has also returned to Volvo's U.S. website. For those who pre-ordered the cars, deliveries will begin ""before the end of this year,"" the automaker said in a news release.
The dual-motor all-wheel-drive EX30 can be had in Plus trim or the more loaded Ultra version, which adds Park Pilot Assist Pilot Assist, Lane Change Assist and other features for $47,895, including destination.
Interestingly, the $44,900 base price for the Twin Motor Performance version is right in line with what Volvo announced earlier this year, so its price seemingly did not increase with the tariffs. Volvo initially announced the Single Motor Extended Range model would start at $34,950, making it the cheapest Volvo on sale. That version will come in 2025, Volvo said; its updated pricing has not been announced.
At the same time, Volvo seems to be hedging its bets somewhat on deliveries of the China-built EX30 models. Automotive News reported that it “remains to be seen” if the U.S. will receive additional China-made EX30s beyond this initial shipment: “If there is a way that we can get a few more cars through, we may take that,” said Jim Nichols, head of Product and Technology Consumer Offer at Volvo Car USA. “We also want to see what the response is going to be with our reservation holders.”
In other words, the car may really begin selling in force in 2025 when its production is moved to Ghent, Belgium. That may not begin until the third quarter of 2025 as well.
The EX30 has had a wild ride to get here. The car debuted in New York in July 2023 where it wowed onlookers with its compact size, sleek looks and $35,000-ish starting price tag. Volvo initially planned to build the car in China in order to achieve that low cost; it's the most affordable Volvo ever made. The specs were impressive, too. The Single Motor Extended Range EX30 has 268 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque with a range of 275 miles, while the Twin Motor Performance has 422 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. Volvo claimed that model can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds, also making it Volvo’s quickest-ever production car. Many excited fans—myself included, once—put in pre-orders for the car not long after its debut.
But the EX30 quickly fell victim to geopolitics. When the Biden administration announced steeper tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, Volvo hit pause on its debut plans to figure out how, when and even if the car could be sold stateside. At the time, many assumed those tariffs would mean a much higher price than initially announced. While Volvo had always planned to also build the EX30 in Belgium to satisfy anticipated European demand for the car, that now seems to be the linchpin on which U.S. volume sales will ultimately depend. (The EX30 is currently on sale in both Canada and Mexico.)
It is, however, great news for EX30 fans who worried they would miss out. The car has since garnered rave reviews, awards and is racking up strong sales in Europe and elsewhere. Can it eventually pull off a repeat here? Time will tell, but for now, Americans are finally getting the great option they wanted.

Suzuki Boss Says Making The Jimny An EV Would “Ruin” It. But Would It?,https://insideevs.com/news/739973/suzuki-jimny-ev-not-happening/,"A light, fun, cheap all-electric Jimny would make a lot of sense, albeit a short-range one.",2024-11-06 03:34:19,"Suzuki hasn’t sold a new car in the United States since 2012, but in other parts of the world, it’s still alive and kicking. That said, what is arguably the Japanese automaker’s most recognizable model, the venerable Jimny, isn’t the shining star it used to be.
In Europe, Suzuki has been forced to sell the pint-sized off-roader exclusively as a commercial vehicle in a two-seater configuration, which limits its already shrinking market. As fun and quirky as the Jimny may be–and it excels in both these categories–it’s still a slow, boxy off-roader that sits on an old-school ladder frame chassis and uses solid axles front and rear. The fact that it’s powered by a relatively asthmatic 1.5-liter gasoline engine doesn’t help either.
I’d argue that the Jimny–the Samurai’s successor–is the perfect candidate for electrification. A cheap, small and fun off-roader would be a great alternative to open-top side-by-sides or UTVs, but Suzuki boss Toshihiro Suzuki begs to differ. Speaking during the launch of the all-new eVitara, the automaker’s first EV, the automaker’s head honcho suggested that a battery-powered Jimny is out of the question.
More Stories Like This
“If you talk about the Jimny EV, I think it would ruin the best part of the Jimny,” Suzuki said, quoted by Autocar. “I think the core strength of the Jimny is the right weight.” He added that the company intends to continue offering the Jimny to “professionals” (i.e. commercial customers) and that using e-fuel or biofuel would enable the off-roader to stay on sale for longer.
Let’s address that weight problem, though. The latest-generation gas-powered Jimny tips the scales at an impressively low 2,414 pounds for the two-door version and 2,612 pounds for the four-door version. (Yes, there’s a four-door, too.) By comparison, the new eVitara, which is a unibody crossover, starts at 3,752 lbs for the standard-range, two-wheel drive trim and goes all the way to 4,186 lbs for the long-range, four-wheel drive variant.
That’s a big difference, but an all-electric Jimny could make do with a smaller battery. The eVitara can be had with either a 49- or a 61-kilowatt-hour battery, but let’s not forget that the entry-level Nissan Leaf comes with a 40-kWh pack, so why wouldn’t the Jimny go down the same route? Obviously, the range would take a hit, but there are plenty of people out there commuting in the 149-mile base Leaf. Add a bit of Jimny fun to the mix, and a potentially winning formula comes into view.
It’s not like the gas-powered Jimny is a highway cruiser anyway, with a rather bumpy ride and noisy interior. Making it electric would only make it better, but what do you think?",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Cybertruck Deliveries Begin In Canada As U.S. Demand Cools,https://insideevs.com/news/739906/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-canada/,"Tesla made the Cybertruck available for preorder in Canada in August starting, at $137,990 CAD.",2024-11-05 13:00:26,"With the high number of Tesla Cybertruck sightings from Canada popping up online, it can only mean one thing: Tesla has officially kicked off deliveries up north. In Canada, the Cybertruck currently costs $137,990 CAD in dual-motor guise or $165,990 for the tri-motor Cyberbeast. There’s an additional $2,750 CAD destination fee that you need to add on top of that.
Only the Foundation Series is currently available in Canada, but it’s been dropped in the U.S. making it $20,000 cheaper, we anticipate that Canada will soon follow suit and allow you to order a more affordable non-Foundation Series truck. Don't expect an even lower price, though, as the $61,000 single-motor rear-wheel-drive model is likely no longer in the cards.
The Cybertruck order books in Canada were opened in August. However, regardless of when you placed your order, you shouldn't have to wait months for a Cybertruck's delivery—your truck should arrive within a few weeks now that the backlog of orders in the U.S. has cleared. The Canadian version of the Tesla website estimates delivery in either November or December.
The delivery schedule is for the Foundation Series, and Tesla is able to deliver these trucks so quickly because it’s probably already shipped them over to Canada. You may have to wait longer for a non-Foundation Series truck to become available in Canada.
More Tesla Cybertruck Stories
If you want the Range Extender (which is just an extra battery, not an actual generator that uses fuel to add miles), it will set you back CAD 22,000. It increases the dual-motor truck’s range from 512 kilometers (337 miles) to over 755 km (445 miles), but its production has been pushed back to the middle of 2025.
Making the Cybertruck legal for Canadian roads required an exemption since the country currently prohibits vehicles with steer-by-wire on its public roads. Apparently, the issue was that the steering wheels of vehicles registered in Canada needed to turn 270 degrees for them to be legal, and the Cybertruck’s didn’t. Interestingly, the exemption remains in place only until 2029, so these trucks could become illegal to drive in a few years unless the law changes in the meantime.
While the exemption is in place, Tesla will have to supply Transport Canada with regular incident reports about the steer-by-wire system as well as the intervention of the truck’s electronic stability control. The manufacturer is limiting Cybertruck sales to North America this year, but starting in 2025 it wants to expand sales elsewhere, especially in Europe, where grey imports are already underway. It's not yet clear whether the Cybertruck is legal for European roads and whether it will ever officially go on sale on the continent without serious changes.

The Chevrolet Silverado EV Is Getting A Diagonal Driving Feature,https://insideevs.com/news/739674/chevrolet-silverado-ev-sidewinder-diagonal-steering/,"A software update will enable older Silverado EVs to move diagonally, just like the GMC Hummer EV and Sierra EV.",2024-11-04 03:29:34,"The 2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV recently debuted with more range and a lower starting price, making it an even more appealing option than ever. However, General Motors, Chevrolet’s parent company, has another ace up its sleeve in the all-electric pickup game. (Or maybe it just forgot to mention this cool new feature you saw in the headline, I don’t know.)
It’s called Sidewinder, and it’s exactly the same as the GMC Hummer EV’s CrabWalk feature, just under a different name. Seeing how the more expensive Silverado EV trims come as standard with four-wheel steering, the newly added Sidewinder showpiece enables the battery-powered truck to move diagonally by turning all four wheels in the same direction.
Drivers can enable the feature from the Rear Steering page on the central infotainment screen and drive like a crab at up to 20 miles per hour, according to GM. It should come in handy, especially in tight parking spaces and off-road.
Sidewinder comes as standard on the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST, while the 2024 Silverado EV RST First Edition will receive the feature via an over-the-air software update–including vehicles that are still on dealer lots and those that have been sold.
The Silverado EV was GM’s only electric pickup that didn’t have a diagonal driving feature, even though it comes with rear-wheel steering. The GMC Hummer EV broke the ice with the so-called “CrabWalk,” followed by the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1.
Revealed last month, the updated Silverado EV offers even more range than before–up to 492 miles for the fleet-oriented WT trim with the Max Range battery pack–and a lower starting price of $57,095 including destination for the entry-level WT with the newly introduced Standard Range battery pack. We still don’t know how far the base Work Truck will go on a full charge, as Chevrolet has yet to publish that figure.
Meanwhile, the retail-oriented LT with the Extended Range battery starts at $75,195. This one is EPA-rated at 408 miles on a full charge, while the fancier RST trim with the same battery is rated at 390 miles. The RST is also the most expensive of the bunch, with a starting price of $89,395. The RST with Max Range battery, which enables a GM-estimated range of 460 miles, will set you back $97,895.

Hyundai Initium Hydrogen Concept Shows Where Design Is Headed Next,https://insideevs.com/news/739422/hyundai-initium-concept-design-language/,It’s powered by a hydrogen fuel cell that provides a maximum range of 404 miles. And it can power your home.,2024-10-31 09:00:49,"Hyundai is changing its design language again, even though it didn’t even get to implement its last one across its entire global lineup. The new styling direction, which is called “Art of Steel,” looks like an evolution of what Hyundai has been doing with its Ioniq range of models with a bit more of a retro influence. And it will be previewed by a hydrogen-powered concept that not only looks interesting but can do some interesting things.
That concept is called the Hyundai Initium, which will be unveiled at the 2024 Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Powering the concept is a hydrogen fuel cell system that runs a 201 horsepower motor and it gives the Initium a claimed range of 404 miles (650 km) on one tank. That’s more than its predecessor, the Nexo, which could only manage 378 miles (609 km) and had 40 horsepower less.
Hyundai actually intends to produce the Initium starting in 2025, presumably as a replacement for the Nexo FCEV introduced in 2018, which in turn served as a replacement for the iX35 FCEV. Just like its hydrogen fuel cell predecessors, which only sold a couple thousand cars a year globally at best (most of them in South Korea), the Initium FCEV won’t be an important model for Hyundai on the world stage. But it will be important from a technology perspective—Hyundai, along with a few other automakers, aren't giving up on hydrogen fuel cells even as they invest vastly more resources into battery EVs.
The Initium’s design is pretty bold, with excellent proportions, bulging wheel arches and simple fascias that feature light clusters with a pixel-like design. The C-pillar area must have been inspired by the Pontiac Aztek, because it looks very similar, including its slanted fastback-style rear glass. The concept’s 21-inch wheels feature aerodynamic covers to help reduce drag, but they also look pretty sporty as far as aero wheels go.
More Hyundai EV Stories
According to Hyundai’s design boss, SangYup Lee, ""Our challenge began from the manufacturing stage, where we pushed the formability of steel to the extreme to create a form of art. With Initium, we’ve crafted a more SUV-like design that is both solid and safe, reflecting our dedication to our customers through 'customer-centric design’.” Hyundai is getting ready to reveal an updated version of the Ioniq 6, which may incorporate some elements of the “Art of Steel” design.
Hyundai Initium concept
While much of the focus for hydrogen power has turned to commercial vehicles, large trucks and industrial applications, Hyundai is one of the few automakers that thinks it could have legs for passenger cars. The Koreans are committed to keeping hydrogen in the lineup as a way to help them achieve the goal of meeting its net zero carbon goals by 2045.
The manufacturer doesn’t say if the Initium is built on a new platform or a modified version of an existing one, but like Hyundai’s EVs, it will have bidirectional charging with vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities. A Hyundai official told Car and Driver that the Initium's 100 kWh of offboard juice is ""enough to power a typical Korean home for around 10 days.""
Will buyers warm up to this hydrogen vehicle more than others? As always, that may depend on the infrastructure, but at least the Initium has route-planning for that as well. Let's hope it will actually have stations to find when it goes on sale.",Andrei Nedelea
Very Original: Mopar EV-Swapped Plymouth GTX,https://www.motor1.com/news/739152/mopar-plymouth-gtx-electromod/,"The GTX Electromod showcases a potential EV conversion kit, so you too can remove the one thing that defines a classic muscle car.",2024-12-25 09:02:26,"Among the many gasoline and electric vehicles on display at SEMA this year will be a deliciously blue 1967 Plymouth GTX. Don't get excited about the wild V-8 engine under the hood of this modified muscle car, however. In its place is a single electric motor driving the rear wheels.
It's called the Plymouth GTX Electromod Concept, and it comes from Mopar, the decades-old parts division of Chrysler that is now the parts group for all of Stellantis. Back in the 1960s, Mopar dished out all kinds of performance upgrades for pretty much every V-8 in the Chrysler family. That includes the GTX, which debuted in 1967 as a humble Belvedere two-door hardtop muscled up with two engine options: a 375-horsepower 440 cubic inch (7.2) V-8, or the legendary 426 Hemi.
Flash forward to 2024, and Mopar is testing the waters with a conceptual electric conversion kit for classic cars. Called the e-Crate, it's not unlike the various Hellcat setups currently available for custom builds. At the heart is a 400-volt, 250-kilowatt electric drive module that installs neatly under the hood using custom mounts. Power comes from four battery packs, three of which are mounted in the trunk. The fourth is positioned up front behind the grille for better weight distribution, which is important considering each pack weighs 230 pounds. The system is rated for 73 kilowatt-hours and gives the GTX an estimated range of 250 miles.
But range and efficiency were never defining factors for a muscle car. It's all about power, and on that front, this GTX Electromod makes ""approximately 335 horsepower and torque,"" according to Mopar. That's less than the car's original 440, never mind the Hemi. There is no transmission; it goes to the rear wheels through a 3:1 gear reducer. So at least there's very little (if any) driveline loss. Performance stats aren't mentioned.
The rest of the car features typical restomod upgrades. It has a lowered suspension with 18-inch wheels and Wilwood disc brakes at all four corners. A custom hood is made from carbon fiber, and at the back, the wheel arches are wider. Bumpers front and rear are trimmed for a cleaner fit, and you won't find a lick of chrome anywhere. The blue interior has some personality, with bronze and stainless steel trim on the dash and door panels. There are new seats, a new center console, and digital gauges behind a retro-themed steering wheel. The Mopar team also added a cupholder, because all muscle cars need a cupholder.
This certainly isn't the first time we've seen a major automaker EV-swap a classic muscle car. And with the future still rolling (albeit slower) towards electric power, we doubt this will be the last.

2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/739100/2026-cadillac-lyriq-v/,"Cadillac's award-winning crossover is about to put the ""V"" in ""EV,"" and we're all better for it. The performance variant debuts next year.",2024-10-29 08:00:48,"I think even the most die-hard electric vehicle fan has to admit that General Motors has put out some truly first-rate gas-powered performance cars over the past decade-and-a-half. The C7 and C8 Corvettes, the last (for now, anyway) Chevy Camaro and the various Cadillac V-Series sedans have taken on the world and often come out on top. But GM has also had a surprisingly strong EV game as of late. I've been wondering when those two trends might converge, and today, we have an answer.
Meet the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V. Its somewhat awkward name tells you exactly what it is: the award-winning Cadillac Lyriq electric crossover, just with the V-Series treatment for high performance.
2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V
""The 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V, the first electric SUV to earn the V-Series badge, will join the brand portfolio early next year,"" Cadillac officials said in a news release. ""Lyriq-V is a stunning technical achievement, pushing the performance pedigree of the preeminent sub-brand to new heights.""
So what else do we know about it? Well, for now, nothing. That's it. Just that and a short teaser video of a Lyriq-V whooshing almost silently across a race track. We can see several exterior tweaks, including a different grille and color-matched wheel arches, and V badges inside and out. And the teaser video clearly shows the driver activating some kind of performance settings with the V button on the steering wheel. Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see what Cadillac is cooking up.
We have some things we can deduce, of course. The normal dual-motor all-wheel-drive Lyriq is no slouch with 500 horsepower and a zero to 60 mph time under five seconds (plus a healthy 307 miles of electric range.) The Lyriq-V could also end up as a Chevrolet Blazer EV SS in a business suit; that crossover will pack 595 horsepower and be capable of zero to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds with its full-blast ""Wide Open Watts"" mode engaged. But given the lengths Cadillac's V-Series team has gone in the past to make those cars feel special, I don't think the Lyriq-V will be just some reskin of the Chevy.
I'm quite excited to see what GM comes up with here, and even more glad the V-Series will have a future in the electric era. But GM set the bar pretty high with the CTS-V and the like; if the Lyriq-V can live up to that legacy, it's going to be a very interesting machine indeed.

Hyundai Gave The Kona A Weird Off-Road Makeover,https://www.motor1.com/news/738706/hyundai-kona-off-road-version/,It's named after the Earth's largest active volcano and looks like a 1990s base model.,2024-12-25 09:02:27,"Seemingly out of nowhere, there's a limited-run special edition of the electric Kona in Japan. Hyundai calls it the ""Mauna Loa"" after the biggest active volcano in the world. Painted in Mirage Green, the small crossover has been turned into a pseudo-offroader with Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires.
The chunky rubber measures 205/65 R16 and is combined with matte black wheels supplied by Weds. For better off-road chops, Hyundai installs smaller wheels compared to the regular model's 17-inch set with 215/60 R17 tires. We're not entirely sure whether that was the intention but the new wheels seem to mimic bedlock wheels used by proper go-anywhere vehicles.
Addressing the elephant in the room, the bumpers and side skirts make the Mauna Loa look like a base model from the 1990s. While those cars had unpainted bumpers to keep the price low, the Kona's are sprayed with scratch-resistant paint. That should make the body panels more durable when you’re off the beaten path in your electric Kona. Hyundai calls it a ""unique uneven finish"" with a textured look that has a ""subdued shine.""
Rounding off the upgrades on the outside are mudguards on all four wheels, black weatherstripping, dark badges, and standard roof bars for extra practicality. Stepping inside, Hyundai installs easy-to-clean floor mats and a cargo mat made from rubber as well. Much like the body, the interior is also predominantly green but with neon yellow accents for a contrasting effect.
Although the Kona Mauna Loa caters to outdoorsy people, Hyundai insisted on covering the seats in leather upholstery. We'd reckon cloth would've made more sense since it's easier to clean and more durable in time. Elsewhere, customers can get a few more accessories, including a folding chair and storage pockets that can be attached to the back of the front seats. Two different-sized cargo boxes are also available.
Hyundai is making only 30 units of the Kona Mauna Loa and is charging 4.95 million yen. At current exchange rates, that works out to about $32,500, making it about $2,800 more expensive than the electric Kona Voyage upon which it's based. It has the bigger 64.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for 336 miles.

"Scout Traveler And Terra: Off-Road EVs That Offer Gas Generators, Too",https://insideevs.com/news/738669/scout-traveler-terra-revealed/,"Scout's first EVs will offer incredible off-road capability, direct-consumer sales and zero range anxiety. We're excited.",2024-10-24 18:30:00,"I've waited a long time to see what Scout, Volkswagen's revived off-road brand, would bring to the table. The company made big promises: The return of a storied nameplate, a new chance for VW to build real momentum in America, new software, a new factory and extreme off-road capability. But I had my doubts. I don't trust VW's vision as a company, and I wasn't sure if Scout could stick the landing. But with the reveal of the Terra truck and Traveler SUV on Thursday, Scout blew away my expectations. The company made all of the right decisions. The products look great.
More Scout Info
They offer pure-EV or ""extended-range EV"" powertrains, with 350 miles of all-electric range and up to 500 miles when using the available gasoline generator. The designs look great, the interiors look solid, the capability looks promising and the charging specs look incredible. They're built in America with battery sourcing that ensures they'll qualify for the full $7,500 federal incentive, and the pricing looks about right. The Terra and Traveler have everything they need to succeed in America. Scout just has to get them to market. Both are technically ""concepts"" for now, but they look nearly production-ready.
Let's jump into what they are, why they matter and the road ahead.
Scout is a beloved name in the off-road community, as the original International Harvester Scout was a phenomenal off-roader. It was simple, durable and capable, and a perfect inspiration for an off-road brand. When the Volkswagen Group acquired the rights to the Scout name upon purchasing the heavy duty trucking firm that controlled International, the company took the opportunity to launch a redefined brand for an electric era. The company announced the name a couple of years back, and now we finally know about the products.
The Traveler and Terra are two separate products, but the fundamentals are the same. They are both body-on-frame vehicles built on an EV-oriented truck platform, bespoke to Scout. Scout says they'll take advantage of ""zonal architectures,"" a design term borrowed from new VW partner Rivian, which uses the new method of construction to simplify production and service while cutting costs. But the Scout's electrical architecture is more advanced than even the Rivian R1's, with an 800-volt-class system enabling increased efficiency and blinding-fast charging.
The Traveler, Scout's SUV.
If you don't want to worry about public fast charging, though, Scout is selling an ""extended-range electric vehicle"" version of the Terra and Traveler. The ""EREV""—a term popularized by the upcoming Ram Ramcharger—incorporates a gasoline generator to charge the battery. In a nod to the brand's history, Scout calls the gasoline generator the ""Harvester."" It never directly powers the wheels, though, separating this from a hybrid design.
The EREV design means that the Scout can go up to 500 miles on a charge and a tank. Opt for the EV-only version of either the Terra or the Traveler and you'll get up to 350 miles of range, putting them roughly on par with existing long-range trucks. Charge times should be considerably faster than the segment average, though. Scout says the Terra and Traveler support up to 350-kW charging speeds, maxing out the fastest chargers you'll find today. There's no claim for a 10-80% charging time, but expect it to land well under 30 minutes. Sub-20 minutes seems possible. The Scouts will come with Tesla's North American Charging System (NACS) plug from the factory, too, so you'll be able to charge at Superchargers from the rip.
Scout will offer a dual-motor four-wheel-drive system The company says there will be a solid rear axle—something beloved by hard-core off-roaders and unavailable in any EV off-roader so far—and mechanically locking front and rear differentials.
The Terra pickup truck gets a 5.5-foot bed.
Those top-end trucks should be able to knock off the 0-60 sprint in 3.5 seconds, thanks to ""nearly 1,000 lb-ft of torque,"" per the release. Perhaps more relevant to truck buyers, the Terra will be able to tow over 10,000 lbs. The Traveler—that's the SUV—will be limited to a bit over 7,000 lbs of towing capacity, which is unsurprising as shorter-wheelbase SUVs almost always tow less than their long-wheelbase, pickup truck counterparts. Both offer 2,000 lbs of payload, which shames any internal-combustion midsize pickup on sale. So you shouldn't have to worry about how much gear you bring on your overlanding trips.
Speaking of which, Scout says both trucks will offer over a foot of ground clearance in their most capable specifications. They can fit 35-inch tires and ford three feet of water. Finally, they can power all of your gear with a plethora of 120-volt outlets and USB-C ports. The Terra will even offer a 240-volt outlet in its 5.5-foot pickup bed with enough oomph to power construction tools and appliances. Both vehicles offer a full-size spare, too, which is huge for off-roading. Scout also says the frunk of both the Terra and Traveler are big enough to fit a bag of golf clubs, or a cooler.
Scout was clear to InsideEVs: The company isn't going to make the same mistake as many competitors (and even its parent company) in eschewing buttons completely. The Terra and Traveler offer tough-looking buttons for key controls, with rugged-looking accents throughout the interior.
Scout's all-new software interface will be called ""Scout Community UX."" The company says you won't have to dig through menus to access core features.
The concept images show an awesome design inside, with brown leather/leatherette seats and fabric accents. It's a good mix of clean, modern design with user-friendly accents. It remains to be seen whether Scout can stick the landing on software, which has proven to be a pain point for VW. But Scout's doing its own work here, and may benefit from the new tie-in with Rivian.
But this isn't a vehicle that's going to be defined by its tech. Instead, it offers another selling point to its outdoorsy clientele. The Traveler will offer a retractable ""Cabana Top"" that provides a giant opening to the outdoors. It's the size of a large panoramic roof, but fully opening. Scout claims it will be one of the largest roof opening in any SUV. If you don't want that, though, you can get a panoramic roof.
There will also be a three-person front bench seat available, which I absolutely love. It'll even be available on higher trims, so you don't need a stripper-spec work truck to have six-passenger utility. That alone has put the Scout Terra on my ""want to own"" list.
The Traveler's optional open-air ""Cabana Top.""
Here, I was expecting bad news. Scout is promising a lot, and over-promising can lead to cost growth pretty quickly. But I think the price is reasonable: Including tax credits, the Traveler will start ""as low as $50,000."" The pickup version will star around $51,500, also with the tax credit factored in. Ignoring the tax credit—which could change at any time—both vehicles will start under $60,000.
That's a reasonable price for this kind of vehicle. Many Jeep Wrangler, Ford Bronco and Toyota 4Runner customers already pay over $50,000. The Toyota Land Cruiser starts in the mid-$50,000 range, too.
It looks great. It also looks like a Rivian.
The real question is whether the $50,000 version will be a vehicle you want. The 1,000 lb-ft truck with the range extender sounds incredible. But it's too early to know whether Scout can deliver the experience customers want for $50,000. I can easily see the real-world price being in the $60,000 range for most models. But Scout's top-end EVs will have one huge advantage over the most sought-after Wrangler 392s, Bronco Raptors and 4Runner TRD Pros.
The Scout Terra and Traveler will be sold directly to consumers via factory stores. That means fixed pricing and no markups, something that can be hard to avoid on many of the Scout's most desirable competitors.
But that also poses a risk: Scout will have to deploy stores quickly, especially if it wants to capture more rural buyers who will be most excited by an off-roader. The company also needs to find a way to differentiate itself from Rivian, another EV adventure brand with zonal architectures and, likely, similar software. The range extender and price should separate it from the R1, but Rivian plans to launch the smaller, more affordable R2 before either Scout reaches the market.
The Traveler gets a swing-out full-size spare tire. On the Terra, the full-size spare will live under the bed.
Direct-to-consumer brands have also struggled to develop their service networks fast enough. But Scout says 80% of repairs on either truck should be doable outside of a Scout service center, ""whether in a driveway or while adventuring."" If Scout is able to leverage VW's existing service network, that could be a huge advantage, but there's no word on that yet. Scout also says the stores will offer a variety of accessories, including bumpers with exposed recovery points, auxiliary lighting options and even winches.
Now the bad news: Not until 2027. Scout says initial production will begin at its South Carolina factory sometime in that year, but that's all we know. If low-volume production starts in late 2027, it could leave most buyers waiting until 2028 for their vehicles.
Both the Terra and Traveler look sophisticated, interesting and competitive now. But it's hard to know where the market will be in 2027. Nobody knows if tax credits will still exist by then. Rivian could also be a mainstream company by then, or it could be gone. Tesla could be an AI company primarily making robots, or a reborn automaker with an adult at the helm.
Wouldn't be a 2020's vehicle without a full-width light bar and a light-up badge, now, would it?
So we don't know what sort of market the Terra and Traveler will enter. But right now, both products look exactly on target. Scout has managed to carve out a beautiful niche, as a tech-forward, ground-up company with the experience and resources of a giant global automaker. It's approached these vehicles with an incredible clarity of purpose, and it's possible that it'll be one of the few truly successful, direct-to-consumer, EV-focused companies in the U.S. But first, it has to hold our attention for the next three years.
That's a tall order, but I've learned not to underestimate Scout. If you like it, and you believe in the company, you can reserve one today here.
Correction: 10/25/24 at 1:40 P.M.: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Scout Terra and Traveler would offer quad-motor four-wheel-drive systems, with a motor per axle. That is incorrect. The Scouts will offer four-wheel drive with two motors, one on each axle. The story has been updated to be accurate. We regret the error.

The 2025 Ford E-Transit Costs The Same As The Gas Version,https://insideevs.com/news/738554/2025-ford-e-transit-price-range-specs/,"That’s the upfront cost. When you factor in the potential incentives and much lower running costs, the numbers are even better.",2024-10-24 03:33:15,"The 2025 Ford E-Transit electric van is here, and I’ll be honest: There isn’t really any technical change compared to the outgoing model. However, it’s in the pricing department where things get interesting because the 2025 E-Transit costs the same as “comparable” gas-powered Transit models, according to Ford.
The (very lightly) updated electric commercial van starts at $51,000. The 2025 E-Transit Chassis Cab goes for $46,200 and the Cutaway model starts at an even lower $47,700.
But it gets better. Ford is also throwing in a $2,000 rebate toward an EV charger and the associated installation costs. Additionally, the electric van is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit for commercial vehicles and the running costs are significantly lower than the gas version–a reduction of up to 48% in scheduled maintenance, according to Ford.
More Electric Vans
So, what’s new for 2025? Well, customers can now outfit the E-Transit with one of four ready-made, factory-installed trade packages made by third-party accessory supplier Ranger Design.
There’s a $4,370 Electrician pack with drawers and bins to store parts and reels to hand bundles of wires. The $4,440 HVAC trade package comes with large shelves and storage bins, as well as specialized refrigerant storage racks and restraints. The General Contractor pack meanwhile starts at $2,900 and includes a mix of multipurpose shelves, bins, drawers and hooks. And finally, there’s a $3,300 Folding Shelving Package with deep, large-capacity folding shelves designed for delivery services.
New options are also available, such as the Wall Liner Kit for regular or long-length body types, as well as the Large Grab Handles Kit for the two D-pillars for easier access in the back.
The Mobile Power Cord is optional but includes a fast charging adapter that can be used to top-up the E-Transit at Tesla Superchargers. Ford also made the Smart Acceleration Truncation option a standalone item for fleet customers. The feature limits the van’s acceleration by automatically calculating the payload for a smooth start every time, regardless of driver skill or load.
The 2025 E-Transit comes as standard with 180-degree opening 50/50 rear-hinged doors on all low- and medium-roof cargo vans and all passenger vans. All high-roof cargo vans get 253-degree opening doors as standard, but they can be specced as an option on all low- and medium-roof versions.
As with the outgoing model, the 2025 Ford Transit is powered by an 89-kilowatt-hour battery pack that sends juice to a single, rear-mounted electric motor that’s good for 266 horsepower and 317 pound-feet of torque. The low-roof models have an estimated range of 159 miles on  a full charge, while the medium roof lowers the estimate to 148 miles and the high roof to 143 miles.
The battery can be charged from an AC source at up to 19.2 kilowatts for a 0-to-100% top-up in six hours and 11 minutes (on an 80-amp circuit). The maximum DC fast charging rate is 176 kW, with the low-roof van gaining 67 miles of range in just 15 minutes from a compatible stall.",Iulian Dnistran
"The 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali Gets More Range, Cheaper Base Price",https://insideevs.com/news/737361/2025-gmc-sierra-ev-specs/,"That was fast. For 2025, GMC's electric truck gets more flexibility and some colors, too.",2024-10-14 14:57:32,"If it feels like the GMC Sierra EV just hit the market, that's because, well, it did. GMC's entry into the electric truck wars debuted this summer as a 2024 model. But the 2025 version is already on its way, and it brings some enticing upgrades over ""last year's"" Sierra EV—and a cheaper price of admission to boot.
GMC today announced that the 2025 Sierra EV Denali will offer a base version with 390 miles of range, and a Max Range variant with up to 460 miles of range. Both figures are General Motors' estimates and not ones from the EPA, but those are coming soon, and there's little reason to doubt that the Sierra EV will be a range monster.
After all, the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 that I tested in Detroit just two months ago was GMC-estimated to max out at 440 miles of range. Including destination fees, that truck came in at $99,495, including destination fees.
Now, the base GMC Sierra EV Denali starts at $91,995, while the Max Range version starts at $100,495 (both including $2,095 destination fees.) Compared to the 2024 Edition 1, that's a small price to pay for an extra 20 miles of range, while the base model is a far more compelling proposition.
Little else seems to have changed from 2024. It's still a 200+ kWh (estimated) lithium-ion Ultium battery pack with fast charging speeds up to 350kW, offering up to 100 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes. The truck's max towing is rated at 10,500 pounds.
With this move, GM's electric truck lineup is looking a lot more fleshed out. Just last week, GM announced the Chevy Silverado EV—a downmarket version of the fancier Sierra EV—will start at $57,095. That truck's Extended Range LT model with 408 miles of range starts at $75,195. All told, the Silverado EV is now a much more promising option than the RST First Edition I tested earlier this year, which was an eyebrow-raising $96,000.
The GMC take on this same truck is much quieter and convincingly more premium overall. While a ""base"" price of $91,995 means it's no bargain-basement work truck, I do feel like you get a lot for the price here, from range to Super Cruise-capable towing and beyond.
And in even more exciting news, the GMC Sierra EV now comes in different colors besides the pictured Thunderstorm Gray (which is still my favorite):
Finally, more Sierra EV variants are coming in 2025, including the Elevation and AT4 models, which will offer ""even greater choice and rugged off-road capability,"" GMC officials said in a news release.

This Is An Alpine SUV Because Nothing Is Sacred Anymore,https://www.motor1.com/news/736958/alpine-a390-concept-debut/,"Et tu, Alpine?",2024-12-25 09:02:30,"Ah, just what we needed. Yet another SUV. I've always thought of Alpine as being the French equivalent of Lotus since they've focused on lightweight sports cars. Much like the peeps from Norfolk now have an electric SUV with the Eletre, the boys and girls based in Dieppe are introducing this–the A390_β. It's only a concept at this stage but a production version will follow next year.
Just like Ferrari is refusing to call the Purosangue an SUV, Alpine doesn't use the acronym. Instead, it's a ""sport fastback."" The sloping roofline gives the impression of an SUV that had an affair with a coupe. Because this is only a concept, the Renault-owned marque can get away with not giving the A390_β a conventional B-pillar. However, that won't be the case with the subsequent road-going model. In addition, the suicide doors won't make it to production either.
Although the concept does look more exciting than your typical SUV, logic tells us the actual vehicle people will be able to buy won’t match this level of pizzazz. There is hope, though. Alpine does promise the final car will retain around 85% of the exterior design but we'll believe it when we'll see it.
The futuristic interior is said to take after Formula 1 cars but obviously with a lot more seats. The A390 is touted as a five-seater version of the future electric A110 sports car. It's the one Alpine initially planned to develop with Lotus before the two parted ways in mid-2023.
Technical specifications are limited at this point but we do know the production model will feature three electric motors. One will sit at the front and the other two at the back, enabling all-wheel drive. It won’t be a permanent AWD setup, which suggests the front-mounted motor can be decoupled for a more tail-happy experience. Active torque vectoring is promised for a more engaging drive.
The A390 will be the second EV from Alpine, following the A290 hot hatchback. The latter is essentially a high-performance version of the reborn Renault 5. Although Alpine is coming to the United States in a couple of years, you won’t see these electric vehicles in North America. Instead, bigger SUVs are expected to get a US visa. There are also plans for an A310 coupe, a bigger four-seat sports car to take on the Porsche 911 but with an electric setup.
By the end of the decade, Alpine intends to have no fewer than seven EVs in its growing lineup. A supercar was recently confirmed and it'll either be entirely electric or will feature a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine.

This Alpine Supercar Has A Hydrogen V-6 Engine,https://insideevs.com/news/737308/alpine-supercar-hydrogen/,The Alpenglow Hy6 concept uses a twin-turbo 3.5-liter engine that makes serious horsepower.,2024-10-14 09:40:07,"Much like Toyota, Alpine thinks the combustion engine can be saved by making it run on hydrogen. While the Japanese automaker has been experimenting with GR Yaris and GR Corolla hot hatches with three-cylinder engines, Renault's performance division started with a four-cylinder unit. Now, it’s displaying a supercar concept with an even bigger V-6.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is an evolution of the Alpenglow Hy4 we saw a few months ago. The previous car was a running prototype of the 2022 Alpenglow, a static concept. Gone is the turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine with 340 horsepower since it's made way for a 3.5-liter V-6 with a pair of turbos. It belts out 730 hp and 568 lb-ft (770 Nm) delivered to the rear axle.
Renault's performance arm says it engineered the six-cylinder engine to run on hydrogen and linked it to a sequential transmission. The V-6 revs to 9,000 rpm and feeds on hydrogen stored in three tanks. Two are mounted in the side pods while the third one sits behind the cockpit. All three tanks are placed in ventilated compartments, and for safety reasons, don't share anything with the cabin.
The Alpenglow Hy6 is motivated by a completely new V-6 that took two years to develop. It uses an aluminum block with a dry sump and produces 211 hp per liter. The mid-mounted combustion engine is nestled in an LMP3 carbon chassis and enables the supercar to exceed 205 mph (330 km/h) with zero emissions. There is an Inconel exhaust system built into the taillights but its role is to release water vapor.
Alpine has confirmed plans to put a supercar in production but it’s unclear whether it’ll have a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine or a fully electric drivetrain. In the meantime, the French brand is gearing up to make its debut in the United States in a couple of years.
Alpine is displaying the Alpenglow Hy6 at the 2024 Paris Motor Show together with the A290 electric hot hatch as a performance version of the new Renault 5. In addition, the A390 concept is also there ahead of next year when the production model will become the company's first SUV. In addition, the limited-run A110 R Ultime special edition is also in the City of Lights this week as the brand's most expensive car ever.

2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron Packs Over 400 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/737215/audi-q6-sportback-etron-specs-official/,"Mind you, that’s on the WLTP cycle, but it’s still very impressive. There’s also a new SQ6 performance trim.",2024-10-14 03:34:15,"This is the all-new 2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron. It’s the coupe-like version of the more conventionally shaped Q6 E-Tron that debuted roughly seven months ago. It rides on the same PPE platform as the Porsche Macan, can recharge at up to 270 kilowatts from a compatible DC stall and has over 400 miles of range on the WLTP cycle.
Two battery sizes and two powertrain options are available. The smaller pack has a usable capacity of 75.8 kilowatt-hours (83 kWh gross), while the larger battery can store 94.9 kWh (100 kWh gross) of energy.
With rear-wheel drive and the entry-level battery pack, the new Q6 Sportback E-Tron has a WLTP-rated range of up to 338 miles on a full charge. Meanwhile, a dual-motor all-wheel drive model with the large pack can drive for up to 407 miles before needing a top-up. We expect these figures to go down once the EPA gets involved, but the coupe-ish EV will likely remain the range king among electric Audis even after the American rating is official.
More Audi EVs
By comparison, the Tesla Model Y, which is roughly 30,000 euros cheaper, offers between 282 and 373 miles of range on the WLTP cycle.
The efficiency improvement is partly due to the lower sloping roofline of the Sportback compared to the regular Q6 SUV. According to Audi, the whole roof arch was redesigned and the car now sits 1.4 inches lower than its more conventionally shaped sibling. This helped reduce the drag coefficient from 0.28 to 0.26, but it also reduced the cargo space in the trunk, albeit not by much. The rakish EV has 18 cubic feet of room for stuff in the rear, while the SUV has 18.6 cu ft. Fold the rear seats flat and the trunk capacity increases to 48.4 cu ft. There’s also a 2.2 cu ft front trunk, just like the Q6 E-Tron SUV.
Audi didn’t say how powerful the base, rear-driven version of the Q6 Sportback E-Tron is, but mentioned that it can accelerate from zero to 62 miles per hour in 7 seconds with Launch Control enabled. Next in line is the Q6 Sportback E-Tron Performance, which is still rear-wheel drive. It has 301 horsepower and can sprint to 62 mph in 6.6 seconds.
Adding a front motor results in a system output of 382 hp for the all-wheel drive Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron Quattro. With Launch Control turned on, this version can get to 62 mph in 5.9 seconds.
Then, there’s the top-of-the-line SQ6, which has a dual-motor setup good for 482 hp and a 0-62 time of 4.3 seconds, while the range is rated at 377 miles. All versions are limited to 130 mph, except the SQ6 which can go up to 143 mph. All-wheel drive trims can tow up to 5,291 pounds, while rear-driven versions have a lower tow rating of 4,409 lbs in Europe.
When fitted with rear-wheel drive and the 75.8 kWh battery, the Q6 Sportback E-Tron can charge at up to 225 kW from a compatible DC stall, while RWD models with the 94.9 kWh can accept up to 260 kW.
Adding all-wheel drive ups the maximum charging rate to 270 kW, resulting in a 10-to-80% top-up in 22 minutes. Additionally, Audi claims the Q6 Sportback E-Tron Performance needs just 10 minutes at a fast charger to gain 165 miles of range.
Inside, the swoopy EV gets the same treatment as its SUV brother. This means there’s an 11.9-inch virtual cockpit display and a 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen running Android Automotive OS as standard. A third 10.9-inch passenger display is optional, as is an augmented-reality head-up display system
In Europe, the 2025 Audi Q6 Sportback E-Tron starts from 65,900 euros, while the top-spec SQ6 Sportback E-Tron starts at 96,200 euros. Production will be handled by Audi’s main factory in Ingolstadt, Germany, with order books slated to open at the turn of the year. Pricing and availability is yet to be determined for the North American market.",Iulian Dnistran
"Mini John Cooper Works Electric: It’s Official This Time, We Promise",https://insideevs.com/news/736986/mini-john-cooper-works-electric-debut-specs/,The first-ever battery-powered Mini JCW models are here. But you probably already knew that.,2024-10-14 02:10:00,"After what felt like an eternity filled with official pictures of camouflaged prototypes and preliminary technical specs, the cat is finally out of the bag–for real this time. This is the all-new Mini John Cooper Works Electric in all its glory. Though, seriously, Mini, you need to get your act together and stop teasing the hell out of your upcoming models and then expect people to act surprised when you drop the camo.
Aaaanyway. This is the real John Cooper Works, not the JCW trim you can get on the regular Mini hatchback, which is only a cosmetic pack. This means you get a healthy 258 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque from a front-mounted single electric motor. There’s also a boost function that offers an extra 27 hp at the push of a button for short bursts of acceleration.
The battery pack has a gross capacity of 54.2 kilowatt-hours and offers a combined WLTP-rated range of 230 miles. Under the more conservative EPA procedure, we expect the range rating to drop to around 200 miles on a full charge, but we’ll know for sure when Mini introduces the hot three-door hatchback in the United States.
More Mini
Going from zero to 62 miles per hour takes 5.9 seconds and the top speed is 124 miles per hour. The company didn’t say how fast the electric hot hatch can recharge, though. The Mini Cooper SE, which uses the same battery as the John Cooper Works, has a maximum DC charging rate of 95 kW, while the larger Countryman can accept up to 130 kW.
Mini said the new electric JCW hatchback has a specific suspension tune that maximizes the go-kart feeling Minis are known for, as well as ensuring agile handling.
Black side skirts, black C-pillar aero blades and a black rear spoiler are part of the standard kit, as well as JCW-specific 19-inch wheels. There's also a pretty aggressive front bumper. Inside, the go-fast electric Mini comes with a black and red pattern on the knitted surface of the dashboard, black faux-leather seats with multicolored knitted fabric and red accent stitching, as well as a high-resolution 9.4-inch round center touchscreen display that acts as both the infotainment screen and the digital instrument cluster.
The new Mini John Cooper Works Electric three-door hatchback will make its global debut at the Paris Motor Show this week, but we don’t know when–or if–it will make it to the United States. Next to it, Mini also showed the John Cooper Works Aceman, which is like a four-door crossover version of the hatchback. It has the same battery, power output and top speed as the three-dor hatchback, but the zero to 62 mph time is a little slower at 6.4 seconds and the WLTP range rating is also down to 220 miles on a full charge.",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Chevy Silverado EV Finally Starts At A Better Price: $57,095",https://insideevs.com/news/736426/chevy-silverado-ev-2025-range/,It also offers a truly staggering maximum range figure. But there's a catch to that lower price.,2024-10-07 12:06:25,"Chevrolet on Monday dropped details about the 2025 Silverado EV. The battery-powered version of General Motors' best-selling truck is getting a lower starting price and a new EPA range rating that puts it near the very top of the EV market.
The 2025 Silverado EV will start at $57,095, putting it within reach for a greater number of buyers. The new Max Range trim earns an EPA range estimate of 492 miles, beating out every other EV pickup truck on the market by a wide margin. Both the entry-level and range-topping trims are only available for commercial customers who buy various versions of the Silverado EV Work Truck, or WT.
“Truck customers tell us range is one of the main barriers to considering an EV. The 2024 Silverado EV already was the range leader, and for this new model year we’ve set the bar even higher,” Chevrolet Vice President Scott Bell said in a statement. “A second barrier to entry is price, so we are fortifying the Silverado EV lineup by providing more choice. For 2025, we’re introducing an LT trim, offering a more affordable RST package and expanding WT offerings. This increased capability and accessibility is great news for the segment, the industry, and the brand.”
Here's a full trim breakdown for the 2025 Silverado EV:
The new trims come during a pivotal time for GM's electric ambitions. After a rocky start of production and sales for its next-generation EVs—like the Chevy Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq—the automaker is rapidly gaining momentum. It appears to have put software glitches and battery-production bottlenecks behind it, and is now finally seeing success launching new electric models and scaling up their sales.
For 2024, the Silverado EV's inaugural model year, the truck was only available in two WT trims and the expensive, fully-loaded RST variant. Now, Chevy is filling in the gaps with some lower-priced options for both commercial and mainstream customers. With the new models, Chevy has a more well-rounded competitor to the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T.
Here are a few more details about the 2025 trims.
The all-new LT is priced so customers can qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, Chevy says. It supports 300-kilowatt fast charging, can tow 12,500 lb and has a payload capacity of 1,800 lb. Horsepower and torque are rated by GM at 645 and 765, respectively. Chevy's Multi-Flex Tailgate, which offers several different configurations, comes as standard equipment.
Upgrading to the Premium Package opens up options for Super Cruise—GM's wonderful hands-off highway-driving system—and the Multi-Flex Midgate. The latter lets you open up the divider between the cab and bed to haul longer items.
The 2025 Silverado EV WT now has a starting price that's essentially identical to Ford's electric work truck, the Lightning Pro. But the entry-level Silverado EV's range is still TBD.
Nearly 500 miles of range at the top end may sound like overkill—and that may in fact be the case for drivers who mostly go to the grocery store and back. But there's a good reason automakers like GM want to pack their pickup trucks with as much range as possible: Towing. The added weight and drag from towing something like a boat or a trailer can easily cut an EV's range in half. That makes the more typical 300 miles of estimated range a nonstarter for many truck lovers. Now, with a 500-mile pack, the Silverado EV should be able to tow for longer than ever before.

Caterham's Electric Sports Car Will Get Its Power From An Unlikely Source,https://www.motor1.com/news/735830/yamaha-power-caterham-sports-car/,The rear-wheel-drive electric coupe will fight the next Porsche Cayman.,2024-12-25 09:02:32,"Remember the Caterham Project V? The electric concept car debuted last year at the Goodwood Festival of Speed with an impressively low curb weight of 2,623 pounds. But it was more than just a one-and-done exercise; The niche British brand has real plans to launch a production model. And now we know who will power the electric coupe: Yamaha
The concept is now evolving into a prototype engineered by Japanese firm Tokyo R&D. It will be powered by a Yamaha electric powertrain, and should be completed by the middle of next year, with series production expected to commence at some point in 2026. Caterham doesn't go into details about Yamaha's electric motor, but the original Project V concept was rear-wheel drive with 268 horsepower on tap.
The show car from Goodwood had a 2+1 layout but an optional 2+2 configuration was mentioned. Caterham touted a 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and a top speed of 143 mph. The coupe's 55.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery had enough juice for 249 miles in the optimistic WLTP cycle. The concept supported DC charging at 150 kilowatts for a 20% to 80% charge in around 15 minutes.
Because concepts are typically diamonds in the rough, Caterham borrowed bits and pieces from other cars to speed up the Project V's development without compromising quality. Examples include Maserati seats and the Audi TT's door aperture. Some readily available parts will be installed in the road-going model to cut costs.
Even though it never built its own car, Yamaha is no stranger to the automotive industry. It teased us with a Miata rival in the mid-2010s that never went into production. Going further back, it helped Toyota develop the 2000GT in the 1960s before engineering and manufacturing Ford's V-6 SHO and V-8 SHO.
Perhaps the most well-known effort in the car world was Yamaha’s involvement in the Lexus LFA and its naturally aspirated V-10. The list goes on with a V-8 for Volvo as well as four-cylinder engines for the Toyota Celica, MR2, and the Lotus Elise. There was also the pint-sized Motiv concept and the aborted 1992 OX99-11 supercar that was supposed to go into production a couple of years later with a roaring V-12.
Yamaha hasn't completely abandoned ICE technology. Recent efforts have included a golf cart and a buggy modified to run on a hydrogen-burning combustion engine.

"The Chevy Blazer EV Gets Way Better For 2025: More Range, New Models",https://insideevs.com/news/735376/blazer-ev-2025-lineup/,"The long-awaited SS version goes on sale in Q1 2025, while other variants get improved range, horsepower and torque.",2024-09-27 11:12:03,"I'd say the Chevrolet Blazer EV has mounted a nice little comeback in 2024. It ended the previous year under a stop-sale order following software issues that InsideEVs was among the first to report on, only to see a big overhaul, sales wins and even a spot in our deputy editor's own personal garage. And today, General Motors officials say that things are due to get even better for the 2025 model year.
GM has announced pricing and availability of the 2025 Blazer EV family, including the deployment of a few long-promised variants with nice upgrades to range, pricing and horsepower for several others. Let's dig in.
We'll start with the fun news: The long-awaited Blazer EV SS is finally going on sale in Q1 of 2025. Pricing has been made official at $61,995, including destination. The performance Blazer EV will pack 595 horsepower—more than even the previously announced 557 hp—and can do zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds with the full-bore Wide Open Watts mode engaged. It should be a worthy competitor to the likes of the Kia EV6 GT, and I know someone will see how it squares up against the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N as well.
Next, GM says that 2025 brings all of the promised Blazer EV variants. Besides the SS, you can choose the all-wheel-drive, rear-wheel-drive and front-wheel-drive models too. The last one is all-new; the other two have been around for a bit. Offering all three drivetrain configurations makes the Blazer EV a pretty unique vehicle in the history of carmaking, but I'm curious how long the FWD version sticks around with the Equinox EV out there.
Additionally, the 2025 Blazer EV AWD has improved range, horsepower and torque from the 2024 model. The EPA-estimated range is now 283 miles, up from 279, and horsepower is bumped to 300 from 288. Torque is also boosted to 355 lb-ft from 333 lb-ft. It starts at $48,995.
The RWD version also gets a glow-up, going up to 334 miles of range from the 2024 model's 324 miles. Horsepower jumps to 365 hp versus the old car's 340 hp; torque stays the same. Pricing begins at $56,990.
The FWD Blazer EV remains a bit of an odd animal, but the pricing is respectable at $45,995. It gives you 220 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Range has not been finalized yet, according to GM.
The whole Blazer EV lineup fully qualifies for the $7,500 EV tax credits whether you buy or lease, so you are getting some solid bang for your buck here. And with these power and range bumps, I'd argue some needed distance between this car and the slightly smaller but still similarly priced Equinox EV.
Update: After getting a few questions about this, GM tells us that Super Cruise is optional on FWD and AWD LT and RS models but standard on the SS. It is not available on RWD models, but GM hasn't responded to additional questions as to why.
Is the Blazer EV a better deal than ever? Let us know what you think.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Gets Even Driftier,https://www.motor1.com/news/734891/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n/,A configurable Drift Mode and a handful of other upgrades join the lineup for 2025.,2024-12-25 09:02:33,"It’s been a little over a year since Hyundai took the wraps off the Ioniq 5 N. The high-performance electric crossover is entering the 2025 model year at home in South Korea with a surprisingly large number of changes. There aren't any styling tweaks since most of the work revolved around making the software better to deliver a more engaging drive.
The N Drift Optimizer that helps the Ioniq 5 N go sideways can now be configured by choosing from one of the 10 available levels of assistance. Dial it all the way up to level 10 (Pro mode) and the hot EV becomes tail-happy by minimizing the intervention of the stability control system so that drivers can ""drift more freely."" In addition, the system can now better detect suitable drift conditions, which Hyundai presumes will be only on a race track.
There's also something called Downshift Memory. Intended for track use, the function ""allows the vehicle to store commands without shifting and shift when the vehicle reaches the allowable engine revs (rpm) for downshifting."" We’ll remind you the old Kona N had a downshift memory logic system that prevented downshifting at high rpms.
Elsewhere, the artificial engine sound is automatically turned on when the launch control function is triggered. This N Active Sound+ simulates the noise of a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine as found in the Elantra N.
The 2025 Ioniq 5 N for Korea gets automatic high beams with glare-free functionality. There's also a Walk-Away Lock system that automatically locks the doors when the driver walks a certain distance away from the car. The model year change brings Vehicle to Load (V2L) so that you can use the battery's stored energy to power external devices.
Rounding off the list of novelties are the second-row safety windows and haptic warning for the steering wheel. The latter begins to vibrate to warn the driver whenever the assist systems detect a hazard.
In Korea, the 2025 Ioniq 5 N costs the equivalent of $57,600 after factoring in incentives. Meanwhile, Hyundai is putting the finishing touches on its sedan equivalent, the Ioniq 6 N.

Kia EVs Will Get Tesla Supercharger Access Early Next Year,https://insideevs.com/news/734928/kia-ev-tesla-supercharger-2025-adapter/,Some Kia EV6 and EV9 buyers will get a free adapter. Others will have to pay for it.,2024-09-24 07:53:45,"Kia electric vehicles sold in the United States will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network on January 15, 2025, the company said in a statement released today. The South Korean automaker will follow in the footsteps of Ford, Rivian and General Motors by striking a deal with Tesla to use its expansive DC fast-charging network that has over 16,500 stalls in the U.S.
Customers who took delivery of a new 2024 or 2025 Kia EV9 or 2024 Kia EV6 from September 6 will get a free adapter that will allow them to use the Supercharger network. Deliveries for the complimentary adapter are slated to start in early 2025.
However, people who bought an EV6, EV9 or Niro EV before the aforementioned date will have to pay for an adapter, although Kia didn’t say how much it would cost. For reference, the Tesla-made NACS to CCS1 adapter sold by General Motors costs $225, while third-party adapters are slightly less expensive.
More Stuff Like This
Kia will offer three adapters: one that allows current Kia EVs to fast-charge on Tesla Superchargers, one that allows future Kia EVs equipped from the factory with the Tesla plug to charge at CCS1 stalls like those offered by Electrify America and EVgo, and one that allows NACS-equipped Kia EVs to AC-charge on non-Tesla Level 2 chargers. In other words, there will be NACS to CCS1, CCS1 to NACS and J1772 to NACS adapters available from Kia starting next year.
As a reminder, current Kia electric vehicles come from the factory with the Combined Charging System 1 (CCS1) plug, while Tesla’s Supercharger network uses the so-called North American Charging Standard (NACS), except for the few stalls that are equipped with a built-in adapter known as the Magic Dock.
The refreshed EV6 is slated to become the first Kia EV sold in the U.S. with a native NACS charging port. The European-spec 2025 EV6 shown here has a CCS2 port.
If you’re wondering why Kia mentions NACS-equipped EVs, it’s because it will start making them pretty soon. As with the recently revealed 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 that comes with a NACS plug, the upcoming Kia EV6 will ditch the CCS1 connector in favor of the more compact plug designed by Tesla, at least in North America. Other models, like the EV9 will follow suit.

""The all-new Ford Ranger PHEV is only available for select global markets outside of North America. For customers in North America looking for a hybrid or electric truck, we currently offer Maverick Hybrid, F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid and F-150 Lightning.""
Ford is putting its money where its mouth is. After canceling an upcoming all-electric three-row SUV and pledging to bring more hybrid and plug-in hybrid models to the market, the American automaker has revealed the Ranger PHEV mid-size pickup in Germany today.
Bigger than the American-spec Maverick hybrid compact pickup, the Ranger with a plug is powered by a 2.3-liter gasoline engine that sends power to all four wheels through a 10-speed modular automatic transmission and a two-speed transfer case. There’s also a lockable rear differential on offer for those tricky trips off the beaten track.
That 10-speed auto houses a 75-kilowatt (100-horsepower) electric motor that can work either on its own or together with the combustion engine to provide a total system output of 279 hp and 509 pound-feet of torque–more than the Ranger Raptor’s standard 430 lb-ft. And because the e-motor is inside the transmission, drivers can use four-wheel drive even when the 2.3-liter lump under the hood is turned off. There’s also regenerative braking.
More Electrified Pickups
Power for the electric motor comes from an 11.8-kWh (usable) battery pack that’s nestled between specially engineered frame rails. The battery offers a WLTP range of over 28 miles and charging it from empty to full takes less than four hours, according to Ford, although the automaker didn’t mention how potent the on-board charger is.
Four EV-related driving modes are available, including Auto EV, EV Now, EV Later and EV Charge. Similar to the hybrid and all-electric F-150, the Ranger PHEV comes as standard with a 2.3 kW electrical outlet in the bed which can be used to power tools or appliances, but Ford also offers an upgraded package with two 15-amp outlets in the back delivering a combined maximum power of 6.9 kW–3.45 kW for each outlet.
With revised suspension compared to its conventionally powered sibling, the plug-in Ranger can carry a payload of up to 2,205 lbs and can tow up to 7,716 lbs. The smaller Maverick can only tow up to 4,000 lbs, while the maximum payload is 1,500 lbs, so the Ranger PHEV makes a lot more sense if you’re looking for a more capable machine that can also run on electricity alone.
The new Ford Ranger PHEV will be available in Europe starting in the spring of 2025 in Wildtrak and XLT trim levels. A PHEV-exclusive Stormtrak launch edition is also in the works with all sorts of goodies as standard, including 18-inch wheels, fender vents, matrix LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system and a 10-speaker B&O sound system.
The Europe-bound plug-in Ranger will be built in Silverton, South Africa.",Iulian Dnistran
2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV: You Can Order One Now,https://insideevs.com/news/734185/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-orders/,The first electric muscle car is coming soon. Dodge opened up orders and launched a new online configurator.,2024-09-17 16:10:59,"If you've been waiting for an electric vehicle that looks—and, importantly, sounds—like a good ol' American muscle car, then you're in luck. Dodge on Monday opened up orders for the 2024 Charger Daytona, which is the brand's debut EV and the world's first electric muscle car.
Well, it's the first muscle EV you can buy brand-new from the manufacturer; people have been retrofitting electric motors into vintage Ford Mustangs and the like for years.
Dodge launched a new online configurator on Monday that lets you spec your Charger Daytona to your liking. It even lets customers open the rear hatch, inspect the frunk, open the doors and see what the interior looks like with the rear seats folded down, which is all pretty neat. However, customers will need to contact a Dodge dealer to place a custom order or buy a preconfigured Charger.
The 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona online configurator
The Charger Daytona will eventually come in both two-door and four-door options and with the option of an electric or (eventually) a gasoline powertrain. It debuts in two-door EV guise with the sedan and inline-six engine coming later. Early customers can choose from two models: the Charger R/T and the Charger Scat Pack.
The R/T costs $61,590 (including a destination fee, but excluding options and dealer markups) and delivers a Dodge-estimated 496 horsepower. The Scat Pack will run you $75,185 (same caveats apply) and boasts a whopping 670 horsepower. That one should hit 60 mph from a standstill in 3.3 seconds, Dodge says. The R/T is EPA-rated for a respectable 317 miles of range, while the Scat Pack serves up 260 miles.
The cars also come with Dodge's ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" a feature that blasts synthetic rumbles to the outside world. Dodge wants its first EV to appeal to its existing customers—a macho crowd with a need for speed it calls ""The Brotherhood of Muscle""—so it's making sure the Charger Daytona is as loud, powerful and over the top as its gas-fueled models. We'll have to see whether Dodge can win over the V8-loving EV skeptics.
To that end, Dodge is lavishing perks on the Charger EV's earliest customers. People who place a custom order before November will get a two-day performance-driving course, a ""VIP concierge"" to answer their questions and a pair of leather, Dodge-branded driving gloves. All 2024 Charger Daytona buyers will be able to choose between $600 in public-charging credits and an at-home Level 2 charger.
Would that entice you to take the plunge into a Charger Daytona? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Volvo’s Car Subscription Program Is Dead,https://insideevs.com/news/733597/volvo-car-subscription-over/,"Care by Volvo brought in new customers for the automaker, but now it’s all about “operational efficiencies.”",2024-09-13 02:34:01,"Volvo has suspended its subscription program in the United States and Europe “for the foreseeable future,” the company told Automotive News yesterday. Dubbed Care by Volvo, the vehicle subscription service ended on August 1, but people who are still enrolled can finish their term and then become eligible for a $1,000 credit toward a new Volvo purchase or $500 toward a lease.
""This allows for concentrated focus on our core customer offers and the coming introduction of new products, [and an] increase in operational efficiencies,"" company spokesperson Russell Datz said. In other words, it’s all about cost-cutting.
Care by Volvo was first rolled out in 2017, but some dealers heavily criticized it and then a six-month investigation by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles concluded that the Swedish automaker had failed to properly notify dealers about related changes to the franchise agreement and provided preferential treatment in allocating subscription vehicles to certain stores.
More Volvo Stuff
So Volvo started over in 2019, and by 2020, the program was profitable, according to Automotive News. The idea behind the vehicle subscription service was to provide more flexibility than a conventional lease at slightly lower monthly prices. After the latest update to the program terms, customers could choose a car that was in stock and then swap it for another one or terminate the contract altogether after five months without penalty.
The monthly fee included the car, insurance, roadside assistance and other perks, essentially making the ownership experience hassle-free. Prices started at around $600 for a combustion-powered Volvo XC40 and only went uphill from there.
The program helped Volvo reel in people who wouldn’t have otherwise considered a car from the Swedish brand, with 80% of customers new to the marque, according to data from previous years. Dealers got a cut of the subscription revenue and could then list lower-mileage, higher-margin certified models for sale after the terms ended.
The automaker didn’t disclose how many people signed up for Care by Volvo.",Iulian Dnistran
Stellantis Invests $406M In U.S. Plants To Build BEVs Alongside ICE Models,https://www.motor1.com/news/733390/stellantis-investment-factories-bev/,"The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will be its first US factory to build a fully electric vehicle, the Ram 1500 REV.",2024-12-25 09:02:37,"On Wednesday, Stellantis announced it is investing $406 million into three Michigan factories. The money will go toward preparing the facilities to produce battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and their associated components, and the automaker plans to build BEVs alongside their combustion-powered counterparts as it navigates a changing automotive industry and faces questions about its future in the United States.
The automaker’s Sterling Heights Assembly Plant is getting the bulk of the investment—$235.5 million—which will allow the facility to produce the electric Ram 1500 Rev and the range-extended 1500 Ramcharger. It’ll be the company’s first US plant to build a fully electric vehicle. (The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona will be built in Brampton, Ontario, just outside Toronto.) The company has installed a new conveyor system, new automation processes for BEVs, and retooling to allow it to build gas- and battery-powered pickups on the same line.
Nearly $100 million will go to preparing the Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce the electric Jeep Wagoneer. Stellantis will have the ability to assemble the electric vehicle on the same line as the combustion-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models, which should allow it to tweak production to better build the types of vehicles customers want.
Flexibility is something that Dodge CEO Matt McAlear talked about last month regarding the new Charger Daytona, which rides in the STLA Large platform that Stellantis is investing in. The Dodge will spawn BEV and combustion-powered models.
The smallest investment, $73 million, will go to improve the automaker’s Dundee Engine Plant. The money will help retool the factory to build battery trays for the STLA Frame platform later this year and front and rear beams for the STLA Large architecture in 2026. Stellantis will build those components alongside two new combustion engines, including a new 1.6-liter inline-four that the company could use for future hybrid-electric vehicles.
The future is unclear, especially for automakers. People must make vital decisions years before a product goes on sale. Stellantis has 14 brands under its control after the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles merged in 2021, and the company’s plan to give every one of them a decade to prove their worth remains in place even as sales decline and the lineup thins in the US. But it takes time to chart a new course, and we will see new products from Stellantis soon.

It's Official: Nissan Is Working on a New Silvia Sports Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/732599/new-nissan-silvia-development-starts/,"Work has started on a third sports car, but a production version has still yet to be approved.",2024-12-25 09:02:38,"It’s been over a decade since Nissan introduced the retro-flavored IDx concept, hinting at a third sports car alongside the 370Z and GT-R. The former 370Z was replaced by the new Z, and the GT-R is dead—at least for the time being. The IDx, meanwhile, would've been too costly to produce and there wasn't enough demand. Nissan was also concerned it would've cannibalized sales of the 370Z.
However, Nissan has been dropping hints lately about launching a third performance model. The company has gone on record several times about resurrecting the beloved Silvia nameplate. But now it's official: The Silvia is coming back.
In a new interview with Australia's Drive magazine, a high-ranked official confirmed the sports car is officially in the works. Nissan Vice-President Global Product Strategy Ivan Espinosa shared the good news: ""We've been doing some very early upstream exercises of what the architecture could look like.""
An ""upstream exercise"" is a business process that basically refers to initial planning and the early stages of development. Espinosa aims for Nissan to have the sports car ready before the end of the decade with an electrified powertrain. That may be bad news for purists but a gas-only setup wouldn't work globally, especially in Europe where there are stringent emissions regulations that keep getting stricter.
Nissan wants the reborn Silvia to comply with regulations in as many countries as possible so it can ramp up production to achieve economies of scale. Even though sports cars are a niche market and developing one from scratch is a costly endeavor, Nissan won't join forces with another automaker to make it happen. Rather than going down the Z4/Supra, GR86/BRZ, or Miata/124 Spider route, the new Silvia will be an all-Nissan effort.
Espinosa is confident the company can ride solo in the engineering process but admits the project necessitates ""a serious level of investment,"" which is a ""difficult"" commitment to make. A new Silvia would be developed from the ground up, and his wish is for Nissan to skip a collaboration with another brand.
""I'm trying, as I said and I keep saying it in my brain, three sports cars in my lineup, a GT-R, a Z, and something else. And this something else in my brain is called the Silvia. Now, will we do it? I'm trying. I'm not sure we're going do it, just to be 100% clear, but It's something that I would like to do if we, if we can. I'm trying to make it work, I'm trying to make it happen. It's not an easy case. it's not easy because the sports cars market is shrinking.""
The fact of the matter is sports cars don't sell all that well. Nissan took its sweet time replacing the 370Z with a Z, and that's not even an all-new vehicle. It's understandable why the company is reluctant to pour a lot of money in what would ultimately be a niche product when it already has one (Z) and is working on another (GT-R). The mighty Godzilla going on a multi-year hiatus goes to show why Nissan is not rushing to replace the R35 anytime soon.
Launching a third sports car adds another level of complexity during challenging times for Nissan given the need to electrify its lineup. We can only hope that it makes the cut considering the Silvia's cult following and the scarcity of affordable sports cars. Honda's reborn Prelude gives us hope this segment of the market can survive in an SUV-hungry world.

BMW Will Launch A Hydrogen Car In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/732646/2028-bmw-hydrogen-car-confirmed/,It's teaming up with Toyota to make it happen.,2024-12-25 09:02:47,"A new player is about to enter the hydrogen game as BMW has confirmed plans to roll out a fuel cell electric vehicle in 2028. To bring the project to fruition, it's expanding its existing collaboration with Toyota, one of the few other automakers that still believes hydrogen has a future. While the Japanese brand has been selling the Mirai for a decade, this will be BMW's first hydrogen car people will actually be able to buy.
Since the vehicle won't be launching for another four years, BMW refrains from going into details. However, it does say the hydrogen model will be a version of an existing product. Munich’s latest hydrogen project is based on the X5. That being said, logic tells us a hydrogen SUV would not be a production version of the iX5 pictured here. This generation of the luxobarge is already in the second half of its life cycle. By 2028, it will have been replaced by the next-gen vehicle.
Whichever shape it'll take, BMW pledges to sell an original product that'll stay true to the brand instead of being a reskinned Toyota. Naturally, the latter is working on its own cars that will utilize the hydrogen fuel cell tech it's developing with its Bavarian partner. In the meantime, it's worth noting the fuel cells that go into the iX5 Hydrogen are supplied by Toyota.
The zero-emission SUV is part of a test fleet of fewer than 100 units built in Spartanburg and modified at a pilot plant in Munich. It's where the 396-horsepower iX5 gets its pair of 700-bar hydrogen tanks made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The two hold six kilograms of hydrogen for a WLTP range of 313 miles. It takes three to four minutes to refuel the vehicle, so about the same as a gas or diesel X5.
Provided BMW's first hydrogen car will be based on the next-generation X5, it'll be underpinned by the same CLAR platform as the gas/diesel/plug-in hybrid versions. There are reports that BMW might also launch a conventional EV with batteries on the same architecture as the rest of the X5 flavors. The next X5 is supposedly going into production in the latter half of 2026 and should include BEV versions from day one.
Arriving next year, Neue Klasse will be BMW’s first dedicated electric architecture and is being developed with a hydrogen fuel cell setup in mind. However, reports indicate that CLAR will be used instead, at least for the initial hydrogen efforts.
This might come as a surprise, but BMW has been actively involved in the development of hydrogen cars since 1979. It all started with the 520h featuring a combustion engine modified to run on hydrogen, a formula that was repeated later with the V-12-powered E38 and E65 sedans during the 2000s. That said, work on hydrogen ICEs was abandoned many years ago as the engineers preferred to focus on fuel cells after realizing they're more efficient.
Speaking with GoAuto earlier this year, Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group, said:
""Basically, with the X5 Hydrogen FCEV we get around 500 km [310 miles] from a fill. If I put a combustion engine in the same car with the same tank, I wouldn't even get 300 km [186 miles]. That is the difference between a product we can sell, and a product we cannot sell. At the 500-km [310-mile] mark, and with a refueling time of three to four minutes, I think people will consider making the move to hydrogen – so, it is relevant.""
There is a major problem we'd like to highlight. Yes, the refueling infrastructure. It’s basically nonexistent in many parts of the world, so we won’t be surprised if the vehicle will only be sold in select regions where owners can juice up their hydrogen cars. 2028 is four years away and the network might improve by then. BMW and Toyota do say they’re ""seeking regional or local projects to further drive the development of hydrogen infrastructure through collaborative initiatives.""

The Renault R17 Electric Restomod Is A Gorgeous Reinterpretation Of A 1970s Classic,https://insideevs.com/news/732636/renault-r17-electric-restomod/,"It’s wider, more powerful and has a tastefully recreated digital dash. Oh, and it’s also electric.",2024-09-05 04:26:14,"French carmaker Renault has transformed the 1970s two-door coupe known as the 17 into a modern, battery-powered restomod sporting retro looks, a brown paint job and a clever integration of screens where the traditional gauge cluster used to be.
It’s called the R17 electric restomod and it was created in collaboration with avant-garde French designer Ora Ito as the latest in a series of partnerships between the automaker and contemporary artists to put a modern touch on some of its most recognizable models.
Compared to the original Renault 17 that was sold in the United States on and off until its demise in 1979, the electric restomod is about seven inches wider, has slightly more flared wheel arches and the front and rear lights are LEDs mimicking the design of the first iteration of the 17 which had double round headlights.
More Beautiful EVs
The wheels are wider and taller than before and there’s a slight nod to the original car’s C-pillar louvers.
“I wanted to drape the Renault 17 in a second skin, showcasing the design while giving it a more contemporary look in terms of flow, dynamics and rationality through my own approach to design and my own signature: simplexity,” Ito said. “I wanted to simplify the more complex aspects.”
Under the hood of the old coupe was a 1.6-liter gasoline engine that drove the front wheels. The restomod ditched the entire setup for an all-electric approach with a rear-mounted motor that’s good for 270 horsepower. Renault didn’t say how big the battery is, but the range is estimated to be 249 miles on a full charge.
Inside, there are four individual displays sitting behind the square-ish two-spoke steering wheel mimicking the analog layout of the original car. There’s also a central infotainment screen located on the center console, just below the dash, where the clock used to sit.
It’s a wonderful design that’s very similar to the supposedly production-intent Hyundai N Vision 74 hydrogen car. But while Hyundai has voiced its intention to put the retro-looking coupe into production, the Renault R17 electric restomod will remain a one-off affair.",Iulian Dnistran
"Volvo Admits Defeat, Won't Go Fully Electric by 2030",https://www.motor1.com/news/732504/volvo-backtracks-ev-goal-2030/,New target: plug-in hybrids and EVs should account for 90-100% of sales.,2024-12-25 09:02:48,"Volvo was one of the first automakers to promise an electric-only lineup. If you recall, the original announcement was made in March 2021. At the end of May 2024, Volvo's CEO said an EV-only portfolio is still ""very achievable."" At that point, Jim Rowan was ""confident"" Volvo could end sales of vehicles with combustion engines in just five years.
However, during the most recent quarterly investor webcast held in late July, the automaker's CEO admitted that it'll ""take time to bridge different parts of the world for full electrification."" In other words, the initial goal to become a pure EV brand by 2030 might not be achieved. Fast forward to early September, Volvo is now officially readjusting its lofty electric goals.
The new target is for plug-in hybrids and electric cars to account for 90-100% of annual sales by the end of the decade. Volvo concedes cars without charging ports are likely to stick around longer than initially estimated, but only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models.""
The Swedish marque believes several factors have contributed to the slower-than-projected adoption of EVs. The development of the charging infrastructure is progressing at a slower pace. In addition, some countries have either reduced or completely eliminated incentives for EVs. Volvo also blames newly applied tariffs on electric cars in certain markets.
Volvo hopes cars with a charging cord (PHEVs+EVs) will account for 50-60% of deliveries by 2025, up from 48% during the second quarter of this year. From April through June, fully electric cars accounted for 26% of total shipments. The company's plan is to continue investments in mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid models as part of its ""strategic adjustments"" to better reflect what people want.
In the long run, Volvo still wants to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Volvo is the latest in a long string of automakers to backtrack from its original electric goals. In recent months, we've seen the likes of Porsche, Mercedes, Bentley, and Ford of Europe push back their aggressive electric agendas.

"2025 Volvo XC90 PHEV Has Sharper Looks, New Tech",https://insideevs.com/news/732476/2025-volvo-xc90-phev-looks-sharper-new-tech/,"Despite having a range of new models in the pipeline, Volvo still relies heavily on the XC90 to drive sales.",2024-09-04 09:15:00,"Volvo is doing pretty well globally. In the first seven months of 2024, its sales worldwide were up 13% compared to the same period last year. The surge is driven by its electrified lineup, whose sales are up 30%.
However, in the U.S., Volvo’s momentum has stalled. The EX30 is delayed until 2025 and the EX90 that InsideEVs recently reviewed isn’t fully polished. That means the brand must rely on its best-selling car stateside, the XC90 SUV, to do the heavy lifting before its next-generation models are fully ready to roll.
The Swedish automaker is calling the updated XC90 a ""2025.5"" model year car, which basically means it has some overlap with the current model on sale, but also offers some new stuff.
The obvious visual distinction is the updated exterior, which is more chiseled and cohesive than before. The grille is smoothly integrated with the body and new headlamps and taillamps look sleek. Inside, it gets a new central display with upgraded user interface and under the skin there are some improvements to the chassis.
To recap, the powertrains remain the same. It will be offered with the all-wheel-drive B5 and B6 trims powered by mild hybrid four-cylinder engines. The T8 plug-in hybrid will continue to get the four-cylinder turbocharged engine paired to a rear-axle mounted electric motor.
The e-motor draws power from the same 18.8 kilowatt-hour (14.7 kWh usable) battery pack that delivers an EPA estimated 32 miles of range on a single charge. Combined output is a rather healthy 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque.
On the exterior, the air intake, front bumper, hood and front fenders are all subtly redesigned to make the XC90 look more in line with the all-electric EX90. Gone are the old headlamps and in come a new set of T-shaped Matrix LED lamps. The taillamps also have a new LED signature. Volvo will offer new 20-, 21- and 22-inch wheels.
Volvos already get a built-in Google system but now there’s an upgraded layout meant to be more user-friendly. Volvo said the most common apps on the central screen will now appear on the home page, on what it calls a “contextual bar.” That means fewer taps to open what you want. It’s all similar to what you get on the brand new EX90.
Gone is the old dashboard integrated screen and in comes a new and larger 11.2 inch free standing central display. For the tech nerds: pixel density is up by 21%, meaning it's crisper than before. But even if your older Volvo doesn’t have this new and fancy screen, you will still get the upgraded user interface through an over-the-air update if your car was manufactured in 2020 or later.
There are also some other small tweaks, like improved sound insulation and more storage spaces inside. There’s an additional cup holder and the wireless charging pad is now positioned behind the central tunnel. Volvo said it made these changes based on owner feedback.
On the chassis side of things, the XC90 now gets Frequency Selective Damping. When you’re driving at slower speeds, these dampers basically make the suspension softer, making the ride smoother over bumps and undulations. But when you give it the beans, the dampers mechanically stiffen up for better control and stability.
It will go on sale later this year in the U.S. in six and seven seat configurations at a starting price of $58,450, plus destination fee of $1,295. That’s roughly $2,000 more than the starting price of the current model. Customer deliveries start in the first quarter of 2025.
In a roundtable with reporters at Volvo's headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden, CEO Jim Rowan said the company had to ""pivot"" because of the withdrawal of subsidies in certain markets and the new tariffs imposed by the U.S. and Europe on cars made in China. But despite that Volvo is still committed to electrification, even if that's now delayed.
""I still believe in electrification. I'm an engineer. Electrification is a much better propulsion system than petrol,"" he said. ""Internal combustion engines are probably 35% efficient, electric systems are 91-92% when it comes to efficiency. So at the end of the day technology will win. Electric is the technology of the future but it will just take a little bit longer than everybody first thought.""
If you want the latest and greatest Volvo, the fully-electric EX90 might be something to consider. But as InsideEVs found during the first drive review recently, that EV isn’t fully cooked yet, especially in the software department. CarPlay doesn’t work yet and Volvo’s new-gen driver assistance features are still under development.
We haven't tested the updated XC90 on the road yet, but once we do, we’ll share our thoughts. For now, if you're after a large, family-friendly, electrified Volvo, the XC90 might still be your best bet.

Smart Grows Up With New Midsize Electric Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/731675/smart-midsize-electric-crossover-unveiled/,"At 185 inches long, the Smart #5 has a very similar footprint to a Tesla Model Y.",2024-08-28 16:00:54,"Smart is distancing itself even further from its roots with the unveiling of the #5 electric crossover, the biggest model to ever wear a Smart badge. It is the third new smart to be unveiled after the #1 and #3, and purely based on its size alone, it has its sights set on the Tesla Model Y.
Measuring exactly 185 inches in total length, it has an almost identical footprint to Tesla’s global best-seller. It’s entering a segment populated by other talented electric crossovers from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Ford and others, so it needs to be special to stand out and win buyers.
We already had a pretty good idea of what the #5 was going to look like after Smart unveiled the #5 Concept, which had the production #5 body but with raised suspension and a general off-road makeover. It looks quite upright from most angles, with a more traditional SUV profile not too dissimilar from that of the slightly smaller Mercedes-Benz EQB.
It’s being pitched as an electric family crossover for outdoor enthusiasts, and it has an available Adventurers’ Collection pack that adds a roof light bar, underbody protection, a roof carrier, side steps and a ladder on the side. With this pack selected, it really does look ready to take you off the beaten path, even though it doesn’t have any extra ground clearance or mechanical changes to enhance its off-road ability.
Smart wants to highlight the #5’s interior, which is not only roomy but also packed with tech. It has 34 storage compartments in total, including a 2.5 cubic-foot front trunk and up to 54 cubic feet of space inside the vehicle if you fold the rear seats. What steals the show inside the vehicle is the huge 25.6-inch augmented reality head-up display, which complements a 10.3-inch digital gauge cluster and two high-resolution 13-inch AMOLED displays, one of which is in front of the passenger.
The infotainment animations are built using Unreal Engine, so for everything to run smoothly on all those screens, it needs a lot of processing power. That comes courtesy of an AMD V2000 eight-core integrated CPU and GPU designed for both mini PCs and automotive use.
Thanks to its 800-volt platform, the Smart #5 can quickly charge its 100-kilowatt-hour battery from 10 to 80% in 15 minutes. This gives an impressive range of 460 miles, but that’s on the optimistic Chinese CLTC test cycle. Its real-world range will probably be closer to 300-320 miles.
CarNewsChina reports that while the powertrain details are still unknown, the base versions will feature a single motor driving the rear wheels, producing 335 or 358 horsepower, and a dual-motor all-wheel drive version with 579 horsepower. The top model will have Brabus badges and increase the combined output of the dual-motor setup to 638 hp.
All #5s will be built in China, and they will go on sale there first, but Smart plans to begin sales in Europe in 2025. However, with looming increased import duties imposed on cars manufactured in China, the #5 may end up being quite expensive, and European buyers may want to stick to more keenly priced locally manufactured vehicles.

Hyundai Ioniq 9 Three-Row SUV To Be Built In America; 560-Mile 'EREV' In 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/731616/hyundai-investor-day-ioniq-9/,"At Hyundai's CEO Investor Day event, big plans to speed up on EVs—and a ""bridge"" vehicle that drives like an EV but packs a gas engine too.",2024-08-28 08:22:13,"Yet again, as other automakers begin to slow down on electric vehicles, Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is stepping on the accelerator. At the automaker's annual CEO Investor Day event in Seoul, senior leaders announced their strategy over the next few years, keeping a goal to sell 2 million EVs per year globally by 2030 but adding more hybrids into the mix—including a long-rumored new type of vehicle that may serve as the ultimate ""bridge"" between internal combustion and electric power.
Hyundai Motor President and CEO Jae Hoon Chang also announced big plans for the U.S. market, and for U.S. jobs: the upcoming new Hyundai Ioniq 9 electric three-row SUV will be built at the new Metaplant in Georgia, joining the familiar Ioniq 5 expected to start production there later this year.
In doing so, Chang also reaffirmed the name of the new SUV, which was previously called the Hyundai Ioniq 7. Unveiled as the Hyundai Seven Concept in 2021, the production version is expected to be seen at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this year.
""Hyundai Motor is making significant strides in its quest to become a global top-tier player in the EV market,"" Chang said in prepared remarks. ""As the only global automaker with a full battery system lineup, Hyundai Motor is dedicated not only to improving battery performance but also to ensuring that EVs are affordable, safe and easy to maintain.""
Georgia production of the Ioniq 9 had been expected, especially given the success of the similar Kia EV9 three-row crossover in America—which is also now built in the U.S. The Metaplant factory in Bryan County near Savannah is due to produce up to 300,000 vehicles per year while bringing thousands of jobs to the area, company officials have said. Building the Ioniq 9 here should qualify the car for U.S. EV tax credits of some sort.
In addition, with Ford now pivoting to a hybrid setup for its previously all-electric three-row SUV, Hyundai and Kia may get an even bigger lock on the mainstream three-row EV segment—for now, at least.
But even as it kept in place that aggressive global EV sales target, Hyundai officials admitted that the path to an electric future has been slower and less even than expected. As such, Chang confirmed that the automaker will step into EREVs—short for ""Extended Range Electric Vehicle.""
A modern take on the concept pioneered by the BMW i3 and Chevrolet Volt, an EREV is essentially a battery-powered EV that also packs a gas engine, but only as a generator to recharge that battery pack. The gas engine does not drive the wheels.
""The new EREV will combine the advantages of internal combustion engines and EVs,"" Chang said. ""Hyundai Motor has developed a unique new powertrain and power electronics system to enable four-wheel drive with the application of two motors. The operation is powered solely by electricity, similar to EVs, with the engine being used only for battery charging.""
In addition, that EREV model will be built in North America (the automaker did not disclose exactly where) and China in 2026, Chang said. They will debut as SUVs from Hyundai and the Genesis luxury brand with a target of 80,000 units per year on this continent. At least some models will offer ""refueling and stress-free charging"" with a range of over 900 km, or 560 miles, when fully charged.
""It provides EREV customers with a responsive EV-like driving experience, allowing consumers to naturally transition to EVs during future demand recovery periods,"" Chang said. From 2030 onward, ""Hyundai Motor aims to build a full lineup of EVs, from affordable EVs to luxury and high-performance models, and launch 21 models by 2030 to provide consumers with various options."" China will get more subcompact EREV models too, he added.
Earlier reports indicated that the next Hyundai Santa Fe and future trucks could get an EREV setup, but that was not confirmed on today's call.
Hyundai isn't the only automaker getting into the EREV game. Stellantis is as well, with the highly anticipated Ram Ramcharger truck that rides on a battery EV platform but also uses a V6 engine only for recharging. Mercedes-Benz is rumored to offer the same setup as an option on the upcoming CLA-Class too. By building cars on an EV platform but adding a gas engine only for charging, automakers can prepare their R&D and manufacturing for the future while the EV charging networks get built out—all with the ostensible goal of going all-electric someday. At least, that's the idea, anyway.
In the meantime, Hyundai also announced a major expansion of its hybrid offerings. The automaker has seen considerable success in the U.S. with cars like the Santa Fe Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid, so more models are coming, including to Genesis. Those cars will also be built in Georgia. ""This strategy will allow the company to respond swiftly to the North American market, which currently faces a shortage of hybrid supply, and to enhance the operational efficiency of the factory,"" Chang said.
Perhaps most importantly, Hyundai is targeting one thing for all of these electrified cars that has often eluded other automakers: actual profits across the board. ""The company expects to achieve equal profitability on its entire powertrain lineup, including ICE, hybrids, EREVs and EVs by 2030,"" Chang said.

The Electric Porsche Panamera Won't Kill The Gas Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/731426/porsche-electric-panamera-confirmed/,The two will peacefully coexist for many years.,2024-12-25 09:02:50,"Porsche is playing its cards right with the Cayenne by keeping the gas versions on sale even after the next-generation electric model arrives later this decade. The ICE car will be offered well into the 2030s. Porsche will follow a similar strategy for the Panamera.
Launched earlier this year, the third-generation Panamera has a long shelf life ahead of it. Speaking with Autocar, Porsche's research and development boss confirmed plans for an all-electric Panamera. Michael Steiner told the British magazine the model's duality will echo that of the SUV: ""The new Cayenne is fully electric, but for its whole lifespan we will have the ICE version in parallel. It's the same for the Panamera.""
Considering the electric Panamera launch date hasn't even been announced, and the ICE model will be available during the EV's life cycle, the gas car will likely remain on sale into the next decade. But where will the Panamera without a combustion engine fit in Porsche's lineup? Based on a previous statement made by CEO Oliver Blume, the car could slot above the Taycan: ""I think it could work [having both EVs] because they are playing in different segments. The Panamera is one step higher than the Taycan.""
Porsche has already applied this ICE+EV strategy with the gas and electric Macan models. Well, kind of. The conventionally powered crossover dies in 2026. Meanwhile, it has already been discontinued in Europe because it no longer complies with a stricter cybersecurity law that came into effect earlier this year.
For the same reason, the 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman are no longer for sale in the EU. The sports car duo remains available in other markets but it too will be retired at some point in 2025 to make way for electric replacements.
Porsche still hopes it will reach its target of having EVs account for 80% of sales by 2030 and is renewing the products to pave the way. The large three-row SUV coming later this decade will be exclusively electric. However, the Zuffenhausen-based company is a bit more cautious in terms of EV adoption now that it has realized ""this transition will happen slower in a lot of markets,"" according to Steiner.
He also believes synthetic fuel could help during this gradual switch from ICE to EV by blending e-fuels with gas: ""By the end of the decade, there could be a significant share of e-fuel in use. We could, little by little, gallon by gallon, substitute fossil fuel with e-fuel by mixing a blend.""
Since December 2022, Porsche has been producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile. As a refresher, the combustion engine is expected to get a new lease on life in the EU as sales of new ICE cars could continue after 2035 as long as they're powered by carbon-neutral fuel. However, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse is worried the legislation surrounding the use of synthetic fuels could turn out to be a ""bogus solution:""
""There are currently many indications that the EU Commission is striving for a bogus solution in which the ban on combustion engines is relaxed simply by ostensibly opening up to e-fuels. However, if it then does nothing to accelerate the ramp-up of low-CO2 fuels and make their use practicable, this would be a deliberate ban on combustion engines through the back door.""
Whatever the case may be, Porsche is not abandoning the development of combustion engines. Steiner said investments will continue to be made in the V-6 and V-8 to comply with tougher emissions regulations.

"Volkswagen ID. Buzz Starts At $59,995 In America, Gets So-So Range",https://insideevs.com/news/730811/vw-id-buzz-price-range/,"It's taken years, but the electric rebirth of Volkswagen's iconic Microbus is coming to America. Was it worth the wait?",2024-08-21 08:00:00,"The bus is back.
Though it's been on sale in its native Europe since summer 2022, and made its concept debut way back in 2017, the electric Volkswagen ID. Buzz is finally headed to the U.S. later this year. And when it arrives, it's not only going to be the long wheelbase version of the van, but also a pretty feature-loaded electric people-hauler.
But all that style comes at a price. The ID. Buzz will start at $59,995, excluding destination fees, with an EPA-estimated electric range of 234 miles for rear-wheel-drive models and 231 miles for all-wheel-drive models. All cars pack a 91-kWh battery.
That, unfortunately, is quite a bit less than the approximately 260 miles of range that many of us had anticipated. And it's both a far cry from the generally excellent range the Volkswagen ID.4 crossover puts out these days, and the three-row Kia EV9, where most trims get between 270 and 304 miles of EPA-rated range.
Then again, I'm not entirely convinced the ID. Buzz and EV9 are direct competitors—or that the ID. Buzz has any direct competitors. There's kind of nothing else like this on U.S. roads, and if you want one (and can afford one) then you're probably gonna go for it. And you'll turn a lot of heads everywhere you go.
Volkswagen officials said the ID. Buzz will come in three trims as a 2025 model when it arrives on dealer lots toward the end of this year: the base Pro S starting at $59,995, Pro S Plus at $63,495, and the launch-only 1st Edition at $65,495. The van also gets some North America-exclusive interior color options.
Here's how the various trims break down:
As we have reported previously, there is no seven-seat and AWD combination for the U.S.-spec ID. Buzz, so configurations work thusly:

A Cheaper Tesla Model 3 Has Arrived. But It's Not What You Think,https://insideevs.com/news/730514/tesla-model-3-mexico-interior/,Tesla has been promising more affordable models for a while. But this de-contented Model 3 from Mexico may not be what you had in mind.,2024-08-17 15:16:26,"The world is waiting for more affordable electric cars, but the world's top electric automaker (depending on how China's BYD is doing in any given quarter) hasn't quite delivered on that front. While lower-priced new competitors from General Motors, Kia, Stellantis, Ford and more are right around the corner, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has only vaguely committed to cheaper models amid its newfound focus on AI and autonomous driving technology.
Still, during a July earnings call, Musk reaffirmed that 2025 will bring new EVs that ""utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.”
So when we look at this new Model 3 variant that just dropped in Mexico, we have to wonder: is this what he meant? Or is it just a cheaper entryway into the Tesla brand for a burgeoning EV market?
Tesla Model 3 Cloth Interior
Regardless, meet the cheapest Model 3 that Mexico has ever seen. As spotted by Not A Tesla App, this Model 3 variant drops the vegan leather for cloth seats (I believe for the first time on a Tesla), no rear-facing screen, white-only ambient interior lighting and no options for heated seats or steering wheels. In doing so, it ditches a few updates from the new ""Highland"" Model 3 that debuted last year.
It's perhaps the most de-contented Tesla ever, more akin to a Toyota Corolla than any sort of premium or luxury car; while it's long been debatable whether the Model 3 even falls into that category, this one assuredly does not.
But is that such a bad thing? I'd argue not at all; in fact, this feels like one of the most basic, bare-bones EVs currently around, and you still get 438 km (about 272 miles) of electric range and a zero to 100 km/h (60 mph) time of just over six seconds.
Best of all, it is indeed cheaper. This rear-wheel-drive Model 3—which does not have a specific name—can be ordered for 749,000 pesos, or about $40,000 in the U.S. at current exchange rates. It's also 50,000 pesos cheaper than the previous Model 3 in Mexico and 130,000 pesos less than the next-most expensive Model 3, the Long Range Dual-Motor All-Wheel-Drive. I'm not sure I'd call Mexico a ""developing"" market these days, but there certainly is demand for EVs like this down there.
And there's certainly demand for more affordable EVs everywhere these days. So the question is, could this variant come to the U.S.—and does it preview a possible approach for Tesla to offer cheaper options without having to craft entirely new models? Your guess is as good as mine, because Tesla isn't exactly transparent with product plans these days. But I do think there would be a market for such a thing in the U.S., especially given how popular these are for ride-share drivers.

2025 Lamborghini Temerario: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/730034/lamborghini-temerario-horsepower-engine-price-details/,"The Huracan’s replacement has 920 horsepower, three electric motors, and a V-8 with a ridiculous 10,000 rpm redline.",2024-12-25 09:02:52,"The Lamborghini Huracán is gone, which means its lovely naturally aspirated V-10 engine is dead, too. But fans of fast Lamborghinis need not worry, there’s a new super sports car from Sant'Agata Bolognese that promises to be even more thrilling: Meet the Lamborghini Temerario.
Lamborghini calls the Temerario a High-Performance Electrified Vehicle—or, HPEV—and it packs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 plug-in hybrid setup with three electric motors. Total output is 920 horsepower, and it takes the Temerario just 2.7 seconds to reach 62 miles per hour. Top speed is 211 miles per hour.
Lamborghini built this new V-8 engine from the ground up. It has a 90-degree ""Hot V"" configuration and a flat-plane crankshaft, with two turbochargers running a maximum pressure of 36 psi. Cast aluminum alloy cylinder heads and titanium connecting rods help keep the weight down, while Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers in the valvetrain ensure the engine can spin up to 10,000 rpm.
Three oil-cooled, axial-flux electric motors join the V-8. Lamborghini stuck the rear motor between the engine and the transversely mounted eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. That electric motor alone produces up to 150 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque. The other two motors, located on the front axle, drive the front wheels and make 82 hp each. Yes, this new Lambo is all-wheel drive—but don't worry, there is a ""Drift Mode"" function that deploys torque at the rear wheels at three varying power levels. The Temerario also has a launch control function.
The battery pack has a capacity of 3.8 kilowatt hours. Plug the Temerario into a traditional AC charging port with up to 7 kilowatts of power, and the battery will recharge in 30 minutes. It can also be recharged through regenerative braking, or directly from the V-8 in as little as 6 minutes. You can drive using the front electric motors exclusively, but Lamborghini doesn't list an EV driving range for the Temerario.
Visually, the Temerario looks like a mix of the larger Revuelto and the outgoing Huracán. The headlights take up a small sliver of each corner of the hood—they’re slimmer even than the Huracán’s—and trendy hexagonal LED running lights sit just beneath them on each side of the front bumper. The Temerario has staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels with forged or carbon-fiber options.
In profile, the Temerario isn’t as sleek as the Huracán. It introduces a larger aerodynamic vent just ahead of the rear wheels that improves downforce by 103% compared to the Huracán Evo.
The Temerario Alleggerita lightweight package—with a larger rear wing, unique bumper treatments, and carbon fiber rims—debuts at launch and touts a 158% increase in downforce over the Huracán Evo, and a 55-pound weight reduction over the standard Temerario. Tack on the Carbon Pack, and that drops another 4 pounds through the use of carbon on the rear diffuser, mirror caps, and side air intakes.
Underneath the skin is a new lightweight chassis. Instead of the Huracán’s mixed aluminum and carbon-fiber build, the Temerario’s chassis is entirely aluminum. That yields a 50% drop in material use, 80% fewer heat-welded joints, and a 20% increase in torsional rigidity. It also helps keep the weight down.
Inside, the Tememerario has a cockpit-style cabin littered with hexagonal elements. Headroom improves by 1.3 inches over Huracán, and legroom improves by up to 1.8 inches. Even a 6-foot 6-inch NBA player could wear a helmet in this car, says Lamborghini.
An 8.4-inch vertical touchscreen graces the center of the dash, while the driver has access to a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and the passenger has a slightly smaller 9.1-inch touchscreen display.
One thing we don’t know yet is how much the Lamborghini Temerario costs. The outgoing Huracán Evo started at around $300,000 in the US, so it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility that the Temerario costs around $400,000 or even $500,000. We’ll know more about the Lamborghini Temerario when it goes on sale later this year or early in 2025.

The Rimac Nevera R Is Here. Its Specs Are Unbelievable,https://www.motor1.com/news/730067/rimac-nevera-r-revealed/,The Nevera R ditches the pretense of being a GT and becomes an all-out sports car. 0-60 mph takes 1.74 seconds.,2024-12-25 09:02:53,"Nobody has ever looked at the performance of a Rimac Nevera and thought “huh, maybe they’re holding back a bit.” But according to Rimac, the Nevera is a GT that happens to break records, not an all-out performance car. There was always more on the table, and now its being shown. Welcome to the 2,107 horsepower, 256 mile-per-hour, lowered, lightened, and wing-adorned Rimac Nevera R.
The Nevera R has all the typical stuff you'd expect from a hardcore track star—it’s lighter, more powerful, and more focused. Taking the bones of the Nevera meant that the R already had a spec sheet to end all spec sheets, but Rimac turned the wick up significantly. An extra 193 hp, a next-generation 108 kWh battery pack, and an undisclosed amount of weight reduction turn the Nevera R’s acceleration numbers comical. 0-60 mph takes just 1.74 seconds, 0-124 mph is an even more absurd 4.38 seconds, about as fast as a typical performance car’s 0-60 time. The most unbelievable numbers are the ¼ mile and 0-186 mph time. While it takes just 8.23 seconds to clear 1,320 feet, it takes just a little longer at 8.66 seconds for the Nevera R to reach 186 mph. It’s only the second street car in the 2,000 horsepower club after the Koenigsegg Gemera.
Acceleration is not the full story, however. In preparation to go record-smashing, the Nevera R also sees handling-focused upgrades. The new aero package includes a fixed wing, large diffuser, and a deeper front lip. The tires are now Michelin Cup 2s as standard, combined with more camber to produce more lateral traction. The All-Wheel Torque Vectoring program was retuned to take advantage of the extra mechanical and aero grip, while the steering system was refined for better response. Finally, a new generation of carbon ceramic brakes feature a silicone matrix layer to improve overall performance.
All said, the changes are good for a 3.8-second quicker lap time around the Nardo Handling Track. Dissecting that: The Nardo Handling Track is 3.8 miles long with a 0.6-mile long straightaway, which means the Nevera R is one second faster per mile of track. If that logic stands for the Nürburgring, then the Nevera R is almost certain to break the seven-minute barrier handily, and possibly take the challenge to the overall record holders. We’ll just have to wait and see.

The 2025 BMW M5 Touring Is A U.S.-Bound Plug-In Super Wagon,https://insideevs.com/news/730191/bmw-m5-touring-g99-reveal/,"BMW has only ever made two M5 wagons, and the G99 Touring is the third and most extreme.",2024-08-15 13:30:00,"BMW has pulled the wraps off the new G99 M5 Touring, the plug-in hybrid super wagon that’s coming to the United States. It has nearly identical specs and dimensions to the M5 sedan that we’ve already seen, but its long roof design makes it a third of an inch taller than the three-box.
It looks a lot like the i5 Touring M60 that we sampled not long ago but with blistered wheel arches and four exhausts poking out from under the massive diffuser. We really liked the look of the i5 Touring, which looks better in person than it does in the photos, and this M5 Touring will look even sportier, although it probably needs a darker color to hide its true size (and extra height over the previous generation of the model).
There has been a lot of talk about how much the M5 sedan weighs, which is 5,390 pounds, but the Touring variant is even heavier at 5,530 lbs. Getting this extra mass off the line adds one-tenth of a second to the acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph, which rises to 3.5 seconds. Both body styles are limited to 155 mph at the top end, which you can increase to 190 mph by selecting the optional M Driver’s Package.
The sprint time to 60 mph doesn’t tell the whole story with the M5. What’s more impressive is that it can hit 124 mph from a standstill in 11.1 seconds. Power is sent to all four wheels through a permanent xDrive system, but the car can decouple the front axle if all you want to do is turn the rear tires into smoke.
Power comes from the same twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 577 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. The eight-speed automatic gearbox incorporates a permanently excited synchronous electric motor, producing 194 hp and 207 lb-ft on its own. Total system output is a mighty 717 hp and 738 lb-ft, which should make the Touring’s extra 150 lbs disappear under hard acceleration.
The electric motor should feel even more torquey than it actually is, delivering “as much as 332 lb-ft at the transmission input for the motor with the help of a pre-gearing stage patented by BMW. This innovation enables the compact electric drive unit to generate effective propulsive power that could normally only be achieved using a far larger motor.”
Helping the car stick to the corners is an active four-wheel steering system coupled with variable-ratio steering. This system seems to rob new BMW models of some feel, but it improves the feeling of steering precision and you have to apply less lock to get the car to turn. There’s also an electronic M limited-slip differential working in the background to keep the rear of the car in check when you put the power down—it’s what also allows the car to pull massive smoky drifts.
With its 14.8 kWh battery, the M5 Touring has a maximum electric range of 25 miles and you can easily drive it at highway speeds on battery alone with its electric top speed of 87 mph. Charging the battery can only be done at up to 11 kW through the onboard AC charger; this isn’t one of those PHEVs that can DC fast-charge.
The interior layout is the same as in the sedan, with the same array of two curved screens dominating the dashboard. We’ve seen this interior in the i5 Touring, including the flat-bottom steering wheel with a red center marking, but the M5 will get more aggressive seats that are unique to the M model as well as other sporty touches to make it feel more special.
There’s also a big and very bright head-up display that projects directly onto the windscreen. What you see changes depending on the driving mode, but it can show you a full navigation map or a rev counter so that you don’t have to look down at the digital gauge cluster. The lower part of your field of view should catch the shift lights that appear at the top of the driver’s display.
The trunk grows from 16.5 cubic feet in the M5 sedan to 17.7 cu ft in the Touring. Folding the rear seat increases the available space to 57.6 cu ft. The M5 Touring comes with a pass-through so that you can carry skis inside the car without having to fold down any part of the rear seat.
When it arrives in the US, sometime after its Q4 2024 global launch, the M5 Touring will cost from $122,675 destination charge included.

"Pininfarina Battista Loses Its Roof, Instantly Gets Cooler",https://www.motor1.com/news/730211/pininfarina-battista-targamerica/,Pininfarina's electric hypercar becomes a targa for this one-off.,2024-12-25 09:02:55,"The Italians do convertibles so well. For further evidence, see this, the Pininfarina Battista Targamerica, an open-top version of the electric hypercar, which makes its debut Thursday for Monterey Car week.
The Targamerica is a coach-built one-off for a special Pininfarina client who already owns a Battista coupe. It's not the first convertible from the modern Automobili Pininfarina—that would be the B95 Speedster—but it is the first open-top Battista. It makes you wonder why the Battista wasn't a convertible to begin with.
Remarkably, it took just a year for the Targamerica to go from conception to reality, with the client comissioning the car at Monterey Car Week last year. Its silver-with-blue-accents livery pays homage to another one-off Pininfarina convertible, the Ferrari Testarossa Spider made for longtime Fiat scion Gianni Angelli in 1986. The rear decklid is unique to the Targamerica, too, as are the doors, which in the coupe are integrated into the roof. Another notable feature is a cigar humidor integrated between the seats. Apparently the client likes their stogies.
Pininfarina Battista Targamerica
As a brief reminder, the Battista is the creation of Automobili Pininfarina, a German-headquartered offshoot of the legendary Italian design house, owned by India's Mahindra. The Battista is based on the Rimac Nevera hypercar, and offers an astonishing 1,900 horsepower from its four electric motors.
Automobili Pininfarina is showing the Targamerica at The Quail on Friday, after which point the client will take delivery. The automaker didn't say whether it'll build more Battista convertibles, we suspect this won't be the last.

Like most performance-minded EV noises, the exhaust uses input from the driver and the car to adjust sound and volume.
Specifically, the Fratzonic exhaust uses inputs like acceleration and deceleration, and makes noises when the car turns on and off. You can even ""rev"" the Charger EV, or just listen to it idle like any gas-powered car. It'll also make a distinct noise if you use the ""PowerShot"" function, which adds 40 horsepower for up to 15 seconds with the push of a button.
A two-minute video released by Dodge shows a Charger Daytona Scat Pack accelerating past a camera before pulling off a smoky donut. After that, we get a few seconds of the car ""idling."" It sounds like a real V-8 to us, but obviously, it's all still fake.
What we don't hear, strangely, are any simulated gears shifting. After Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, we suspected every performance EV going forward would have a feature like that, as it enhances the driving experience exponentially, and gives purpose to all of the synthetic noises. A Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 the Charger does not have any feature of the sort.
So even if you do enjoy the nice V-8 burble from the Charger EV, there's no way to bang through gears or bounce off a ""redline."" It's like pairing a Hemi to a CVT. And that sounds like no fun at all.
Are you a fan of the Fratzonic exhaust? Do you think Dodge made the right call not including fake gears? Let us know in the comments.

"The Dodge Charger EV's Frunk Is Optional, For Some Reason",https://www.motor1.com/news/729505/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-frunk-optional/,"If you want a little extra storage in your Charger Daytona EV, you'll need to go for a pricey option package.",2024-12-25 09:02:56,"We noticed a curious detail in the press release announcing pricing for the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV. One of the features listed with the $4,995 Plus Group is, simply, ""Frunk."" Wait. Does this mean the front trunk is optional?
Indeed it does, a Dodge spokesperson confirmed to Motor1 yesterday.
Bizarrely, Dodge isn't the first to do this. At least in the U.K., the new Audi Q6 E-Tron's frunk is a £500 a-la-carte option. (Audi is yet to release packaging information on the U.S.-spec Q6 E-Tron.) But to the best of our recollection, that's the only other instance of this, EV or otherwise. In the Charger Daytona EV, it's not huge—a video from TFLEV notes it offers 1.5 cubic feet of storage—but it's enough for charging cables and other smaller items.
The Plus Group adds a number of other features to the Charger Daytona including cooled seats, LED lighting, a power rear hatch, wireless phone charging, 20 inch wheels for the base R/T model, and more. Still, this appears to be an odd bit of cost cutting—not including a simple piece of molded plastic under the hood as standard. But, the new Charger Daytona surely won't be as abundantly profitable as the old gas-powered Charger and Challenger, so Dodge has to find ways to eke out margins where it can.
The Charger Daytona is expensive as it is, too. Base price for the R/T is $61,950 and that rises to $75,185 for the Scat Pack, though both do qualify for a $7,500 tax credit when leased. Dodge may yet come out with cheaper models, though. A Dodge spokesperson tells us that ""[f]uture model years will see the Charger Daytona lineup expand to cover a larger portion of the muscle car segment.""

The Latest Rolls-Royce One-Off Is An Extremely Yellow Spectre,https://www.motor1.com/news/729067/rolls-royce-spectre-semaphore/,The Spectre Semaphore gets its own unique paint and a trippy two-tone hood.,2024-12-25 09:02:57,"Rolls-Royce is bringing something special to Monterey this year. This very yellow coupe is called the Spectre Semaphore, a one-off special build that wears a handful of bespoke customizations, including a trippy paint job for the hood and a very bright two-tone interior.
The flashy hue is called Semaphore Yellow, a color crafted specifically for this commission, says Rolls. On the hood is a unique artwork dubbed ""Marble Paint Spill."" Inspired by Californian artists, it's a collection of silver lacquer and multiple layers of clear coat to create what looks like a pool of mixed yellow and silver paint. Rolls-Royce says the hood alone required 160 hours of labor to design and produce.
Sticking with the very yellow color scheme, the interior of the Spectre Semaphore uses a combination of Lemon Yellow and Citrine Yellow to brighten the white seats, doors, and dashboard trim. Wrapping things together is Lemon Yellow stitching, naturally. Rolls was even able to make the center dial in the gauge cluster yellow.
There's no mention of drivetrain changes, meaning the Spectre Semaphore's dual-motor electric drivetrain is likely untouched. It's rated at a combined 577 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque from the factory, with up to 291 miles of range.
Rolls describes the Semaphore as capturing ""the bold new codes of luxury being established by the marque’s confident, youthful client base.""
Into the design? You're in luck. Unlike most bespoke commissions from the brand, this one hasn't been pre-sold. Rolls says it's available to purchase through any authorized dealer in the United States. Though presumably, you'll have to act fast since this is the only one that exists.
The one-off Spectre will make its debut at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering, on August 16 during Monterey Car Week.

Dodge's New EV 'Exhaust' Sounds Way Better Than We Expected,https://www.motor1.com/news/729243/dodge-charger-ev-new-v8-sound/,"It might not be a real V-8, but it's pretty convincing.",2024-12-25 09:02:57,"Dodge's new all-electric Charger is shrouded in controversy. Not only is the Hemi V-8 gone, but it's been replaced with a fake ""Fratzonic"" exhaust sound that doesn't have the internet convinced. The latest version of the sound, revealed this week, should convince at least a few people, though.
The company published a video to Instagram on Monday showing off the latest iteration of the Fratzonic exhaust. We watch and listen as a Charger Daytona EV blasts through a tunnel, outputting what sounds like a good old-fashioned V-8 sound.
The sound is a far cry from the original noise out of the debut in 2022, which was met with a ton of hate. In 2023, Dodge went as far as to change the sound with something resembling an engine, which sounded better but seemingly failed to convince the buying public. And while this latest noise sounds almost exactly like a real V-8, the internet isn't buying it.
""Lol we want real V-8 noises ... not a speaker,"" one comment reads. ""We still want HEMIs,"" says another. ""I’d rather have no car than one of these,"" one commenter says.
Dodge has voiced its struggles with the Fratzonic exhaust since its original reveal. ""We've changed it 100 times,"" CEO Tim Kuniskis confessed to reporters back in March. The system uses a speaker (or speakers) mounted inside an exhaust-like chamber to mimic the sound of a real exhaust.
Judging by the public's reaction to this whole fake exhaust speaker thing, it's clear that people don't actually care whether an electric car sounds like an ICE-powered car or not. Even if the Charger Daytona EV sounds exactly like a Hellcat, people won't be convinced, because they'll know it's not the real thing.
It's like slapping an M badge on a non-M BMW. The only people that care about the badge will also know it's a fake. Likewise, anyone that cares about the exhaust sound coming from a Charger EV will know it's not the real thing.

The A6 E-Tron Is Audi's First Rear-Wheel Drive Sedan In A Century,https://www.motor1.com/news/728466/audi-a6-e-tron-rwd/,"No, really. To find another rear-drive Audi sedan, you have to go back before the War.",2024-12-25 09:02:58,"A rear-wheel drive sedan isn't abnormal, but one with Audi's four rings on the front? That is very, very unusual. But believe it or not, the base Audi A6 E-Tron—the new electric version of Audi's longstanding mid-size sedan—drives just its rear wheels.
Audi is, of course, a brand defined by its Quattro all-wheel drive system, but it built front-wheel drive cars for much of its history. You have to go all the way back to the Audi 920 of the late 1930s to find an earlier rear-wheel drive Audi sedan than this new A6. And for all of its modern history, the company has only built front or all-wheel drive cars. The only exceptions are the rear-wheel drive versions of the R8 supercar and the base Q4 E-Tron crossover.
Quick history lesson: Audi was formed around the turn of the 20th century, and in 1932, it became part of the Auto Union along with fellow German companies Horch, Wanderer, and DKW. Hence the four rings of the Audi logo. After the War, the Audi name was dropped until the mid-1960s, when Auto Union revived it in favor of DKW.
Most modern Audis can trace their lineage to the DKW F9, which was designed in the early days of World War II as a successor to the Volkswagen Beetle. As an excellent video from the B Sport YouTube channel explains, Auto Union ran with the F9's drivetrain layout of a longitudinal engine ahead of a transmission sending power to the front wheels. In gas-powered cars larger than the A3, it's the layout Audi still uses to this day, albeit often with the addition of a driveshaft going to the rear in the classic Quattro all-wheel drive system. This includes the A6 and all its predecessors.
All of this is to say that there are decades of tradition here, which the A6 E-Tron breaks with. Of course, many single-motor EVs are rear-wheel drive for a variety of reasons, so on some level, it's not that unusual. Plus, the A6's rivals—the Tesla Model S, BMW i5, and Mercedes EQE—are all rear-wheel drive in base form. Still, it's astonishing that this is the first modern, rear-wheel-drive Audi sedan.
Going electric changes everything. This break from tradition doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things, yet it's certainly notable given Audi's history. But, a rear-wheel drive sedan is almost always a good thing, so the base A6 E-Tron might be a sweet spot in the Audi range.

This Is The Most Powerful Porsche Panamera Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/727030/most-powerful-porsche-panamera-ever/,The pricey Turbo S E-Hybrid arrives alongside a new GTS.,2024-12-25 09:02:58,"Days after setting a Nürburgring record, the hottest Panamera of them all is official. Porsche debuted the Turbo S E-Hybrid equipped with an electrified V-8 engine making serious power. Not only is it more potent than its predecessor but it also comes with a substantial battery upgrade. Sticky tires, a carbon fiber aero kit, and a rich list of standard equipment boost its appeal.
At the heart of the range-topper is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter engine making 591 horsepower. Built into the eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, the electric motor belts out another 187 hp. Together, the two deliver a combined 771 hp, lending the new Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid a substantial 81-hp advantage over the old model. At the same time, torque has jumped by 96 pound-feet to a mountain-moving 737 lb-ft.
Courtesy of the extra electrified muscle, the flagship Panamera is now two-tenths of a second quicker to 60 mph by completing the task in just 2.8 seconds. Flat out, it hits 202 mph, making it 8 mph faster than the old one. But wait, it gets even better. Porsche has increased the gross capacity of the battery pack by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours, resulting in a higher electric range.
Sitting at the top of the food chain, the (takes a deep breath) Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid gets the good stuff as standard. The ceramic brakes are included from the get-go, as are the forged 21-inch centerlock wheels. There are still a few boxes on the options list you can tick, namely an aero kit and Michelin tires. The former increases downforce by 132 pounds at 124 mph while the latter is a bespoke Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber.
Porsche is already accepting orders and wants an eye-watering $228,495 before options. If that’s out of your price range, the Panamera lineup also adds a GTS trim for the 2025 model year. The Gran Turismo Sport costs a more attainable $156,195, with both prices including destination and handling feels. While the Turbo S E-Hybrid is the most powerful of the lot, the GTS is claimed to be the most agile.
2025 Porsche Panamera GTS
The Panamera GTS packs 493 hp or 20 hp more than the previous generation. It needs 3.6 seconds to hit 60 mph from a standstill, so it's a tenth of a second quicker. At full tilt, it does 188 mph. Compared to a more plebian version, the GTS sits 0.4 inches lower after tweaking the standard air suspension. In addition, the engineers from Zuffenhausen have beefed up the anti-roll bars and worked on the limited-slip differential for a more engaging drive.
Both new flavors of the Panamera will reach US dealers near the end of Q1 2025.

Chevy Silverado EV's More Affordable LT Trim: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/726794/silverado-ev-lt-trail-boss/,The cheaper LT model and off-road-ready Silverado EV Trail Boss are due next year.,2024-07-16 12:00:53,"Chevrolet's Silverado EV is still only trickling out of the factory. We’ve only seen two trims of the electric full-sized pickup truck: the fleet-oriented WT trim and the fully loaded, nearly six-figure RST trim. But now, Chevy has released images and some details of the more moderately priced yet still well-equipped versions of the Silverado EV in LT trim on its website.
Right now, both the WT and RST trucks on sale are far from cheap. The RST’s roughly $96,000 MSRP is way out of the realm of affordability for many truck buyers. It’s also well above its direct competitor, the Ford F-150 Lightning. The WT trim is somewhat cheaper at around $75,000, but that, too, is very expensive.
Also, its black bumpers, steel wheels, and spartan interior trim won’t be to the tastes of the average consumer, who would appreciate a bit of glitz and glamour with their electric pickup.
General Motors Has Best Quarter Ever For EVs
General Motors's EV sales were up 40% compared to last year. Q2 was its best quarter ever for EV sales, with the Silverado EV and Blazer EV making up a substantial portion of its sales numbers.
This Silverado EV in LT trim splits the difference, adding style without going overboard and increasing the price too much. The LT model has a slightly different front bumper, but still has the LED light bar and illuminated Chevrolet badge as the topmost RST trim. It has large two-tone wheels. However, the cladding along the wheel arches and rocker panels is matte grey like the WT trim, instead of gloss black like on the RST model.
2025 Silverado EV LT Rear
Equipment-wise, the LT should be a step up from the WT as it will include some features we’ve already seen on that top-level truck. It will have the same 17.7-inch infotainment and 11.3-inch driver display screens, running the same Google-based (and Apple CarPlay-less) software. It does appear that the convertible Multi-Flex Tailgate, which allows the truck bed’s tailgate to accommodate much longer loads, will be an option.
Chevrolet also released an image of the Silverado EV Trail Boss but didn’t include many details aside from a picture and the promise that it will be able to “tackle anything from twisted trails to tight turns” and have “superior capability and groundbreaking technology.”
Chevy Silverado EV Trail Boss
We don’t know much about the new models' range, power, or price quite yet. But we expect the Silverado LT to have a smaller battery than the RST’s massive 213 kWh pack and way less power than the staggering 754 horsepower figure of the top-of-the-line truck. When it goes on sale in 2025, the Silverado EV LT could start around $60,000, making it a much more affordable option than the $96,000 Silverado EV RST First Edition we drove recently—and a more direct competitor to the F-150 Lightning.

Nissan Ariya Nismo Heads To Europe To Resurrect Performance Brand,https://insideevs.com/news/726776/nissan-ariya-nismo-ev-europe/,"With several performance tweaks, the go-fast Ariya crossover is the first Nismo-branded car in Europe since the 370Z went bust.",2024-07-16 10:00:08,"Nismo, Nissan’s performance arm, will return to Europe with the battery-powered Ariya crossover after a four-year hiatus.
But unlike the version that’s available in Japan, the Europe-bound Nissan Ariya Nismo might be more show and less go, at least from the information we currently have on hand. That’s quite different from what European customers have been accustomed to in the past with Nismo-branded models like the 370Z and Juke, which had more power and pizzaz than the standard versions.
Nismo returns to Europe
After the demise of the Nissan 370Z in Europe at the end of 2019, the Japanese automaker's performance arm, Nismo, has been nowhere to be seen. That's about to change with the introduction of the Ariya Nismo sporty electric crossover.
The official press release doesn’t mention specifics about power, torque, acceleration or top speed, but a dead giveaway is the following statement: “The Ariya NISMO brings a new level of exhilaration to the already excellent performance of the 87KWh Ariya e-4ORCE.”
More Nissan Ariya News
That’s the version with the biggest battery and dual motors, which makes 389 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque–both in Europe and the United States. That’s not to say it’s short on power, but to put things into perspective, the most powerful version of the Japanese-spec Ariya Nismo, dubbed B9, gets a 91-kWh battery and a maximum output of 320 hp and 443 lb-ft. Compared to the regular Ariya, that’s 10% higher.
That said, for Europe, Nismo fine-tuned the e-4ORCE all-wheel drive system for better power and torque distribution, tweaked the suspension, installed “finely tuned” brake pads and revised the interior to make it sportier. Inside, the color theme is red on black with Nismo seats.
Outside, the Nissan Ariya Nismo gets a black-and-red body kit, new 20-inch wheels, revised front and rear bumpers and a rear spoiler above the rear window.
That’s a big bummer for Nismo fans. Cars like the discontinued 370Z Nismo and even the peculiar Juke Nismo had more of everything, including power, making for some very interesting driving characteristics. Now though, it seems like Nismo is becoming the equivalent of Mercedes-Benz’s AMG Line, BMW’s M Sport and Hyundai’s N Line trim options.
The European version of the go-fast electric crossover will be fully unveiled during the season finale of the Formula E championship in London this weekend when we should learn more about the Ariya Nismo, like how much power it actually makes and how much it costs.
The sporty EV will be available in all European markets where the regular version is already available, Nissan said.",Iulian Dnistran
The Lucid Air Just Hit A Huge EV Milestone,https://insideevs.com/news/726704/lucid-air-2025-efficiency-range/,"The EV startup announced some tweaks to its 2025 lineup. Most notably, the Air is now the country's most efficient EV by a wide margin.",2024-07-16 09:00:01,"Lucid announced tweaks to its Air sedan lineup for the 2025 model year on Tuesday. The biggest development? The startup’s entry-level model now achieves a landmark 5 miles of driving range per kilowatt-hour (kWh), making it the most efficient electric car you can buy, according to Lucid's calculations.
The 2025 Air Pure manages to eke out 420 miles of Environmental Protection Agency-estimated range from an 84-kWh battery pack. Note that EPA ratings are for plug-to-road efficiency, including charging losses, so EPA efficiency figures won't match the 5.0 mi/kWh Lucid claims. The good news, though, is that the added efficiency doesn't come with added cost. The 2025 model costs $69,900, just like before.
Lucid Motors
The California-based EV startup began selling the Air sedan in 2021. It's earned a reputation for exceptional technology but hasn't turned a profit yet. The company is betting its upcoming Gravity SUV and future models will bring it mass-market volumes and financial stability.
“Lucid Air is the very embodiment of our relentless approach to optimization, enabling Air Pure to use less electrical energy than any other vehicle for any journey taken, A to B,” said Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO of Lucid, in a statement.
According to the EPA, which doesn't list the 2025 Air Pure on its website yet, the most efficient EV in the U.S. is the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6, rated at 4.2 mi/kWh. The Tesla Model 3 and 2024 Air Pure are up near the top too, while big pickup trucks like the Ford F-150 Lightning require considerably more energy to propel themselves than those energy-sipping models. Lucid said it got to 5 mi/kWh by adding a heat pump, which can cool and heat the Pure’s cabin with less energy, and through other tweaks.
On its face, EV efficiency may sound dull compared to more tangible, exciting specs like range and neck-snapping zero-to-60-mph times. But maximizing efficiency is a key way to make EVs work better for people, and it’s a central philosophy for Rawlinson and Lucid.
Better efficiency means the company can shrink its battery packs, thus reducing input costs for each vehicle. Indeed, the 2024 Air Pure has an 88-kWh pack and gets ever so slightly less EPA range than the 2025 model. For drivers, less energy consumption contributes to speedier charging stops, because every kWh dispensed results in more mileage.
Lucid announced a few other updates to 2025 Airs, which are available to order as of Tuesday. A heat pump, which previously was only found in top-end models, is now standard across the board. The infotainment system has triple the processing power and twice the memory of the previous generation, which Lucid said results in a “significantly enhanced and faster in-car infotainment experience.”
More EV Startup News
All Airs now come with DreamDrive Premium, which adds a 360-degree camera view and blind-spot camera views to the car’s driver-assistance suite. The Air Touring and Grand Touring each get a $1,000 price hike, bringing them to $78,900 and $110,900, respectively. The 2025 Grand Touring has an estimated 512 miles of range, slightly less than before but still by far the most of any electric car in the U.S.
The next couple of years will be pivotal for Lucid. Even if it has some of the best technology in the EV market—and this efficiency milestone solidifies that—it has yet to make a profitable business out of that.
The startup is burning through cash quickly—it reported a net loss of $2.8 billion in 2023—and is largely looking past the Air for future growth. It hopes that the Gravity SUV (which starts production later this year) and its upcoming more affordable vehicle will deliver the kinds of volumes needed for financial sustainability.

Porsche's New Macan Trim Addresses Its Biggest Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/726721/porsche-macan-macan-4s-specs-price/,"The newly introduced rear-wheel drive Porsche Macan is the cheapest of the bunch, but there’s also a new Macan 4S.",2024-07-16 08:00:00,"The 2024 Porsche Macan is available in two new trim levels that complete the electric crossover’s range, at least for now. Furthermore, a new off-road design pack can be specced as an option for all versions.
After debuting in Macan 4 and Macan Turbo trims at the beginning of the year, the German EV can be had in either rear-wheel drive form (called simply Macan) or in Macan 4S guise.
A Macan for (nearly) everybody
In usual Porsche fashion, the all-electric Macan was first available in some of its priciest versions, but that's fixed now, as the German company launched two more trims, including a new entry-level model called simply Macan. It's the only rear-wheel drive trim and it's also the cheapest, but don't call it cheap.
The introduction of the base Macan solves one of the biggest problems with the battery-powered sports crossover, and that’s the price. But while it is the cheapest of the lineup, starting at $77,295 including destination, you can’t exactly call it cheap. Meanwhile, the Macan 4S, which slots between the Macan 4 and Macan Turbo, starts at $86,895 including destination charge.
More Porsche EV Stories
All versions are powered by the same 800-volt, 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack that can be recharged at a maximum rate of 270 kilowatts for a 10 to 80% top-up in around 21 minutes, according to Porsche.
The entry-level, rear-wheel drive Macan has a single electric motor–the same as the one fitted on the rear axle of the Macan 4–that has a maximum output of 250 kW (335 horsepower) and 415 pound-feet of torque with Launch Control enabled. The zero to 60 miles per hour sprint is done in 5.4 seconds, while the top speed is 136 miles per hour.
The cheapest electric Macan is also the lightest, with Porsche saying that it’s 243 pounds thinner than the Macan 4. This means it will likely boast the longest driving range of the lineup, seeing how all trims have the same battery, but the German automaker doesn’t have exact range numbers yet, and the EPA ratings aren’t available either.
When the Macan 4 and Macan Turbo debuted earlier this year, the WLTP rating was between 321-381 miles, so it’s possible that the new, lighter Macan RWD could go at least 300 miles on a full charge in real-world conditions, but we’ll have to see it to believe it.
Moving on to the more powerful Macan 4S, it features a beefier rear electric motor and a stronger 600-amp silicon carbide pulse inverter, whereas the rear-wheel drive Macan has a 480-amp pulse inverter with silicon carbide transistors.
Porsche says the new Macan 4S has a total system output of 330 kW (442 hp) with a maximum output of up to 380 kW (509 hp) when overboost is engaged. With Launch Control activated, the maximum torque is 578 lb-ft, allowing for a 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.9 seconds.
So, for a quick roundup of the Macan lineup, we have the rear-wheel drive version with up to 335 hp and 415 lb-ft, the Macan 4 with up to 402 hp and 479 lb-ft, the Macan 4S with up to 509 hp and 578 lb-ft, and finally the Macan Turbo with up to 630 hp and 833 lb-ft. Traditionally, Porsche has offered a Turbo S variant of its cars at some point during their lives, so it could be possible that the electric Macan will get an even more powerful trim, but we’ll have to wait and see if that happens.
Getting back to the new stuff, both the rear-drive Macan and the Macan 4S come as standard with Porsche’s Adaptive Air Suspension and the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), while rear-wheel steering is optional. On the Macan 4S, customers can also choose the Torque Vectoring Plus feature from the options list.
The German sports car also introduced a new off-road design package that can be applied to any Macan trim. It includes a new front bumper that improves the approach angle to 17.5 degrees depending on the model and with the air suspension raised to its highest level. With the standard air suspension in the normal setting, the off-road design package increases the ground clearance by four-tenths of an inch (10 millimeters) to a total of 7.6 inches and tops out at 8.8 inches in its highest setting.
A new exterior color called Slate Grey Neo, as well as a 20-inch wheel design for the Macan S are new arrivals on the features list.
The 2024 Porsche Macan and 2024 Porsche Macan 4S are available to order now, with deliveries expected to begin in the fourth quarter. The electric Macan is manufactured in Leipzig, Germany, so it’s not eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit when purchasing, but leasing might make it eligible.",Iulian Dnistran
New Ford Capri: Here's A Detailed Video Walkaround,https://insideevs.com/news/726241/ford-capri-video-preview/,"Is this tall electric sedan a ""real"" Capri? If the Mustang Mach-E is any indication, that question may not matter.",2024-07-11 09:11:56,"My first thought when I saw the reactions to the new Ford Capri online: ""Here we go again.""
There's apparently a lot of hand-wringing about whether this new Capri is a ""real Capri"" or not. After all, this new car is an electric four-door sedan-hatch thing with a ride height that gives it SUV vibes, while the old Capri was an iconic European performance coupe—two doors, classic proportions and aimed at younger buyers who wanted something exciting.
Ford's challenges in Europe
Like a lot of automakers, Ford is losing ground in China and now it's facing Chinese EV rivals in Europe too, where it has long had a strong presence. Using VW's electric platform may help Ford get more cars on the road in the interim, but eventually, it's got to find ways to seriously compete in Europe or back down like General Motors did.
This will sound familiar to anyone who saw, or participated in, the online debates about whether the Ford Mustang Mach-E is a ""real Mustang"" or not. And I think the end result will be the same with the Capri: it won't matter. If the Capri is good enough, it'll stand on its own merits, just like the Mach-E does.
Of course, this situation is a bit different, since critics will likely argue that it's not even a ""real"" Ford. Underneath the Capri's handsome-but-blatantly-Polestar-ish skin is Volkswagen's MEB platform, such that it's basically a Ford-themed reskin of the Volkswagen ID.5. VW had long intended to license out its MEB platform to other automakers, and since Ford doesn't yet have its own true, dedicated EV architecture—cars like the Mach-E and F-150 Lightning are extensively modified versions of gas-powered platforms—this move helps the American automaker get more EVs on the road more quickly. This will change when Ford gets its own purpose-built EV platform out the door, but that's still a few years off.
Then again, how much does your everyday, average buyer know or care what platform their EV uses? I'm reminded of that stat about how many BMW drivers didn't know they had rear-wheel-drive cars, so the Bavarians started cranking out more front-wheel-drive ones instead.
Ford Capri (2024)
From what I can see across the pond where the car will not be sold, there's a lot to like here. Over at the Electrifying YouTube channel, host Ginny Buckley—who's a Capri fan and skeptic of the new design—says to ""put that car out of your mind"" as she dives deep into the coupe-SUV. She notes that this new Capri would absolutely smoke any of the previous gas versions, and it offers single- and dual-motor versions and even an upcoming smaller battery size for buyers who don't need as much distance.
Buckley notes that the Capri does look considerably better than the also-VW-based Ford Explorer EV. The ""boot"" here definitely takes a page from the Polestar 2 playbook (if not the entire book) with a fastback-type hatch opening and a good amount of space with the rear seats down. The rear doors, however, seem pretty narrow, especially when you're on carseat duty.
Ford Capri interior
But there are some nice nods to the original Capri too, including ones this clueless American writer didn't know about. The headrests are integrated into the entire seat, old-school-style, and the steering wheel has a metallic 6 p.m. spoke with rally-style holes in it.
The center touch screen can slide forward or back, tilting to be flush against the dashboard or more angled for easier driver reach. The Capri also boasts an upgraded software system from what's in the Mach-E, and charger location and app integration are better than ever. So, yes; these cars use a Ford software system, not a Volkswagen one. And the rest of the interior doesn't scream VW either, it's all pretty cohesive in there.
Will European audiences warm up to this new electric Capri? Even Buckley admits it's maybe not as aspirational as the original coupe was, and the Polestar 2's sales haven't exactly been setting new records as of late. But it could help Ford gain some ground in the EV race, where it's particularly behind in Europe.
I know most Americans have no idea what a Capri is unless they have vague memories of Mercury, but I wish this thing was sold on our side of the Atlantic too. I'm weirdly into it.

Mini John Cooper Works Electric: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/725200/mini-cooper-jcw-ev-official/,"It’s supposed to be covered in camouflage, but we can see everything, Mini.",2024-07-03 18:01:00,"The previous-generation Mini hatchback in John Cooper Works trim was a hoot to drive. Now, with the latest-gen model, the British marque is adamant that the go-kart feeling won’t go anywhere, even in the case of the all-electric version.
Say hello, then, to the all-new Mini John Cooper Works E, albeit in prototype form. These are the first official photos of the sporty three-door EV hatchback which will make its dynamic debut at next week’s Goodwood Festival of Speed in the United Kingdom. But wait, wasn’t there a JCW Mini already? Well, yes, but only sort of. Let me explain.
Will Mini's smallest EV come to the U.S.?
As of today, the only all-new Minis available in the United States are the gas-powered Countryman crossover and three- and four-door Cooper hatchbacks. In the case of the battery-powered Cooper, including the new John Cooper Works, it might never make it here because it's made in China and Chinese-built EVs face huge import tariffs starting next month.
The latest-gen Mini Cooper EV is indeed available with some JCW badges if you want to spend some extra cash over the basic version, but it’s just a trim level. Think BMW’s M Sport models–they’re not true M cars but they carry M badges. BMW makes money and the owner is happy, so Mini is going down the same route.
More Stories About Mini
The new Mini John Cooper Works E, however, is the real deal. Expected to go on sale toward the end of this year or early next year, the top-spec three-door electric Mini could get up to 250 horsepower from a front-mounted electric motor fed by a roughly 50-kilowatt-hour battery.
These specs aren’t official, though, so take them with a grain of salt. That said, the production Mini Cooper SE has 214 hp and a 54.2-kWh battery pack that’s good for a WLTP-rated range of 249 miles on a full charge. Mini will likely use the same battery to feed a slightly more potent e-motor at the front, all while tuning the chassis to supercharge the go-kart feeling that the brand’s models are known for.
The company didn’t say a thing about what’s new and improved on the upcoming John Cooper Works E, but we have eyes and can spot a sportier front bumper, a pretty consistent roof-mounted spoiler at the rear and an integrated diffuser in the rear bumper. There are no photos of the interior, but we expect a pretty similar look to the JCW trim that’s available on the Cooper SE, including a round infotainment screen, funky dashboard covers and a JCW-themed steering wheel and seats.
Mini did say that the prototype that will race up the Goodwood hill climb is covered in a camouflage designed to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the historic win at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally where a Mini Cooper S finished first. The company also said that besides an electric version, the new John Cooper Works will also be available with a combustion engine.",Iulian Dnistran
"2026 Genesis Electrified G80 Packs Bigger Battery, 27-Inch Screen",https://insideevs.com/news/724837/2026-genesis-electrified-g80-facelift-specs-battery-interior/,The updated battery-powered sedan debuted in its home country of South Korea with a longer wheelbase and more niceties inside.,2024-06-28 08:00:09,"In the realm of electric sedans, you may not think of the Genesis Electrified G80 all that much. It's hardly a big-volume, mainstream car for Genesis or even the Hyundai Motor Group as a whole. But with some upgrades for 2026, the battery-powered G80 may be more worth your attention than ever.
Revealed at this year’s Busan International Mobility Show (BIMOS) in South Korea, the updated sedan has a longer wheelbase, a bigger battery pack and more niceties inside and out.
Electric G80 follows in the combustion version's footsteps
The gas-powered Genesis G80 got a mid-cycle refresh last year, and now it's time for the battery-powered model to get many of the same updates.
Expected to arrive in the United States later this year as a 2026 model, the new Electrified G80 will likely boast an improved range rating compared to the current EPA estimate of 282 miles on a full charge.
Let’s start with the technical stuff. The redesigned Electrified G80 has a 5.1-inch longer wheelbase compared to the outgoing model (123.6 in versus 118.5 in), which allowed Genesis to stuff a slightly larger lithium-ion battery pack into the floor–95.4 kilowatt-hours versus the old 87.2 kilowatt-hours unit.
More Genesis Stories
As a result, the range rating in its home market went up from 265 miles to 295 miles on a full charge, an 11% improvement. The range rating (or any other specifics, for that matter) isn’t yet available for the U.S. market, but applying the same 11% increase would result in a theoretical EPA range of 313 miles. Take that with a grain of salt, though, at least until Genesis brings the updated sedan stateside.
Even though the Korean automaker said the wheelbase was increased, it didn’t mention anything about the length of the car. The outgoing model is 197 inches long, so logic dictates the updated model would measure 202.1 inches long, but we’ll know more when the EV officially comes to the States.
The same extended wheelbase that made more room for a bigger battery pack is responsible for some extra legroom for the rear passengers, who can now benefit from plush VIP reclining seats with leg rests and a memory feature. Meanwhile, the new EasyClose system allows them to close the doors with a push of a button–just like in a Rolls-Royce.
Up front, the old 14.5-inch center infotainment screen is gone, and in its place, there’s a new, 27-inch OLED display that combines the gauge cluster and infotainment under a single piece of glass.
Outside, the company’s so-called G-Matrix Crest Grille has been slightly redesigned, the headlights now feature something called Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology and there are new chrome details all around the zero-emissions sedan. Dish-style 19-inch wheels are offered as standard and the front bumper has also been slightly tweaked, design-wise.
The facelifted Genesis Electrified G80 will go on sale in South Korea in August, with Europe, the United States and other global markets soon to follow. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but we expect the 2026 Electrified G80 to be slightly more expensive than the outgoing model which starts at $75,625 (including destination).",Iulian Dnistran
Hyundai Inster: This New Affordable Electric City Car Looks Fantastic,https://insideevs.com/news/723917/hyundai-inster-ev-official-range-power-specs-price/,"Based on the South Korean-spec Casper, Hyundai’s new city EV goes to Europe with an extended wheelbase and two battery options.",2024-06-26 20:45:00,"This is the all-new Hyundai Inster. An entry-level, A-segment electric city car designed specifically for Europe that will likely compete with the Chinese-made Dacia Spring, which is one of the cheapest cars on sale in the European Union.
Keen-eyed observers might have noticed that the new Inster looks pretty much identical to the Korean-market Casper, and you’d be right. But looks aren’t everything, as Hyundai seems to have done its homework and didn’t just slap some lipstick and bolt a big battery under what was originally a combustion-powered urban runabout.
The race for affordable EVs is on
First, there was the Dacia Spring EV, which debuted with a starting price of around $20,000 in Europe a few years ago. Now, more and more automakers are trying to cash in on the affordable EV craze in Europe, including Stellantis, Volkswagen and Hyundai.
The biggest change for the European-bound Inster EV is a stretched, 101.5-inch (2,580-millimeter) wheelbase, bringing it closer to a subcompact or B-segment car. That’s 7 inches more than the gas-powered Casper it’s based on, 6 inches more than the Dacia Spring and 10 inches more than the rather pricy Fiat 500e.
More Affordable EV Stories
Measuring 150.6 inches long, 63.3 inches wide and 62 inches tall, the new Inster EV is about 6 inches longer, 2.7 inches narrower and its wheelbase is 6.1 inches longer than the entry-level combustion Hyundai i10. All of this should translate into more than a decent interior room for the size of the car, but bear in mind that it’s still pretty small by American standards–the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt subcompact EV is almost 10 inches longer while the wheelbase is 1 inch longer.
Two battery powertrain options will be available. The entry-level Inster will come with a 42-kilowatt-hour battery and a 71.1-kilowatt (95-horsepower) electric motor, while the fancier version will get a 49-kWh battery pack and an 84.5-kW (113 hp) motor. The torque figure is 108 pound-feet (147 Newton-meters) for both.
For the base battery pack, Hyundai expects a WLTP range of 186 miles (300 km). With this version, the zero to 62 miles per hour sprint can be achieved in 11.7 seconds, while the top speed is 87 miles per hour (140 kilometers per hour).
Hyundai Inster (2024)
In the case of the Inster with the larger battery, Hyundai targets a WLTP-rated range of 220 miles (355 km), which is 80 miles more than the Dacia Spring is capable of. The power output of the Inster is also almost double compared to the Spring’s maximum 48 kW (64 hp), allowing it to sprint to 62 in 10.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 93 mph (150 kph). The Inster also boasts a battery heating system and a heat pump.
Hyundai said that both battery versions can be topped up from 10% to 80% state of charge in roughly 30 minutes when hooked up to a 120 kW DC fast charger. The company claims the energy consumption is 15.3 kWh/100 km or 4.06 miles/kWh.
The standard onboard AC charger is rated at 11 kW and there’s vehicle-to-load capability built-in, but the company didn’t say what’s the maximum power output.
Hyundai Inster (2024) V2L
As a reminder, the new Inster is not based on the EV-specific E-GMP platform that’s used for larger models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV9. Instead, it uses an ICE platform that has been adapted for an electric powertrain.
On the outside, the new affordable EV comes with digital-pixel LED daytime running lights and rear LED lights as standard. Three wheel options are available, starting with 15-inch steelies with wheel covers as part of the base package, while 15- and 17-inch alloys can be specced for extra cash.
Inside, the Hyundai Inster EV has seating for four, but a five-seater version is coming next year. At the front, the floor is flat and there’s no center console between the seats, allowing the driver to easily scooch to the right and get out of the car through the front passenger’s door if there’s not enough space on the driver’s side.
The rear seats can slide front and rear to increase or decrease the legroom and cargo space. With the seats moved all the way back, the trunk has a volume of 8.4 cubic feet (238 liters). Sliding them all the way forward increases that figure to 12.4 cu ft (351 l) while folding them flat will result in a cargo volume of 37.4 cu ft (1,059 liters).
A pair of 10.25-inch screens–one for the digital instrument cluster and one for the infotainment system–come as standard, as well as a one-touch sunroof, a heated steering wheel, a wireless charging pad for smartphones and a pretty long list of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), including smart cruise control with stop and go, forward collision-avoidance assistance, surround-view monitor, lane-keeping assist and lane-following assist. Wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also available.
The Korean automaker hasn’t released the pricing for the all-new Inster EV. However, we know from previous reports that quoted Hyundai France boss Lionel Keogh, who said that the entry-level battery-powered hatchback would be priced around €20,000, which is roughly $21,500 at current exchange rates, including value-added tax (VAT).",Iulian Dnistran
"Volvo EX30 Delayed In America Until 2025, Production Moving To Belgium",https://insideevs.com/news/724655/volvo-ex30-delayed-china/,Volvo's affordable compact EX30 won't arrive this year after all. Blame the new tariffs on China-built EVs.,2024-06-26 13:11:17,"The compact electric Volvo EX30 won't be coming to the U.S. in 2024 after all.
A Volvo Cars USA spokesperson told InsideEVs today that the EX30's debut has been delayed to 2025 while the automaker moves production to Ghent, Belgium, instead of China, as was originally planned.
""Today Volvo Car USA is informing retailers and EX30 preorder customers that due to changes in the global automotive landscape, the U.S. introduction of the EX30 will be delayed while we ramp up production at our plant in Ghent, Belgium, with a 2025 target delivery date to be announced,"" the spokesperson said.
Volvo is the first to fall to new tariffs
New 100% tariffs on China-made EVs will keep them out of the U.S. market, for now. But most automakers operating in America realize that they'll have to compete with BYD, Geely and others eventually.
The move is a shocking reversal of Volvo's earlier plans to release a smaller and more affordable car than it's ever deployed across global markets, and an electric one at that. Unveiled last year, the EX30 drew immediate attention for its minimalist design, respectable range and, most importantly, a starting price of around $35,000 in the U.S.
Key to that price tag was where the car was built: in China, at factories owned by Geely Group, the parent company of Volvo. Due to various advancements in technology, heavy subsidies and drastically lower labor costs, many of China's EVs are priced considerably lower than their Western competitors.
But fears of cheap Chinese EVs flooding into the U.S. market and undercutting local automakers—a situation that is already playing out in Europe—led the Biden Administration to issue new 100% tariffs on electric cars from that country. While those tariffs are largely keeping Chinese automakers like BYD and Li Auto out of the U.S. for now, they will also affect China-built EVs from brands that operate here, including Volvo and Polestar.
That outcome meant that China-built EX30s likely would've come in at a much higher price than initially announced. A big price increase for such a small vehicle would've made the EX30 a tough sell in the U.S.
The Volvo spokesperson hasn't yet returned a request for more information about how the EX30's move to European production could affect its pricing, or what options and trim levels will be offered in the U.S. market. But it is still definitely coming.
""Importantly, we remain committed to bringing EX30 to the US and are working hard to get it into customer hands,"" the Volvo spokesperson told InsideEVs.
Last year, Volvo announced the EX30 would also be built in Belgium as a way to satisfy anticipated European demand for the car. But even then, Volvo said that wasn't set to begin until 2025; it seems that the U.S. is going to have to wait until then.
As I wrote for InsideEVs earlier this month, Americans who put down a $500 reservation for the EX30 (which, in the interest of full disclosure, included me as well until recently) often faced ""radio silence"" from their dealers when seeking information about the status of their orders. Many reservation-holders became concerned about the car's pricing after the new tariffs were announced. But Volvo says reservation holders won't be left hanging.
""We’ll offer customers with existing preorders several options to drive a new Volvo until their EX30 arrives,"" the spokesperson said via email.
The chairman of Volvo's Retail Advisory Board—a group that coordinates with Volvo on the needs of U.S. dealers—told InsideEVs that Volvo indicated it would sell the car here eventually.
When, and perhaps if, the EX30 does arrive, it will compete against a new crop of more affordable electric models, including the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV and the new Kia EV3. But it now may not be able to match those cars in price, and whatever head start it could've had is now a victim of the tariffs. It's a good reminder that, in the EV era, local production is more important now than ever before.
""The EX30 remains a cornerstone of Volvo Cars’ ongoing strategic transformation and reflects our ambition to build cars where we sell them as much as possible,"" the Volvo spokesperson said.

2025 BMW M5 Has Up To 25 Miles Of Electric Range And A Big Weight Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/724420/2025-bmw-m5-phev-range-weight-specs/,"Despite being more powerful than before, the first-ever plug-in hybrid BMW M5 is slower to 60 mph than its predecessor.",2024-06-25 18:01:00,"The BMW M5, historically one of the best-handling and thrilling sports sedans in the world, has officially gone down the plug-in hybrid route for its seventh generation. Sporting a burbling 4.4-liter V-8 under the hood, an electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission and a 14.8-kilowatt-hour (usable) high-voltage battery, the 2025 BMW M5 boasts an impressive spec sheet and a price tag to match.
Coming to the United States later this year, the brand-new German uber-sedan promises an “unfiltered performance experience,” but we can’t help but notice that even with all the weight savings mentioned in the official press release–like a plastic oil pan, among other things–the 2025 M5 is still a whopping 1,000 pounds heavier than the previous generation.
2025 BMW M5 specs
Tipping the scales at a generous 5,390 pounds, the seventh-gen BMW M5 has a total system output of 717 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque. This makes it 117 hp more powerful and 185 lb-ft more torquey than its predecessor but despite this, the zero to 60 miles per hour time is 3.4 seconds, two-tenths of a second slower than the old one.

More powerful, faster versions of the PHEV M5 will almost certainly take to the streets in the coming years, but as it stands right now, it’s not looking too cool for sports sedan enthusiasts.
Combustion lovers might also be unimpressed with the power output of the V-8 unit sitting under the hood. Making 577 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque without assistance from the electric motor, the S68 lump is 23 hp down on power compared to its predecessor, while the torque figure is the same.
Moving on to more electrifying stuff, that 14.8-kWh battery pack bolted into the floor provides up to 25 miles of all-electric range and can be topped up using a Level 2 charger at a rate of up to 7.4 kW, according to BMW. It can also be charged while driving using the eControl driving mode. Meanwhile, the car defaults to the Hybrid mode every time you start it, giving access to the full system output. Switching to Comfort mode instructs the PHEV system to call on the electric motor more often, while the Electric mode switches off the V-8 completely, as long as there’s enough juice in the battery to propel the car.
Two additional driving modes, Dynamic and Dynamic Plus, come as part of the optional M Drive Professional pack and are aimed at more hardcore driving. When activated, either of the two modes keeps both the combustion engine and electric motor engaged and preconditions the cooling system for track driving. Another optional extra, the M Driver's pack also ups the top speed from the standard 155 mph to 190 mph.
As with the previous generation, the new M5 has an all-wheel drive system called M xDrive that can become a rear-wheel drive setup at the flick of a switch for some tire-shredding fun. The new 2025 BMW M5 also comes with a double-wishbone front suspension and a five-link rear axle, as well as adaptive suspension and four-wheel steering as standard.
Braking is handled by the M Compound setup as standard, which includes 16.1-inch rotors and six-piston calipers at the front and 15.7-inch rotors and single-piston calipers at the rear. As an optional extra, customers can spec the car with the M Carbon ceramic brakes which are around 55 lbs lighter than the standard affair and come with gold calipers and larger 16.5-inch drilled discs at the front.
Compared to the standard 5 Series, the 2025 BMW M5 is 3 inches wider at the front and 1.9 inches at the rear thanks to the wider track and flared wheel arches that were designed specifically for the go-fast 5 Series.
Inside, the high-performance German sedan comes with a long list of standard equipment including a Bowers & Wilkins surround sound system, Sky Lounge panoramic roof, curved dual dashboard display, head-up display, eSIM connectivity and more.
The 2025 BMW M5 will start at $120,675 (including destination) in the United States. Production will begin in July at BMW’s plant in Dingolfing, Germany, with global deliveries slated for November.",Iulian Dnistran
The Electric BMW M3 Will 'Beat Everything',https://www.motor1.com/news/724126/electric-bmw-m3-beat-everything/,BMW M CEO Frank van Meel is eager to take advantage of the sedan's quad-motor setup.,2024-12-25 09:03:16,"While some automakers are changing their EV plans, BMW is marching ahead. The company will launch models using its Neue Klasse platform in a few years, including its high-performance M cars. Those worried about the move to electrification should feel some relief from BMW M CEO Frank van Meel, who claimed that the electric M3 will ""beat everything.""
He told Motor Trend that he is eager to take advantage of the car's quad-motor configuration due to the ability to control the drivetrain and the chassis ""with one central logic,"" creating a ""neutral, linear, and predictable"" performance car that should have the power to, well, beat everything.
BMW Neue Klasse EV Concept
Frank Weber, BMW's head of engineering and R&D, has already hinted at the car making one megawatt of power, or 1,341 horsepower. The M car will feature unique battery chemistry and cooling, in-house designed e-motors, an 800-volt architecture, and special software to run it all.
The automaker is also considering a lighter rear-wheel-drive variant that offers a different driving experience. Half the motors likely mean half the power and 670 hp is still a lot. We might also get an electric M3 Touring riding on the new architecture, but all the fun stuff is still a few years away. The Neue Klasse-based 3 Series arrives in 2026, followed by the M3 in 2027. The wagon would likely come after that, closer to the decade's end.
How much will this super-machine cost? We don't know, but we hope the price doesn't also beat everything we have ever seen. Bold cars backed by bold claims often come with equally bold price tags

2026 Bugatti Tourbillon: This Is It,https://www.motor1.com/news/723757/2026-bugatti-tourbillion-debut-specs/,"It has 16 cylinders, 3 electric motors, and a top speed of 276 miles per hour.",2024-12-25 09:03:17,"This is not another Bugatti Chiron derivative. There's certainly a striking resemblance to the old W-16-powered hypercar, but this a completely new beast. The monocoque is new. The suspension is new. And the hybrid V-16 powertrain is most definitely new. Say hello to Bugatti's next-generation 1,800-horsepower flagship, the Tourbillon.
The previous reports about the engine were true—this is an 8.3-liter monster that revs to 9,500 RPM and makes 1,000 horsepower without any turbochargers. Cosworth helped develop the naturally aspirated beast, which weighs just 555 pounds despite being significantly larger than the W-16 it replaces. There's also 664 pound-feet of torque, but of greater interest here is the other half of the Tourbillon's powertrain.
We're talking about the hybrid assistance. A front e-axle carries two electric motors, with a third motor positioned at the back to help spin the rear wheels. A 25 kWh centrally-mounted battery pack supplies power, adding 800 hp to the mix. The combined output is 1,800 hp, and provided the bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have enough grip, the Tourbillon will reach 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.0 seconds.
But that's not a proper metric to convey the Tourbillon's true performance. Under full throttle, 124 mph is reached in around 5.0 seconds. 186 mph arrives in a mere 10 seconds. The top speed of 236 mph happens in less than 25 seconds, unless you have the special Speed Key installed. When activated, the Tourbillon keeps its ginormous rear wing hunkered down while the speed climbs all the way to 276 mph.
The latest Bugatti doesn't lose anything in becoming a hybrid, except a little bit of weight. Yes, despite a battery pack and electric motors, Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron. It can also cruise around town without using that snazzy V-16 engine. Actually, it can go beyond town with an estimated EV range of 37 miles. There's no mention of speed on electric power, and Bugatti isn't ready to talk about charging times. But it uses an 800-volt system, and lest we forget, Mate Rimac is steering Bugatti these days. And he knows a thing or two about electric performance.
Watch connoisseurs will recognize tourbillon as mechanical bits used in high-quality timepieces to increase accuracy. Bugatti sees its Tourbillon as a big, timeless work of mechanical perfection. That becomes readily apparent when you open the electrically actuated dihedral doors to see the stunning analog interior. Three large dials affixed to the steering wheel display everything from speed to engine revs, fuel quantity, engine temperature, and more. There isn't a screen in sight.
The gauges were designed and crafted by Switch watchmakers, and they're permanently fixed to the steering column so they remain stationary as you turn the wheel. Meanwhile in the center console, you'll find banks of aluminum switches, rotary dials, and a single crystal lever that starts the V-16. The purpose of all this is to give the Tourbillon a timeless look, but there is a hidden digital screen at the top of the center console. On command, it will rotate up and give the driver access to Apple CarPlay, among other things.
As for the design, there's no mistaking it for a Bugatti. The Chiron-esque exterior features a special diffuser that begins just behind the passenger cabin, virtually hidden from view. Vents under the headlights help funnel air to the large side intakes. The horseshoe grille feeds air to radiators while also augmenting downforce. The active rear wing can deploy upward to serve as an airbrake. And it all rides on a completely new multi-link suspension that is 45 percent lighter compared to the Chiron's bones.
""The development of the Bugatti Tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of Bugatti history and the words of Ettore Bugatti himself,"" said Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac. ""His mantras ‘if comparable it is no longer Bugatti’ and ‘nothing is too beautiful’ were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the Bugatti hyper sports car story.""
Though we're seeing the car today, that era won't begin until 2026 when the first of 250 production cars will be delivered. Right now, the Tourbillon is currently in its testing phase, so start saving those pennies. You'll need every single one, because the Tourbillon's starting price is 3.6 million Euros (around $3.9 million at current exchange rates).

Meanwhile, the mid-tier RS E-Tron GT gets a still impressive power output of 845 hp for a 2.8-second sprint to 62 mph, while the entry-level E-Tron GT is good for 671 hp and needs 3.4 seconds to reach 62. Previously, the most powerful model–the 2024 RS E-Tron GT–was rated at 637 hp with boost engaged and could reach 60 mph in 3.1 seconds.
More Performance EVs
As with its also recently updated Porsche cousin, the Taycan, the refreshed Audi E-Tron GT gets a bigger battery and faster charging speeds.
These tweaks enable the curvy cruiser to drive further and stop for less time to recharge. The usable capacity of the lithium-ion battery went up from 84 kilowatt-hours to 97 kilowatt-hours, leading to a maximum WLTP-rated range of 378 miles for the S E-Tron GT trim.
Mind you, the EPA numbers for the refresh aren't yet available, but we know that the outgoing model has a rating of 249 miles on a full charge.
The maximum charging speed was increased from 270 kW to 320 kW, allowing the German EV to gain 174 miles of range in just 10 minutes from a compatible DC fast charger. Audi also managed to slash the weight of the battery pack and the rear electric motor by 20 pounds and 22 pounds, respectively. The maximum brake regen power has also increased from 290 to 400 kW.
The facelifted zero-emissions five-door fastback has a newly developed two-chamber, twin-valve air suspension setup that takes seconds to lower the car’s ride height by 2.1 to 3 inches to maximize comfort over bumps, even on the entry-level S version. At the same time, the range-topping RS E-Tron GT performance (which is quite a mouthful) gets a dedicated performance mode on top.
The changes inside are minimal compared to the outgoing model. Audi said the seats, steering wheel, entry sills, and digital content have been redesigned. The base S E-Tron GT comes with sports seats plus 14-way adjustment as standard, while RS models can be optionally specced with massaging seats and 18-way adjustment.
The digital instrument cluster of the range-topping RS E-Tron GT Performance comes with a white power display and speedometer that pay homage to the 1992 Audi RS2 Avant, which had its analog dials dressed in white. There’s also a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) panoramic roof available as an optional extra that can be dimmed at the push of a button.
Pricing in the U.S. isn’t available yet, but expect to pay well over $130,000 for the entry-level Audi S E-Tron GT when it arrives stateside. In Germany, the car starts at €126,000 ($135,200), while the mid-tier RS E-Tron GT goes for €147,500 ($158,200). The top-trim RS E-Tron GT Performance starts at €160,500 ($172,200).",Iulian Dnistran
Nio EL8 Is A Luxurious Six-Seater Electric SUV For Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/723524/nio-el8-debut-europe/,"It will be available in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.",2024-06-17 10:00:59,"Nio continues its European expansion by unveiling a new large electric SUV aimed at families. The EL8 is Nio’s flagship SUV offering in Europe, and it promises not only oodles of interior space but also advanced safety tech and performance befitting a manufacturer’s top offering. It’s also relatively slippery for a large SUV, with a claimed drag coefficient of 0.25 Cd.
Powering the EL8 is a pair of electric motors: one 241 horsepower permanent-magnet motor drives the front wheels, and a 402 hp induction motor drives the rear wheels. Their combined total output of 643 hp and 627 pound-feet of torque is enough to propel this big SUV to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds. That’s a lot of performance for a heavy SUV, and stopping power is ensured by six-piston front calipers gripping large rotors.
Nio is targeting luxury SUV buyers with the EL8
Nio expects to snag buyers away from established automakers' large electric SUVs with the EL8, which costs nearly €100,000 with the battery pack included.
With the larger 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, Nio says the EL8 should be good for a WLTP range of 317 miles. The EL8 features a 75 kWh battery as standard, which should provide about 250 miles of WLTP range.
With a total length just shy of 5.1 meters, or 201 inches, the EL8 is 24.5 centimeters, or about 10 inches longer than the smaller EL6, enough to gain a third row of seats. It is available in a six-seater configuration with or without a console and a built-in fridge between the second-row seats. All seats are electric as standard and Nio says they can gain new functions via over-the-air updates.
When the third row of seats is up, space in the trunk is limited, but their backrests can be folded electrically, increasing the maximum load volume to 810 liters, or 28.6 cubic feet. With the rear seats down, Nio says you can fit four large suitcases in the back.
The standard wheel size for the EL8 is 20 inches, but you can go up to 21 or 22 inches at an extra cost. Nio promises the vehicle will remain very quiet and comfortable thanks to standard dual-chamber air suspension, active and adaptive dampers and double-glazed windows.
The EL8 features a new 16.3-inch head-up display, 2.5 times larger than what it previously put in its vehicles. It is projected directly onto the windscreen and is complimented by a 12.8-inch portrait-style OLED central display and a smaller 10.2-inch driver’s display. Rear passengers get a 6.6-inch display. The voice-controlled digital assistant Nomi can be summoned from any of the EL8’s six seats, including from the third row.
With lidar and a total of 33 sensors and cameras on the outside, the EL8 can detect obstacles and vehicles up to 680 meters (2,230 feet) away, and it can see pedestrians at a distance of 220 meters (721 feet). Just like a Tesla, the Nio can also record what’s going on around the car when parked and also begin recording automatically in the event of an accident; you can also start recording manually, like on a traditional dash cam, if you witness something in traffic that’s worth saving.
You can get the Nio EL8 in Europe for €82,900 ($88,800) without the battery included (and you have to pay a monthly fee for the battery-as-a-service scheme), or €94,900 ($101,600) if you also want to buy the battery. It’s available in Norway, where Nio has four battery-swapping stations, and in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.",Andrei Nedelea
The New Fiat Grande Panda Proves Fun Designs Aren't Dead,https://www.motor1.com/news/723316/2025-fiat-grande-panda-debut/,It comes with a choice of hybrid or electric power.,2024-12-25 09:03:19,"Although Fiat's European lineup is aging, at least it's significantly more diverse than what we get here in the United States. Aside from the 500 and 500X, there's also the Tipo hatchback and wagon. There are also hot Abarth models, like the 600X crossover, and the cutesy Panda. The latter is now joined by the new Grande Panda, a larger and mechanically different vehicle.
The Grande Panda is an addition to the family rather than a replacement for the current Panda, which will stick around until at least 2027, at which point it will have been 16 years old. As the name of the newcomer implies, it’s much grander than the old car. It’s 157 inches long, making it about 12 inches longer than the third-generation Panda launched all the way back in 2011.
It's still a diminutive car by American standards but considerably more substantial than before. The jump in size is not a real surprise since the boxy crossover is essentially Fiat's version of the new Citroen C3 sold in Europe. It looks a lot funkier than its French connection, sending concept car vibes even though this is a production model.
The cheerful Fiat Grande Panda embraces the pixel motif that might make you think of a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Those front LED daytime running lights have a chequered pattern. It's a recurring theme that you'll also notice inside the taillights. The Italian brand went to town with squares and 90-degree angles, which is refreshing to see in an automotive world dominated by swoopy designs and curvy lines.
Those 17-inch wheels with a diamond-cut design have a central ""X"" to compliment the light signature at the front and rear. Plastic cladding around the wheel arches makes the Grande Panda look more rugged, as do the chunky roof rails. Rather than using an old-fashioned badge at the back, an oversized Fiat script is debossed into the tailgate. The Panda lettering is hiding in plain sight on that black horizontal strip connecting the taillights.
The Grande Panda will be sold with hybrid and electric powertrains, presumably the same ones available for the Citroen C3. Expect a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine with three cylinders, a mild-hybrid setup, and a dual-clutch, six-speed automatic transmission. The gas is good for 100 horsepower while the electric motor provides a temporary boost of 28 hp. However, that e-motor only delivers 12 hp during acceleration.
The fully electric Grande Panda might inherit the 113-hp motor from the e-C3, along with its 44.0-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for a 199-mile range. Citroen also intends to sell a cheaper 124-mile e-C3 from 2025.
The Grande Panda won’t be a Euro-only affair as Fiat wants to sell the new model in the Middle East and Africa as well.

"Jeep's $25,000 EV Will Be The Next Renegade",https://insideevs.com/news/723241/jeepr-renegade-ev-25k-news/,"Jeep has given a name to its upcoming affordable electric car, and it's a familiar one.",2024-06-13 12:58:29,"The entire auto industry is chasing more affordable electric vehicles. They need to move electric power to a new class of buyer, they're freaked out by the incursion of China's advanced EVs and they have tough fuel economy average targets to meet. Even Jeep is no exception. And so today, we got some news about Jeep's upcoming $25,000 electric model, including the fact that it carries a familiar name.
Jeep's new $25,000 EV will be the next Jeep Renegade, according to a presentation at parent company Stellantis' annual Investor Day event. That move brings fully electric power to a compact but still off-road-capable crossover that's been around since 2014, and also currently exists as a 4xe plug-in hybrid in some markets.
The race for a $25,000 EV
Ford, Tesla, Jeep, General Motors and several others are all racing to get out an EV that may start around $25,000. They need to cut costs, get manufacturing scale up and seek a new kind of buyer. Which automaker gets there first is an open question.
Beyond the announcement of the new name, few details were offered today, except to say that Jeep seems to be targeting a 2027 release date for the next Renegade. In the meantime, the automaker has several more plug-in hybrid, fully electric and range-extender models in the pipeline. Like those models, the Renegade is planned for North America.
At the same time, it's worth noting that while Stellantis is often quite thorough in announcing its upcoming product lineup plans, those plans can change. (Anyone remember when Alfa Romeo was supposed to have this monster new lineup of sedans and SUVs?) But these plans do fit with what the automaking giant has been planning over the past few years, which is to offer a wide variety of powertrains—hybrid, gas, electric, PHEV and range-extended EVs—to suit different market needs and conditions.
First up on the electric front will be the new Jeep Wagoneer S, which arrives this fall with a planned 300 miles of range. That car's Launch Edition model is expected to cost a hefty $71,995. But the second half of this decade will be when a number of more affordable EVs are expected to come to market, so if Jeep delivers on the Renegade at around $25,000, it's going to be in good company.

Ford Cancels Model e Dealership Program And Set EV Pricing Model,https://insideevs.com/news/723205/ford-cancels-modele-dealership-program/,The bold attempt to separate EV sales from combustion sales proved too difficult a task to accomplish.,2024-06-13 09:15:36,"Ford announced today that it is sunsetting its Model E dealer certification program, effective July 1. The program was announced on September 14th, 2022, and officially began on Jan. 1 of this year. While the automaker's goal was to better compete with EV startups by requiring dealers to invest in charging stations, training, customer education and no-haggle pricing before they could sell EVs, Ford's dealers went full-throttle in their opposition to it—and even filed lawsuits over the plan.
InsideEVs was on hand when Ford announced the program at its dealership meetings in Las Vegas in 2022. At the time, it told its dealer network they had to invest in EV charging infrastructure, improve customer service, and agree to set EV pricing if they wanted to be a Model e dealership and continue to sell Ford's electric vehicles.
At the time, Ford split the company into three arms: Ford Blue Oval, Ford Pro, and Ford Model e. All of Ford's fully electric vehicles fell under the Model e umbrella, while plug-in hybrids and regular hybrids are part of Ford Blue Oval.
Ford dealers would be unable to sell fully electric vehicles unless they agreed to one of the two certification levels.
That's no longer the case. All Ford dealerships can sell electric vehicles beginning July 1.
Ford Lightning Pro
Ford gave its dealers until Oct. 31, 2022, less than two months after the announcement, to make a decision that would have huge implications for the franchise's future.
That deadline was extended to Dec. 2, as many dealers complained that six weeks wasn't enough time for such a major decision. The company offered its dealers three options:
Of the 1,920 franchises that agreed to become Model e dealers, initially, 1,659 chose to be Certified Elite with full sales and service capability. Another 261 dealers chose to be Certified with full-service capability, limited sales, and a lower investment cost.
Related News
I was told today that about 1,500 dealers are Model e-certified dealerships, so about 400 of the initial hand-raisers decided against the Model e business model.
Dealers that opted out entirely would have the opportunity to tell Ford they wanted to be a Model e certified dealer in 2025, and start selling EVs on Jan. 1, 2027, after three years without getting any electric vehicles to sell.
Ford Mustang Mach-E Green
Model e Certified Elite dealers were required to install two high-powered DC fast chargers, one level 2 charging station, and one DC fast charger had to be made available for public use.
Model e Certified dealers were only required to install one DC fast charger, which had to be available for the public. Initially, Certified dealers had a hard cap on the number of EVs they were allowed to sell each year, but Ford later removed that cap under intense pushback from its dealers.
Model e dealers were also required to post set prices for electric vehicles online on Ford's main website, not the dealer's website. Customers could then view the set pricing, complete the purchase online, and even schedule home delivery. However, the dealerships set the prices, not Ford, so there would likely be price variation from dealer to dealer.
Customers could then cross-shop different local dealers' prices online and choose the one with the lowest set price. The dealers had to honor the set pricing for every purchase, and Ford said it would be checking the purchase orders to ensure the set pricing was honored.
The dealers also had to undergo special training and offer service, including a drop-off/pick-up service.
2024 Ford F-150 Lightning Flash
With today's announcement, the entire program is scrapped, or ""sunsetted"" as Ford put it. It's unfortunate, because ultimately the program would have made Ford dealerships better, and set Ford up to be more competitive as the industry transitions to electric.
I asked Marin Gjaja, COO of Ford Model e, if the decision to end the program only six months after it officially began was because of the intense pushback and lawsuits from dealership associations across the country. I was told that wasn't the case, but it's hard to believe that didn't play a major role in the decision to pull the plug.
I can't help but see this as a major missed opportunity for Ford and its dealers. Consumers aren't happy with the current dealership model, and Ford was trying to improve that while toeing the line of the archaic but strong dealership laws in the U.S.
Everyone loses here. The dealers may think they won, but they didn't. Short-term gains will be overwhelmed by long-term losses as consumers look to EV startups that work around the dealership laws and offer a set pricing model. That will eventually erode Ford's EV market share as consumers seek a better purchasing experience and the security of knowing they can pull into any Ford dealership and charge up when needed.",Tom Moloughney
Subaru Explains How Its New Hybrid Boxer Engine is Better,https://www.motor1.com/news/722335/subaru-details-new-hybrid-engine/,Production of the next-gen hybrid powertrain starts this fall.,2024-12-25 09:03:21,"Some automakers are trying to save the manuals while others are attempting to rescue the internal combustion engine. Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru held a joint conference to explain how decarbonization can be achieved without going all-in on EVs. Toyota has three new smaller and more efficient engines in the works. Mazda is pursuing single- and two-rotor engines. Here's what Subaru is cooking up.
It has figured out how to keep its horizontally opposed engine alive in a next-generation hybrid system. During the conference, the company showed a prototype of its electrified boxer inside a camouflaged Crosstrek prototype. The outgoing setup relies on a parallel system where the engine and motor both power the vehicle. The new series-parallel layout will maintain a mechanical connection between the ICE and the wheels but the combustion engine will also serve as a generator to feed a battery that powers an electric motor.
Next-generation Subaru hybrid boxer engine
Subaru argues the new hardware brings notable benefits not just in terms of fuel economy but also in packaging. The engine, hybrid system, transmission, and transfer case are all housed together while the power control unit is located in the engine bay, without negatively impacting the size of the fuel tank. That allows the engineers to install bigger gas tanks to achieve a longer range.
In the old Crosstrek hybrid, the power control unit was mounted at the rear, so the fuel tank had to be downsized to make room for it. Thanks to the new arrangement, Subaru claims the fuel tank's size will be almost the same in the hybrid as in the regular gas-only model. Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Fujinuki touts a ""very long cruising distance."" During his speech, he said the new system must solve the ""current weakness in fuel efficiency.""
The company's CTO admits that if fuel economy is the ultimate goal, the boxer engine might not represent the ideal solution:
""If you were just going for efficiency, horizontally opposed engines are not necessarily always the best option. But what would Subaru be without them? When you think about it, we are the only mass-market brand making horizontally opposed engines today.""
Toyota also uses a boxer engine but only in the GR86 sports car, which is a sister model of the Subaru BRZ. Porsche has flat-four and flat-six engines but it's far from being a mainstream brand given how much their cars cost.
Subaru plans to start production of its next-gen hybrid boxer engine this fall at a factory in Kitamoto, Saitama at home in Japan. As you can imagine, the hardware is being conceived for all-wheel-drive applications.
Subaru High Performance X Future Concept
In related news, the company is working together with Toyota and Mazda on carbon-neutral fuels. To that end, it'll enter a WRX-based High Performance X Future Concept in the Super Taikyu racing series.
Since we mentioned Mazda earlier, the Zoom-Zoom company is doing things differently with the revival of its rotary. In the MX-30 small crossover, the engine doesn't actually send power to the wheels. Instead, the sole purpose of the transversely mounted rotary is to act as a generator to juice up a battery. An electric motor uses the harvested energy to drive the wheels.
Mazda is already working on a different layout for a longitudinally mounted two-rotor engine that could go into a new sports car, potentially an RX7 reboot it's ""considering.""

"2025 Rivian R1S And R1T Get Up To 420 Miles Of Range, Huge Changes Under The Skin",https://insideevs.com/news/722131/second-gen-rivian-r1-debut/,"Rivian's R1 twins may look the same, but a ton is new here—including a new tri-motor version and upgraded software all around.",2024-06-06 12:00:00,"Rivian has grand plans to introduce affordable electric models next, including the R2 crossover and the R3 and R3X hatchbacks. But neither will arrive anytime soon; the R2 is not slated for release until 2026, with the R3 models expected to launch even later. In the meantime, Rivian will rely on updated versions of its original EVs, the R1T and R1S, as it works on making its future models a reality. And the big news is what's under the skin.
The second-gen Rivian R1 EVs look the same and still have the funky retro-modern vibe. But underneath there's a new electrical architecture and software platform, in-house-built drive units, and an LFP battery pack for the base version. The changes are intended to ease production challenges and reduce losses per vehicle.
And if electrical architectures and ""compute power"" don't interest you, maybe the four-motor variant getting about 200 more horsepower will instead.
Rivian R1 EVs enter a new generation.
Two years after Rivian's electric truck and SUV entered the market, the automaker has given them a thorough upgrade. Rivian lost just over $38,000 behind every EV in Q1 2024, down from $68,000 a year ago. Now, it hopes to narrow the losses further with the upgraded EVs that use simpler electrical architectures and are easier to manufacture and repair.
Rivian started moving away from the Bosch quad-motors last year to focus on its in-house Enduro drive units to improve production speed and efficiency. The second-generation R1T and R1S models will complete that transition.
The base versions will continue with the dual motor set-up, but Rivian also offers an all-new tri-motor version now. Previously, the R1 series models only came with two or four motors.
The tri-motor version gets two motors at the rear and one in the front, with a combined output of 850 horsepower, enough to propel the R1T from a standstill to 60 mph in a blistering 2.9 seconds.
The manufacturer-estimated range is about 380 miles on the tri-motor R1T using the 149 kWh Max battery pack. That can stretch up to 410 miles in Conserve mode.
Not to be outdone, the top quad motor R1 models get a performance boost, with output increasing from 835 hp and 908 pound-feet of torque to 1,025 hp and 1,198 lb-ft. That’s enough for the R1T to slingshot from 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds in Launch mode, a tenth quicker than the braggadocious Tesla Cybertruck.
Rivian claims the front two motors in the quad-motor version are compact, efficiency-focused units whereas the rear motors are engineered for performance.
The entry-level models now use lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery packs, good for 270 miles of range, the same as before. Rivian hasn’t released the exact battery capacity, but leaked certification documents shared on Rivian Forums suggest the size of the Standard pack has decreased from 105.9 kWh to 92.5 kWh.
If the battery size has decreased but the range is the same as the outgoing NMC units, then that’s saying something about how far LFP batteries have come. Typically, they aren’t as energy-dense as NMC units, but are cheaper and have a longer lifespan. That makes them suitable for entry-level models—the standard-range Tesla Model 3 and Model Y also use LFP batteries globally.
The Large and Max packs continue to use the same 2170 cylindrical cells. But the pack enclosures are now made from large high-pressure die castings to simplify manufacturing and reduce mass, according to Rivian. All that is in the interest of simpler assembly and easier serviceability.
Rivian says they deliver up to 330 miles (Large) and 420 miles (Max) of estimated range, respectively. So that would put the dual motor R1T with the Max pack between the Tesla Cybertruck AWD (340 miles) and the Chevy Silverado EV (440 miles). The dual motor R1S with the Max pack will continue to get 410 miles of range.
The tri-motor and quad-motor versions can only be had with the Max pack, Rivian confirmed to InsideEVs. On the outgoing models, the Standard+ had 121 kWh of capacity. The Large pack offered 135 kWh, while the Max battery was rated for 149 kWh.
Early R1Ts had teething issues related to software and maintenance. Owners complained about glitches on the screen, and malfunctioning driver assistance features and one owner even told InsideEVs that Rivian had to replace his R1T’s entire wiring harness just to replace a single side-view camera.
Rivian claims to have multiple fixes for such issues. There’s a new zonal electrical architecture that uses fewer more powerful ECUs, down from 17 to just seven on the second-gen models. Rivian says this has helped it remove some 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle and reduce 44 pounds of weight.
The Rivian R1T has 11 external cameras. But several Rivian owners seemed unhappy with their quality, and how they process the footage of the surroundings into the screen. The new cameras are 4K HDR units and can see three times farther and 10 seconds ahead at highway speeds.
Rivian claims these are the highest-megapixel cameras of any vehicle sold in North America—we’ll find out how they fare in the real world when we spend some time with the new models.
The second-gen R1S and R1T also feature dual Nvidia Drive Orin processors that deliver 10 times the computing performance compared to the outgoing system. The AI-powered processors use the same architectural elements as large language models (LLMs), christened “Vision Transformers” to decipher the environment around the EV and prepare reactions.
A wave of next-gen EVs, mainly Chinese, use these processors for their flagship EVs. BYD, Xpeng, Li Auto and even Lucid are using Nvidia Drive Orin as their centralized car computers as they prepare for higher levels of autonomous driving capabilities—something Nvidia claims these chips are designed for.
Rivian also says the infotainment system has been ""completely redeveloped,"" and that many of the changes to its user interface will be rolled out to first-generation R1 vehicles via an over-the-air update.
There are tons of little tweaks on the software front, including a cool addition to how the drive modes look: cel shading. This mimics the style of hand-drawn animation, with bold outlines and limited shading to create a stylized look—making them look less realistic and more cartoony. It’s something we see more commonly in video games, and as computers become more powerful, these art styles are coming back into vogue.
The more powerful chips and the fresh camera hardware should improve the performance of Rivian's suite of advanced driver assistance and safety systems. Features like Highway Assist, which can auto steer, brake and accelerate on select highways will continue to be offered on first and second-gen models.
Second-generation models will be available with a premium version of the same, called Autonomy Platform+. That will pack a broader set of skills, including Lane Change on Command (due late Summer via OTA update) and Enhanced Driver Assist that slated to arrive later this year.
Rivian also added that its EVs will continue to use a set of five radars to detect the environment around them. ""These radars serve as a vital backup to the cameras, particularly in situations where dirt or grime could obscure a camera lens,"" the automaker said.
The refreshed R1S starts at $75,900 and the R1T starts at $69,900, before taxes and fees. These are the dual-motor, Standard pack versions available to order immediately. The tri-motor R1S starts at $105,900 whereas the R1T is priced at $99,900.
They are expected to arrive by late summer whereas quad-motor is said to follow sometime later. We don’t know the prices of the quad-motor versions yet but expect detailed pricing in due course. Deliveries of the R1S start on June 7, and R1T will follow soon after.

Nissan Has Stopped Spending Money On New Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/721845/nissan-stops-combustion-engine-investments/,It's going all-in on EVs.,2024-12-25 09:03:22,"Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru recently announced that they're joining forces to develop next-generation combustion engines. However, another Japanese automaker has taken a radically different approach by deciding to stop investing in gasoline and diesel power altogether. Nissan says it's pretty much done spending cash on new ICE technology.
Australian magazine Drive chatted with the company's Senior Vice-President and Chief Planning Officer for the Africa, Middle East, India, Europe, and Oceania (AMIEO) region about what lies ahead. Francois Bailly was asked whether Nissan intends to develop new combustion engines: ""Our future is EV. We're not investing in new powertrain for ICE, that's for sure.""
He mentioned that the transition from conventional powered cars to fully electric models will be done through Nissan's e-Power technology. It's an unconventional hybrid setup where the combustion engine acts as a generator to charge the battery. It doesn't drive the wheels, so it's similar to Mazda's rotary in the MX-30 crossover and the two-rotor setup in the Iconic SP concept.
To maximize fuel economy in these hybrid cars, Nissan wants to boost the thermal efficiency of a combustion engine to an impressive 50 percent. It's been working on the tech for several years, announcing in early 2021 that a prototype e-Power achieved the milestone during testing. It's worth noting that Toyota's Dynamic Force lineup of three-, four-, and six-cylinder engines has already surpassed 40 percent.
Just because Nissan is no longer pouring money into all-new engines, it doesn't mean the switch to an EV-only lineup will happen overnight. Bailley pointed out that emissions regulations continue to be relaxed in some parts of the world, such as in Africa where Euro 2 cars are still legal. The automaker will align its portfolio to regional requirements, so the ICE's demise will be gradual. Current engines are likely to be updated to meet stricter regulations.
Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru believe the internal combustion engine can be saved by making it run on nearly carbon-neutral fuels. The world's largest car manufacturer is working on three inline-fours while the Zoom-Zoom brand has set up a dedicated rotary team. As for Subie, it's preparing a new hybrid setup based around its signature boxer engine. Honda wants to go purely electric in all main markets (including North America) as early as 2040.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Pikes Peak Car Gets 678 HP and Even Louder Exterior Speakers,https://www.motor1.com/news/721723/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-pikes-peak-car/,"A new Time Attack version has more power, more aero, and a lot more sound.",2024-12-25 09:03:22,"Hyundai will head to this year's Pike Peak hill climb with four Ioniq 5 Ns. Two of them will be very close to showroom stock, as revealed by Hyundai back in April. The South Korean brand announced Friday it will additionally campaign two upgraded models in hopes of capturing the modified electric SUV/Crossover record. Say hello to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Time Attack Spec.
Visually speaking, the differences between a standard Ioniq 5 N are obvious. Hyundai adds an aggressive aero kit that includes a gigantic spoiler, side sills, and fender flares. You'll find 18-inch forged wheels with Yokohama slicks under the arches, backed by six-piston brakes for the front and four-piston clamps at the rear. The suspension is upgraded with three-way adjustable dampers. Ride height and camber are also adjustable.
There's a bit more power, too. Hyundai retuned the EV powertrain to get an additional 37 horsepower from the rear motor in full overboost mode. That gives the TA Spec a total of 678 hp, but the components are still production items found in the standard Ioniq 5 N. As such, we pinged Hyundai to ask about a possible production version of the TA Spec. We've yet to hear back, but we will update the post if more news is available.
All Hyundai Ioniq 5s at Pike Peak wear a special wrap and get the necessary safety equipment to participate. That includes upgraded external speakers capable of producing 120 decibels of sound, emitting tones produced through Hyundai's N Active Sound+ system. Aside from the safety requirement of EVs emitting sound while racing, Hyundai states the engine sound will enhance driver feedback.
In addition to the race-prepped models. Hyundai will campaign two production-spec Ioniq 5 Ns with an eye on getting a production EV record. The only changes from stock are safety-related with roll cages and gear necessary to compete. And for the gamers out there, Hyundai is working with the Gran Turismo franchise on upcoming hill climb action in GT7. More details on that endeavor will come later.
“We are investing in the future of motorsport with our first ever electric Pikes Peak racer and collaboration with Gran Turismo,"" said Till Wartenberg, vice president and head of N Brand at Hyundai. ""Motorsport passion continues to be at Hyundai N’s core as we move into the future.""

2024 Jeep Wagoneer S: A 300-Mile EV With Tons Of Speed,https://insideevs.com/news/721484/2024-jeep-wagoneer-s-debut-specs-battery-charging-official/,"Jeep's first global EV launches with a big battery, off-road tricks, an aerodynamic design and quicker 0-60 mph times than a Trackhawk.",2024-05-30 19:00:51,"Technically, the first all-electric Jeep model was the Jeep Avenger. But as a subcompact crossover that only recently added all-wheel-drive, there's a reason it's only sold in Europe and a few other markets. No, the ""real"" battery-powered Jeep that Americans—and soon, much of the rest of the world—will want is this: the 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S.
Set to be assembled in Mexico, the Wagoneer S will first go on sale in the U.S. and Canada this fall, followed by other markets worldwide. The first version available, called Launch Edition, comes with all the bells and whistles and carries a starting price of $71,995 including destination.
Powered by a 100.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack and packing 20-inch wheels, 45 inches of usable screen real estate inside and plenty of ambient lighting, the Launch Edition is as loaded as this model gets. But more affordable variants are coming soon, as are more electric members of the Jeep family as well.
Jeep's EV offensive starts
The Wagoneer S is Jeep's first global EV. Featuring 600 horsepower, dual-motor all-wheel drive and an estimated range of over 300 miles thanks to a massive 100.5-kWh battery, the Wagoneer S looks like a very promising vehicle. That said, the $70,000+ price tag for the Launch Edition makes it $20,000 more expensive than the top-spec Tesla Model Y Performance, so dealers will need to do a lot of convincing work to sell high volumes.
By comparison, a top-spec Tesla Model Y Performance—something the Wagoneer S is already racing against in new ads—is roughly $20,000 less. But Jeep says the all-new Wagoneer S is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit both when purchasing and leasing and more affordable post-Launch Edition versions are likely to follow.
Size-wise, it's also quite a bit bigger than the Model Y. Measuring 192.4 inches long, 74.8 inches wide (without mirrors) and 64.8 inches tall, the Wagoneer S is roughly similar to the Chevrolet Blazer EV, albeit a bit wider. But this isn't just some midsize crossover; it's a Jeep, so it comes standard with dual-motor all-wheel drive.
More Jeep Stories
Billed as Jeep’s most aerodynamic car ever, with a drag coefficient of 0.29, the all-new Wagoneer S is based on Stellantis’ STLA Large platform and uses a 400-volt architecture. Each of the two electric drive motors fitted on the front and rear axles integrate the electric motor, gearing and power electronics into a single unit. Each motor makes 250 kW (335 horsepower), while the total system output is rated at 447 kW (600 hp) and 617 pound-feet of torque.
The front EDM features wheel disconnects to reduce energy consumption when cruising and optimize range. In other words, the Wagoneer S can sometimes run as a rear-wheel drive vehicle.
Jeep says the zero to 60 miles per hour time of the Wagoneer S Launch Edition is 3.4 seconds and the top speed is 124 mph, making it the fastest Jeep ever. Yes, even faster than the Jeep Trackhawk, which could only manage to do it in 3.5 seconds.
Charging the new EV from 5% to 80% from a Level 2 charger takes approximately 6.8 hours, according to Jeep, and the Launch Edition will come with either a 48-amp Level 2 home charger or public charging credits through Free2move Charge, Stellantis’ charging ecosystem.
The maximum DC fast charging rate hasn’t been disclosed, but the company said that a 20% to 80% top-up will take around 23 minutes, adding 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. The official press release didn’t mention anything about vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability, so it’s unclear if Jeep’s new global electric SUV will offer this functionality. The CCS port is located on the rear left quarter panel; Jeep officials said today that they will offer Tesla's NACS port on this model sometime in the next two years.
Jeep’s EV has a curb weight of 5,667 pounds and a payload capacity of 1,033 pounds, while the maximum trailering capacity is 3,400 pounds. The trunk has a volume of 30.6 cubic feet and the front trunk can carry three cubic feet of stuff, while the whole vehicle boasts 61 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down.
The American carmaker says the Wagoneer S has a body torsion stiffness 35% higher than the company’s previous mid-size crossover, which translates to a “superior ride, handling and effective response to driver input.”
And as a Jeep, it shouldn't be a slouch off-road, either. The Wagoneer S boasts five driving modes for different types of terrain, including snow and sand.
Billed as a stylish, sophisticated and confident machine, the new battery-powered Jeep features a stylized closed seven-slot grille that illuminates the line of sight when the driver approaches the car.
The angled hood and windshield help with the EV’s aerodynamics, as do the cantilevered rear spoiler, flush pocket door handles, integrated fins and underbody shields.
The Launch Edition comes with dark accent cues all around the exterior, including 20-inch Gloss Black wheels. There’s also a dual-pane panoramic sunroof and satin-painted accent trims.
Step inside and the biggest attraction is the massive screen real estate. Jeep says the 2024 Wagoneer S has over 45 inches of usable screen space that comes from four separate displays: a 12.3-inch instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch center infotainment system running the company’s Uconnect 5 system, a 10.25-inch segment-exclusive passenger display and another touchscreen at the bottom of the center console for the climate control system. There’s no display for the rear passengers.
The seating, center console, doors and instrument panel are covered in a non-leather synthetic material. The headliner is made from premium microfiber suede and the premium carpets are comprised of recycled pre- and post-consumer materials.
Up front, the Wagoneer S’s cockpit is adorned with black ceramic-coated aluminum with haptic applique. The soft-wrapped doors are accentuated with decorative trim and the flat-bottomed steering wheel is covered in a red-stitched Cabo vinyl anti-microbial material that makes it easier to clean, according to Jeep.
Jeep says it's the only model in its segment to have standard heated and exclusive standard ventilated rear seats. The front seats are also heated and ventilated.
The Launch Edition comes with a segment-exclusive McIntosh premium sound system that packs 19 speakers, a 1,200-watt amplifier and a 12-inch subwoofer. The Wagoneer S also features over-the-air software updates and over 170 safety and security features, according to Jeep, including Active Driving Assist, Intersection Collision Assist, Drowsy Driver Detection, Traffic Sign Recognition and Surround View camera.

2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Trailhawk Concept: Rock-Crawling Goes Electric,https://insideevs.com/news/721595/jeep-wagoneer-s-trailhawk-concept/,Jeep's new midsize electric SUV is probably getting an off-road variant soon.,2024-05-30 19:00:07,"Clearly, Jeep isn't about to let Rivian have all of the fun when it comes to no-gas adventures away from the pavement. Meet the Jeep Wagoneer S Trailhawk Concept, unveiled today in New York City (where the potholes often necessitate an off-road suspension) alongside the standard Wagoneer S. And while Jeep is just calling it a concept for now, it seems almost assuredly destined for production.
After all, this makes sense. With off-roading being such a key part of Jeep's DNA, from the Rubicon Trail to Moab and beyond, leaving its first global all-electric vehicle without a dedicated go-anywhere version would almost feel like an oversight.
As a result, the Wagoneer S Trailhawk—if it's put into production—will add 31.5-inch all-terrain tires, heavy-duty tow hooks, air extractors, an interior with more rugged touches and a lot of exterior tweaks to show that this won't be just another mall-cruiser.
""Not too long after we completed the Jeep Wagoneer S the same designers sketching 'what if', and 'what if' is pretty easy when you're Jeep,"" said Ralph Gilles, the Chief Design Officer of Stellantis. ""You take all those formulas that we know very well that make a Jeep, a Jeep.""
Presumably, the Trailhawk is powered by the same 100.5-kWh battery pack as the normal Wagoneer S, though I have no doubt those big tires and roof rack will cut into the EV's impressive 300 miles of range. But this version may trade some of that for a dedicated Rock mode and a driver-selectable electronic rear axle locker. It has a lifted suspension good for adding three inches of ground clearance, and the front fascia was also redesigned for a better approach angle. ""We think with those changes, it's going to give it some incredible performance,"" Gilles said.
No other specs were released about the Trailhawk version today, but Gilles left it as a kind of open question to the crowd and the wider Jeep fandom as to whether it should be greenlit or not.
""I think we want to make this car,"" he said. ""So we want to hear what you think after this."" Should Jeep go for it? Let us know in the comments.

"$25,000 Electric Jeep Is Coming Soon, Says Stellantis CEO",https://insideevs.com/news/721531/cheap-jeep-ev-coming-soon/,A cheap Jeep that's electric? Consider us intrigued.,2024-05-30 10:00:20,"Stellantis might have been slow to adopt EVs in the U.S., with the new Fiat 500e being sold here about four years after it was first shown. In Europe, however, the brand-heavy automaker is an electric leader thanks to a wide EV lineup from brands such as Peugeot, Citroen, and DS. Now, its North American lineup could soon benefit from that—in the form of a Jeep.
According to CNBC, the U.S. “will have a $25,000 Jeep very soon,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said Wednesday at a Bernstein investor conference. Tavares sees 20,000 euros, or about $25,000 USD, as the target price for an entry-level EV that could be more widely adopted than a luxury model.
That viewpoint follows the Jeep Wagoneer S, which will be revealed Thursday evening and has a target range of more than 300 miles and 600 horsepower.
An inexpensive Jeep EV could have a lot in common with the recently launched Citroen e-C3, an all-electric five-door about the size of the last Honda Fit to be sold in the U.S. It uses a 111 horsepower, 44 kWh electric motor and has a roughly 200-mile range based on WLTP, equating to somewhere between 175 and 180 miles for an EPA estimate. Such a vehicle would likely be a jumping-off point for a Jeep that would unlikely traverse anything more than a muddy parking lot.

The Jeep Avenger is another EV not sold in the U.S., and Stellantis still isn’t expected to offer that small SUV here anytime soon. The Poland-assembled model uses a platform not shared with any model sold in the U.S. or Canada and could be more expensive than potential rivals.
While Stellantis has a growing roster of plug-in hybrids, including the popular Jeep Wrangler 4xe, it’s been mostly mum on its EV plans apart from the trio of upcoming electric Jeeps like the Wrangler S. It turned out to be an advantage with direct rivals Ford and General Motors scrambling to alter product plans and add PHEVs amid lagging public charging infrastructure and new car cost concerns. Even the 149-mile Fiat 500e, by the company’s admission, is a niche product and not the start of a big push for Stellantis BEVs in the U.S.
A $25,000 Jeep EV in the U.S. could make significant waves as sub-$40,000 EVs dwindle and popular, inexpensive models like the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf take a leave of absence. Still, Stellantis continues to lean pretty hard on the Jeep brand globally. Would an inexpensive EV fit a brand like Fiat or Dodge better?
There’s probably still time to figure that out.",Zac Estrada
"Fiat Reverses Course, Puts Gas Engine Back Into 500",https://www.motor1.com/news/721323/fiat-500-gas-engine-2026/,The latest 500 is purely electric but Fiat will install a combustion engine from 2026.,2024-12-25 09:03:25,"The rumors were true. Fiat has confirmed the latest 500 will get a combustion engine after all. Despite being launched strictly as an electric city car with no word of an ICE variant, the hatchback will get gasoline power. Parent company Stellantis has announced a hybrid 500 will be made at the Mirafiori factory in Italy beginning in 2026.
To be fair, the 500 technically never lost its combustion engine; Fiat still sells the previous-generation model outside the United States as a hybrid. In North America, the pint-sized car is strictly electric. It's too soon to say whether the ICE model will make its way to the US where it would definitely be cheaper than the pricey EV. The 2024 500e costs $34,095 before options.
It's obvious that the EV market's cooldown is forcing automakers to alter plans. Many assumed electric vehicles would replace ICE models sooner or later, but with EV incentives being gradually reduced and even eliminated in some cases, people are reconsidering their options.
With the new 500 getting a gas engine, it'll be interesting to see whether the high-performance Abarth 500e will also be joined by a hybrid model. As with the Fiat-badged, previous-generation model, Abarth still sells the sporty 500 with a conventional engine.
Several years ago, Fiat announced it would go purely electric by the end of the decade. However, it's unclear whether that's still happening. Other brands have also pushed back their EV-only ambitions beyond 2030, with the most recent example being Ford of Europe.
In related news, Stellantis also intends to build a hybrid version of the Jeep Compass at the Melfi plant in Italy. No further details were released but we're hoping it'll be based on the third-generation model. The current crossover has been around since 2016, so it's getting a bit long in the tooth.
Speaking of old cars sticking around, the Italian automaker isn't ruling out selling the Panda until 2029, at which point it will have been 18 years old. It would peacefully coexist with the next-gen model slated to debut on July 11 to mark 125 years of Fiat.

"2025 Cadillac Optiq Has 300 Miles Of Range And Starts At $54,000",https://insideevs.com/news/721166/2025-cadillac-optiq-range-specs-official/,"Cadillac’s most affordable EV comes with plenty of standard features, including all-wheel drive and Super Cruise.",2024-05-29 12:00:00,"The 2025 Cadillac Optiq is finally here as the American luxury automaker’s new entry-level all-electric crossover. It will go into production this fall, and when it reaches dealerships toward the end of the year, it will have an estimated starting price of $54,000, including destination.
The Optiq is the Lyriq’s smaller brother. It is based on the same BEV3 architecture that underpins the new Chevrolet Equinox EV. It seats five and comes with a healthy list of standard features.
GM's Ultium plans gain steam
After several delays, General Motors' plan to electrify its range using the Ultium platform is finally heading in the right direction. Following several launches of cars that cost well over $70,000, the Ultium tech is trickling down to more affordable models.
In the United States, Cadillac's new electric crossover has a dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain that makes 300 horsepower (224 kilowatts) and 354 pound-feet of torque. The only battery available is an 85-kilowatt-hour unit that packs 10 lithium-ion modules, enabling a General Motors-estimated driving range of 300 miles on a full charge. The EPA rating is not yet available.
More Cadillac Stories
When plugged into a 7.7 kW AC source, the Optiq’s range increases at 24 miles per hour. From an 11.5 kW AC source, that figure goes up to 33 miles per hour, while the optional 19.2 kW AC charger can add up to 55 miles of range per hour.
A DC fast charger adds up to 79 miles of range in 10 minutes to the Optiq, which can accept a maximum of 150 kW from a compatible stall. The mechanically similar Chevrolet Equinox EV can also take up to 150 kW, while the larger Cadillac Lyriq ups that figure to 190 kW.
The new Optiq will be equipped from the factory with a CCS1 charging port, and not Tesla's NACS connector. Last year, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the company’s first EV with a NACS plug would come in 2025, while access to the Supercharger network for CCS1-equipped vehicles would be enabled this spring.
The Optiq’s specs are a bit better than those of the Chinese-spec model revealed earlier this year. However, the 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time and top speed haven’t been disclosed.
Slated to be a global model–that means Europe will also get it–the new Cadillac Optiq comes as standard with three years of free Super Cruise in the U.S. That’s GM’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) that can automatically steer and change lanes on hundreds of thousands of mapped highway miles in North America.
The EV also offers Regen On Demand, which increases or decreases the force of the regenerative braking feature through a dedicated, pressure-sensitive paddle on the steering wheel. With it, the driver can slow down or stop the car without touching the brake pedal. That said, the Optiq also has a one-pedal driving feature.
2025 Cadillac Optiq interior
Measuring 190 inches long, 84 inches wide and 65 inches tall, Cadillac’s new battery-powered crossover boasts a best-in-class cargo capacity. With the second row up, the trunk has a volume of 26 cubic feet, which increases to 57 cubic feet with the second row down. According to Cadillac, the wheelbase is 116 inches–6 inches shorter than the Lyriq–enabling a segment-best second-row spaciousness. The trailering capacity is 1,500 pounds.
The entry-level luxury EV has a huge, 33-inch diagonal LED display with a 9K resolution that acts as the digital instrument cluster and infotainment screen. Adaptive cruise control, blind zone steering assist, enhanced automatic parking, forward collision alert and a 19-speaker AKG audio system with Dolby Atmos are also part of the standard pack. Google Maps and Google Assistant are baked into the infotainment system.
The car’s pattern accent fabric is woven from yarn made from 100% recycled materials, while the so-called PaperWood veneer is equal parts tulip wood and recycled newspaper.

Volkswagen And Renault Won't Build An Affordable EV Together,https://www.motor1.com/news/720684/renault-volkswagen-failed-ev-collaboration/,"The Twingo is still happening, just not with VW's help.",2024-12-25 09:03:26,"Facing an influx of cheap electric cars from China, European automakers have legitimate reasons to worry. Renault wanted to create an alliance with Volkswagen to better compete with imports but to no avail. A jointly developed EV with a low starting price is not happening. Speaking with Reuters, Renault CEO Luca de Meo said the talks between the two parties have ended.
The French company's head honcho calls it a ""lost opportunity,"" but he suggests that Renault is still open to collaborating with other car manufacturers: ""There may be others."" VW refused to comment, but the two major automakers have officially parted ways. Meanwhile, Renault is riding solo and still aims to have the next-gen Twingo on sale in 2026.
It's worth noting the old Twingo is still around, both with combustion engines and as an EV. The all-new city car will come exclusively in zero-emission guise and undercut the Renault 5, which is kicking off from about €25,000 ($27,000) before incentives. The new Twingo is projected to cost less than €20,000 ($21,600).
It's unclear what VW plans now that it's no longer negotiating with Renault. The Wolfsburg company could use an entry-level EV that would undercut the ID.3 and act as a replacement for the e-up! Something along the lines of an ID.1. VW technical development boss Kai Grunitz has already suggested it would be priced at under €20,000 ($21,600). He projected it would go on sale around 2027.
The battle in the entry-level EV segment is heating up, not just because of Chinese cars flooding Europe. The Dacia Spring is a roaring success, albeit that one too is technically a Chinese car. A better example is the Citroën e-C3, which costs €23,300 and is getting a base version with a lower driving range for €19,990.
In the United States, automakers largely focus on crossovers for their EV ambitions. There's the Fiat 500e and Nissan Leaf on the affordable non-SUV side, with a new Chevrolet Bolt coming next year. The new electric Mini 3-Door could also come to America as well later this decade, but only after production starts in Oxford in 2026.

The Jeep Avenger 4xe Gets Four-Wheel Drive and Lifted Suspension,https://www.motor1.com/news/720543/jeep-avenger-4xe-debut-specs/,The Jeep you can't have in the US finally has what all Jeeps should: Four-wheel drive.,2024-12-25 09:03:26,"It's strange to talk about a Jeep model not sold in the United States. The Avenger, a small Euro-only crossover revealed in 2022, is built at the Tychy plant in Poland alongside its sister models, the Alfa Romeo Junior and Fiat 600. It’s only been offered with front-wheel drive, but now, a new 4xe hybrid trim adds what all Jeeps should have: four-wheel drive.
At the heart of the Avenger 4xe is a tiny 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with mild-hybrid technology. It's a three-cylinder turbo mill that develops 136 horsepower and routes output to the wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. Joining the ICE are two electric motors, one at the front and the other at the rear, with each developing 28 hp.
Jeep claims the new hybrid setup enables a sprint to 62 mph in nine and a half seconds and a top speed of 121 mph. At speeds of up to 19 mph, the Avenger 4xe always works in 4x4 mode with a 50:50 split between the two axles. From 19 to 56 mph, it defaults to front-wheel drive, but the rear motor is always ready to intervene should the need arise since. Go faster than 56 mph and the rear motor is disengaged to reduce fuel consumption.
The 4xe brings other benefits. The hybrid trim also gets a multi-link rear suspension and jacks up the ride height for an extra 0.4 inches of ground clearance, now at 8.26 inches. The 22-degree approach, 35-degree departure, and 21-degree breakover angles are better than those of a regular Avenger with front-wheel drive.
Jeep says the more capable variant can ford water up to about 15.75 inches deep. To sweeten the pot, there are Snow, Sand & Mud, Sport, and Auto driving modes to choose from. On top of that, customers can spend extra on the optional all-terrain tires better suited for tackling rough terrain.
Jeep has toughened up the Avenger's appearance by giving the 4xe rugged bumpers with a scratch-resistant finish. Roof rails come as standard, as does a rear tow hitch. Inside, the seats are upholstered in a waterproof material claimed to be twice as durable as before. The seats also have a special coating making it easier to remove stains and mud.
The not-for-America Jeep Avenger 4xe goes on sale in Europe late this year. It joins the already available mild-hybrid and purely electric derivatives that are both offered strictly with a front-wheel-drive setup.

"2025 Kia EV3 Revealed: Targeting $35,000 And 300-Mile Range",https://insideevs.com/news/720622/kia-ev3-global-debut-2025/,The world needs more affordable EVs for everyone. Is Kia's new EV3 the car we've been waiting for?,2024-05-23 06:00:00,"The people have spoken, and pretty much across the world, they want more affordable electric vehicles. They also want EVs with lots of range that can haul all of their stuff comfortably and charge up quickly so they can get back on the road without any hassles. Obviously, that's a lot to ask. But Kia may have just stepped up to the plate with an answer to almost all of those requests: the new, compact Kia EV3, which promises a high-range, affordable electric experience at last.
Not even nine months after the concept debuted at Kia's EV Day event in Korea, the nearly identical production version was unveiled today in Kia's home country. But the EV3 is going global. It's set to go on sale in Korea in July, then in Europe toward the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2025.
Kia aims to make ""EVs for all""
Though it shares hardware with corporate parent Hyundai, Kia is growing even more quickly and wants to be a dominant player in the global EV race. It's establishing battery and EV plants all over the world as it expands its lineup, which now includes the more affordable EV3.
And when it does, the specs Kia is ""targeting"" sound extremely compelling: up to 300 miles of range for the U.S. (and 560 kilometers globally) with a family price range of $35,000 to $50,000. In doing so, the EV3 could go mainstream in ways even Kia's current offerings have not yet.
More EV3 News
The EV3 ""underscores our determination to create world-leading electric vehicles that are accessible for all,"" Kia President and CEO Ho-Sung Song told journalists in a briefing this week. ""EV6 and EV9 established Kia as a key player in the global EV market, and EV3 is poised to extend EV ownership to a much broader group of customers.""
That would especially be the case with the EV3, where Kia is targeting 70,000 to 80,000 U.S. sales annually, which would put this compact EV among its top-selling cars.
Like those cars, the EV3 uses the Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP global electric car platform, but manages to be its smallest one yet. At about 169 inches (4,300 mm) in length and 61 inches (1,560 mm) tall, it's about on par size-wise with the previous Mini Countryman and smaller than the current Kia Seltos.
But that size puts it in rare company in the electric space; few modern examples of EVs exist at this size outside of China, and certainly not with such promising specs. And that size and price don't mean it's some bargain basement, rental-grade penalty box; with vehicle-to-load (V2L) technology that can charge various devices and a new ChatGPT-based AI assistant set to roll out on other Kia models, it could rewrite what we expect from small, affordable cars.
Kia says the EV3 will come with two battery packs available: a 58.3 kWh unit for the Base model, and an 81.4 kWh one for the Long Range model. The former is the same size as the one used on the entry-level, rear-wheel drive Kia EV6 Light. The latter is almost as large as the biggest pack in the updated EV6, an 84 kWh unit. In other words, this small car is packing a serious battery, especially in top form.
Both models use a 150 kW (aka 202 horsepower) motor to drive the front wheels. The zero to 60 mph time is said to be 7.5 seconds.
However, the EV3 uses a more cost-effective 400-volt electric architecture than the 800V one in the more expensive EV6 and other Hyundai and Genesis models. That usually means slightly slower charging times, but Kia says the battery to charge from 10-80% in approximately 31 minutes—not too bad.
DC fast charging is said to peak around 128 kW—down from the EV6's peak DC-fast charging rate of about 225 kW, which can go from 10 to 80 percent in under 18 minutes when plugged into a 350-kW fast-charger. Kia officials told our colleagues at Motor1 Italy that this was done to get a flatter overall charging curve so that power stays consistent at 128 kW and doesn't dramatically drop off as some EVs do. Still, Kia claims the EV3 will be a distance runner, able to drive driving from Paris to Geneva on a single charge.
Interestingly, the EV3 is also front-wheel drive, unlike the EV6, EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and others. But it will offer a more upscale GT-Line model at launch and an eventual GT  performance-focused dual-motor all-wheel-drive model.
The EV3 also boasts the latest iteration of Kia's i-Pedal 3.0 regenerative braking system, a tweak of the system in existing cars now upgraded to ""reduce fatigue on long drives."" More details on that as we get it.
In terms of design, the EV3 should look quite familiar. It apes the EV9 and the EV5 midsize crossover sold in China, but in a smaller overall package. ""We relaunched the brand in 2021, and we're trying to make sure, from the design point of view, that we are physically creating the brand values in the product,"" said Karim Habib, Kia's global design chief. ""So that's why consistency is important.""
Inside, there's a lot of commonality with the EV9 as well—lots of physical buttons to complement the dual 12.3-inch touchscreens. The interior also boasts a sliding table for laptops and other gadgets and a storage area for backpacks, snacks and other gear. There's also a small ""frunk"" storage area up front, and it looks to be a little bigger than the tiny one used on the EV6 and others.
Kia says the EV3 incorporates many recycled materials and biologically derived components inside and out. The dashboard is made from sugar cane, and the plastic body cladding panels are partially made from recycled plastic bottles.
Kia also says the EV3 will come with its first-ever in-car AI assistant, derived from OpenAI's ChatGPT. While generative AI remains in its relative infancy, the feature is becoming more and more common on modern vehicles. Here, it's used to provide navigation assistance, things like restaurant recommendations and help with various other productivity tools. With over-the-air updates, the assistant is also said to get better over time.
Clearly, there's still a lot we don't know about the Kia EV3, especially about its North American launch. The exact EPA-estimated range, charging times, and prices should be released closer to the car's launch here, which Kia says will be next year.
When it does, it will enter the ""affordable but modern"" EV segment relatively early. Over the next year or so, that segment will include the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV, and potentially a smaller, cheaper Tesla model as well.
Given Kia's aggressive EV push and its critical success with the EV9 so far, the EV3 also seems poised to be a winner. Until more competitors come along, it may end up being the affordable compact EV to beat.

That’s what the South Korean automaker is hoping for, at least.
The all-new entry-level electric crossover, slated to debut in the United States later this year or early next year, will first appear in South Korea and Europe. Underpinned by Hyundai Motor Group’s modular E-GMP platform, the brand-new EV3 promises a lot of tech and efficiency in the subcompact segment, impressive range figures and fast charging speeds.
It was first revealed as a concept car in its home country last year, and now it's time for the production-spec version to go under the spotlight. The concept looked pretty much like the finished product, so we expect the series model to be more or less the same. It also had features like vehicle-to-load (V2L), and it will be interesting to see if that makes its way to the production version.

Pricing is yet to be determined, but we can expect the EV3 to start somewhere around $35,000 when it reaches dealerships stateside. That’s for a front-wheel drive EV that looks like a shrunken-down EV9 with two massive screens inside.
More details will be revealed during the global debut live stream, which you can watch embedded above. The show starts on May 23 at 6:00 AM EST, and you can rest assured that InsideEVs has all the bases covered regarding EV3-related content.

Alpine Wants To Sell A Hydrogen V-6 Road Car,https://www.motor1.com/news/720348/alpine-v6-road-car-considered/,It would have over 340 horsepower.,2024-12-25 09:03:37,"With Alpine coming to the United States in 2026, we're keeping a close eye on what Renault's performance division is planning. Like so many other brands, the French marque is investing in fully electric vehicles, but the combustion engine could still play a role. The ICE could be saved by making it run on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels.
Alpine's design boss Antony Villain told Autocar the Alpenglow isn't just for show since it was developed with a production car in mind. While the concept features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a bigger V-6 is already in development. It's going to have more than the 340 horsepower offered by the four-pot. The larger internal combustion engine might find its way into a street-legal model that would be sold in a limited series.
When asked whether the Alpenglow has a shot of making it to production, Villain replied: ""Why not? Why not have that on the roads? We want to keep both ways [hydrogen ICE and EV] possible. Maybe we could do a little series of these cars for the road. That could be just right."" Alpenglow is an evolution of a namesake concept from 2022 and Renault's go-faster division is already planning a third variant that'll look closer to a production vehicle.
The sports car's current iteration is off to a rocky start since it failed to take part during its maiden test in Belgium at the Spa-Francorchamps track. It wasn't the combustion engine's fault, but rather an electrical issue. As it stands, Alpenglow uses an LMP3 chassis from Ligier, replacing the original concept’s bespoke chassis. The smaller engine will be swapped out later this year for the new V-6.
Speaking during the Annual General Meeting last week, Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo hinted at putting the Alpenglow into production. He said the A110 is not going to be on sale for much longer but the lineup will be renewed and expanded to seven models. The portfolio will be ""100-percent electric and maybe, potentially, hydrogen-engine cars.""
In the meantime, it’s sadly too late for the mid-engine A110 to come to the United States. Its electric replacement is due here in 2026 as a coupe and roadster, with an SUV arriving in 2027 and a four-door A310 swoopy sedan to follow a year later.

General Motors' Plug-In Hybrids Are Coming Back To The U.S. In 2027,https://insideevs.com/news/720220/gm-plug-in-hybrids-us/,"Almost 20 years after the Chevrolet Volt went into development, GM will bring back hybrid cars with a plug. Will Americans buy them?",2024-05-20 08:41:24,"After abandoning the idea of plug-in hybrids in the United States half a decade ago with the demise of the second-generation Chevrolet Volt, General Motors will reverse course—just in time for the new federal vehicle emissions regulations and a market where it's worried about uneven demand for full EVs.
The first plug-in hybrid models to be sold in North America will arrive at dealerships in 2027, GM CEO Mary Barra said in an interview with The Detroit News, the same year the new tailpipe emissions-cutting rules go into effect. Coincidence? Absolutely not.
New emissions rules
Starting in 2027, automakers selling vehicles in the United States will have to improve the average fuel efficiency by 2% every year for cars and by 4% per year for light trucks. By model year 2032, the proposed Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would require manufacturers to reach an average fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon per vehicle.
Of course, GM isn’t abandoning its all-electric vehicle plans. The Chevrolet Equinox EV is making its way to dealers, as is the retail-oriented Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, and there will be more affordable versions of all GM EVs coming by the end of this year, plus luxurious models from Cadillac. The reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV is coming soon as well.
More GM Stories
But as the regulations have changed and Americans’ appetite for pure electric vehicles has gone down in recent months, the automaker’s strategy shifted. Barra didn’t conceal that introducing plug-in hybrids while continuing to develop its EV portfolio is purely a regulation game.
“Plug-in hybrids are an important part of meeting the regulatory space and giving consumers more options. As the regulatory space evolved, it made sense for us to assess our strategy,"" Barra told The Detroit News.
It wasn’t a surprise back in January when GM’s head honcho told inventors that the company wanted to bring back plug-in hybrids, and it isn’t a surprise now. That said, we still don’t know what combustion-powered cars with an electrical plug will be available stateside three years from now.
In North America, GM’s last plug-in hybrid was the Chevrolet Volt, which was retired in 2019 as the company geared up for an all-electric future. In China, however, it’s a different story. Here, GM sells several plug-in hybrids and we might see a rebranded or slightly reengineered version of the Buick Velite 6 or the Wuling Starlight sedan. The Velite 6 is a station wagon that looks surprisingly similar to the European-spec Opel Astra, which used to be made by GM before Opel became part of Stellantis, while the Starlight is a larger, mid-size sedan.
Chevy Equinox Plus PHEV
The China-spec Buick Velite 6 is available as both a plug-in hybrid and an EV
Wuling Starlight
But seeing how the global automotive market seems to favor crossovers and SUVs, the China-spec Chevrolet Equinox Plus PHEV might have a higher chance of being sold stateside.
In a separate interview recently, GM President Mark Reuss confirmed to InsideEVs that similar PHEV technology as what's seen in China could be deployed on U.S. market cars, but it won't be the cars themselves. In other words, any U.S. PHEV models will be made more locally, not in China.

The New Bricklin Is Real And It Looks Questionable,https://www.motor1.com/news/719783/new-bricklin-3ev-details/,"The 3EV has three wheels, scissor doors, and a $28,980 starting price when it goes on sale ... sometime in the future.",2024-12-25 09:03:38,"The car you see here bears little resemblance to the iconic Bricklin SV-1 from the 1970s. Both have two seats and unconventional doors, and both have Bricklin branding. Beyond that, the bold-faced Bricklin 3EV you see here is in a class by itself ... for better or worse.
There is one other similarity between this Bricklin and its forerunner. Both are real. Visionary Vehicles is the company making the new car, which first appeared back in 2020 as a rendering. Frankly, we see renderings of proposed cars on a almost weekly basis, many of which never make it past the idea phase. So imagine our surprise when we came upon videos posted to the Visionary Vehicles website showing a 3EV prototype in action.
Details are still thin, but we know it's a three-wheeled EV utilizing body-on-frame construction with the battery pack centrally mounted between the frame rails. Power output is unknown, but the website promises ""superb performance"" along with a ""luxurious driving experience."" Diagrams from the company appear to show a single electric motor at the front, with the mid-mount battery giving the car favorable weight distribution. A range of 275-plus miles is mentioned, but specifics regarding charging speeds, vehicle weight, or the powertrain are unknown.
The 3EV is ""engineered by race car designers"" per the Visionary Vehicles website. Panoz Engineering is name-dropped, with MTV Concepts and Mike Vetter getting a mention for prototype fabrication. Andreas Haase is also listed for the styling, which certainly doesn't look like anything else on the road.
The tall face and dual grilles makes the BMW 4 Series snout look small. The squarish lines at the front give way to flowing fastback shapes at the rear, though the lack of wheel arches takes some getting used to.
This new Bricklin isn't just a rolling mock-up, though. We're shown a full interior with a digital cockpit not unlike something we'd expect from Mercedes-Benz. The entirety of the dash and console light up, with a dedicated infotainment screen in the middle for vehicle functions. The website mentions features like a heads-up display, power heated seats, over-the-air updates, and other common items found in modern cars. Cutting-edge equipment like anti-lock brakes and traction control are also mentioned, so we suspect the 3EV could be sparse with regard to driver-assist systems.
It should be sparse on your bank account, too. Visionary Vehicles says the 3EV will have a starting price of $28,980. An upgraded version called the 3EVX will start at $38,980, but there's an obvious catch: There's no mention of when production might begin. For that matter, there's no mention of a development timeline, pre-orders, or exactly where buyers can get one.
But a functioning prototype is a big step towards production. Whether it actually happens remains to be seen. Color us cautiously optimistic.

"BYD Shark, A Plug-In Hybrid Ford Ranger Rival, Launches In Mexico",https://insideevs.com/news/719677/byd-shark-phev-will-it-come-to-us/,The BYD Shark marks the Chinese automaker’s foray into the popular pickup truck segment. Will it ever come to the U.S.?,2024-05-14 16:59:18,"BYD doesn’t sell passenger vehicles here in the U.S., and the latest round of American tariffs on Chinese-made EVs all but ensures it won't for a while. But the automaking giant is going all guns blazing in Mexico. The world’s second-largest EV maker after Tesla already sells several all-electric models in the country, including the Tang SUV, Yuan crossover, and Seal sedan among others.
Now it has added another brand-new model to its portfolio in Mexico: the Shark plug-in hybrid. It's BYD’s first-ever pickup truck. The Shark marks BYD's entry into a segment traditionally dominated by American and Japanese carmakers. And for its first attempt, it appears impressive, at least on paper.
BYD's pickup truck enters global markets.
BYD's foray into the popular pickup truck arena that U.S. carmakers have traditionally dominated is meant to send a message: It plans to expand globally and is probably not rattled by punitive American tariffs.
Most specifications have now been announced on the BYD Mexico website. Apart from Mexico, BYD plans to sell the Shark in Brazil, Europe and Australia as well. Its only direct competitor is the Ford Ranger PHEV, but it will also lock horns with the likes of the Toyota Hilux and Chevrolet S10 among others, as our pals at Motor1 Brazil have pointed out. (While it has garnered headlines for its electric vehicles, BYD also sells a significant amount of hybrids as well.)
In terms of dimensions, the Shark is slightly longer and taller than the Ford Ranger, measuring 214 inches long, 77.5 inches wide and 75.5 inches tall. Its wheelbase spans 128.3 inches. The Shark’s maximum towing and payload capacities are 5,511 pounds and 1,840 pounds, respectively.
Like its rivals, it rides on a body-on-frame platform, using an architecture similar to that of the BYD Seal U SUV in China and the Fangchengbao range of off-road SUVs. BYD calls this the DMO platform, where DM stands for Dual Mode (hybrid) and O stands for off-road.
The plug-in hybrid system combines the 1.5-liter turbo engine with two electric motors, one on each axle, to deliver 430 horsepower. BYD says that’s enough to propel the truck from 0-62 miles per hour in 5.7 seconds.
Its electric-only range is about 62 miles on the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), so expect the real-world range to be much lower. It also uses BYD’s cutting-edge Blade battery, whose cells are part of the chassis structure.
In terms of design, the fascia has cues from the latest-generation Hyundai Santa Fe and the Ford F-150 Lightning. There’s a full-width LED light bar up front with a rather large floating BYD logo mounted on the radiator grille. Black cladding all around gives it the rugged off-roader look.
Inside, a 12.8-inch rotating infotainment screen dominates the dashboard, similar to the Seal. It is complemented by a 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster. Other notable features include a 12-inch heads-up display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and bidirectional charging among others.
BYD will offer the Shark in two variants in Mexico, GL and GS. The GL starts at 899,980 Mexican pesos (about $53,432) whereas the GS costs about 969,800 pesos ($57,577), according to the exchange rates at the time of publication.
By comparison, the Ford Ranger starts at around 818,000 pesos, while a mild-hybrid diesel Hilux costs about 851,400 pesos. In other words, the Shark is in good company.
The Biden Administration reportedly plans to slap a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, up from 25% previously. It’s unclear if that includes PHEVs, but launching a pickup truck in North America could be BYD’s message to the U.S. that it plans to expand its presence on the continent, regardless of what America thinks.
The question of whether Chinese EVs will enter the U.S. through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement remains debatable. Recent developments, including Mexico's refusal to engage in further discussions with Chinese automakers and the withdrawal of incentives, suggest that this prospect is improbable, at least for now.

The First Hybrid Porsche 911 Debuts on May 28,https://www.motor1.com/news/719326/porsche-911-hybrid-debut-may-28/,"It's 8.7 seconds quicker on the Nurburgring than its predecessor, the Carrera S",2024-12-25 09:03:41,"A completely new era for the Porsche 911 will begin on May 28. Porsche plans to reveal the first road-going 911 hybrid, pushing the iconic sports car into the modern era.
We've seen the 911 hybrid in prototype form for over two years now. Porsche tells us that development is now complete, amassing 3.1 million miles in the process. Some of that mileage comes from the Nürburgring, where Porsche shares a rather tantalizing clue as to what badge the electrified 911 will wear. We're told the hybrid laps the Nordschleife loop in 7 minutes, 16.9 seconds, 8.7 seconds faster than ""the corresponding version of the predecessor model.""
Basic math brings us to 7:25.6, and a quick look through recent Porsche 911 Nurburgring lap times brings us to the 992-generation Carrera S, which turned a 7:25 lap back in 2020. Images shared from Porsche don't reveal badges, but the lack of bonkers bodywork points to something on the milder side. A Carrera S with a hybrid powertrain certainly fits that bill.
“For the first time in our icon’s 61-year history, we are installing a hybrid drive system in a roadgoing 911,"" said Frank Moser, Porsche vice president for the 911 and 718. ""This innovative performance hybrid makes the 911 even more dynamic. We left nothing to chance during development and tested the new 911 under all sorts of conditions all over the world from the freezing cold to scorching heat, as was the case during the final stages of testing in Dubai.""
Details of the hybrid powertrain are as yet unknown. Porsche tells us it's aimed at performance, not efficiency, and we were previously told it won't be a plug-in hybrid. With a 'Ring time of 7:16, is should be plenty fast without losing its capability to carve corners.
All will be revealed on May 28. Be sure to check back in 18 days time, we'll have everything you need to know.

Subaru Is Teaming Up With Toyota On 3 More Electric SUVs,https://insideevs.com/news/719520/subaru-electric-suv-toyota-2026/,Three more electric Subies should hit the market by 2026. The company says four in-house-developed EVs will arrive by 2028.,2024-05-13 16:30:39,"Subaru has been rather slow to the electric vehicle party, with only one model under its belt so far. As we've noted before, that's pretty odd given that electrification certainly fits with the company's nature-loving image and crunchy clientele. Subaru's EV efforts are set to ramp up considerably with the help of longtime partner Toyota.
Subaru plans to release three new electric SUVs jointly developed with Toyota by 2026, Automotive News reports. Subaru executives detailed the plans during an earnings presentation on Monday.
Subaru's slow EV rollout
Subaru sells one EV right now: the Solterra SUV, which is manufactured by Toyota. Japanese automakers on the whole have been slower to embrace EVs than their South Korean, European, Chinese and American counterparts.
Why team up? Subaru CEO Atsushi Osaki said it's risky for the small automaker to wade into the uncertain EV landscape alone.
“At the moment, it is quite difficult to predict how things will go from here with EVs,” Osaki said, per Automotive News. ""We have held talks with Toyota and have agreed that it is better to reduce risks through joint development.”
That makes a lot of sense. Subaru is a whole lot smaller than players like Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors. The research and development costs that go into creating an EV from scratch are huge, as are the investments required to reconfigure plants that previously made internal combustion vehicles. Subaru doesn't have as much money to throw around as some of the bigger automotive players, so it's leaning on Toyota to spread out some of the costs.
(Its strategy seems to be working out just fine in the short term. On Monday, Osaki touted a 75% increase in operating profit for Subaru's fiscal year.)
That may also be why Mazda, another small automaker, isn't exactly diving into the EV market either. But it's also worth noting that the whole Japanese auto industry has lagged behind in EVs. Toyota especially has pushed the idea that hybrids and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be more significant than most people think. Still, both it and Honda are pushing ahead with big plans for ground-up electric cars.
The Solterra, Subaru's sole electric offering.
The current rough patch in EV sales has provided some vindication for Toyota's trepidatious strategy. But the overall trends point to EVs making up much more of the global car market than they do today.
At least one of the upcoming Subaru EVs will be produced by Toyota in the U.S., potentially qualifying it for federal purchase incentives. By 2028, Subaru plans to launch four in-house EVs, it said on Monday. It's also preparing hybrid versions of the Crosstrek as well as its top seller in the U.S., the Forester.
Subaru's only EV today is the Solterra, an SUV that's a close sibling to the Toyota BZ4X. Both have been criticized for their substandard charging speeds and range. I think I speak for Toyota and Subaru fans everywhere when I say this: Let's hope these brands' next EVs bring a bit more to the table.

"2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz Comes To America With 91 kWh Battery, Up To 335 HP",https://insideevs.com/news/719466/2025-volkswagen-id-buzz-91kwh-trims/,The long-awaited electric bus comes in three trims and available AWD.,2024-05-13 13:30:37,"Volkswagen announced the offer structure for the 2025 ID. Buzz model, which will be available in a long-wheelbase (LWB) version in the U.S.
The three-row, all-electric van will be offered in three trim levels—Pro S, Pro S Plus and a launch-only 1st Edition—all equipped with a 91-kilowatt-hour battery, although there is no info about the driving range yet.
Volkswagen ID. Buzz Enters America
The Volkswagen ID. Buzz will enter the U.S. market in 2024 as a 2025 model year. It will be a long-wheelbase (LWB) version with a 91-kWh battery. Both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions to be available.
The standard features include 20-inch wheels, a 12.9-inch infotainment system, 30-color ambient lighting, and Park Assist Plus.
There will also be two powertrain choices: 282 horsepower (210 kilowatts) for rear-wheel drive models and 4Motion all-wheel drive with a peak output of 335 horsepower (250 kW). However, not all trims get the AWD option—the Pro S is only RWD.
An important thing is that depending on the trim and powertrain, the ID. Buzz will have seven seats with a bench in the rear or six seats with captain’s chairs. The base Pro S will be only RWD and 7-seat. The Pro S Plus RWD is 7-seat standard but has a 6-seat option, while in the Pro S Plus AWD version, six seats are standard. In the case of the limited 1st, RWD is a 7-seater, while AWD is a 6-seater.
In other words, there is no 7-seat and AWD combination, potentially due to gross weight limit:
According to previous reports, the 2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB is expected to arrive in Q3 2024. The company intends to release the range and pricing closer to launch.
When it comes to options, the Pro S Plus trim includes an electrochromic panoramic glass roof, Harmon/Kardon premium audio, a head-up display, a Flexboard cargo system, a manually retractable tow hitch, and an Area View camera.
The launch-only 1st Edition is based on the Pro S trim. It comes only with a two-tone exterior with unique 20-inch wheels, roof rail cross bars, and 1st Edition badging outside. Volkswagen also mentioned the coastal-inspired interior, heritage-inspired floor mats, and exclusive 1st Edition owner’s gifts.
Let's recall that the Volkswagen ID. Buzz (passenger and cargo version) entered production in Europe in 2022. Initially, the model was available with a ""standard"" wheelbase, RWD and an 82-kWh battery (the AWD, introduced in Europe in 2024, is named GTX). In the U.S., there will be only a long-wheelbase (LWB) and a slightly larger 91-kWh battery.
The Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB's wheelbase is 127.5 inches (3,239 mm), 9.8 inches longer than standard.
During the first quarter of 2024, Volkswagen Group sold roughly 7,000 ID. Buzz. With the expansion to North America, this number might further increase.

Granted, this isn’t the first EV startup—or even the first Geely-affiliated brand—to go public. So we have to wonder: will this one fizzle out and underperform like the other IPOs of late? And what does this mean in the context of a thirsty yet uncertain EV market?
It’s not clear. Nothing is ever clear until the final shoe drops, and the markets close.
Since its IPO in 2022, Polestar has done almost nothing but sink, now trading at an abysmal 15 cents per share, as of this writing. I asked Zeekr how this time will be different, but the automaker's reps declined to comment.
Still, we can learn a lot if we just pay a little bit of attention. Let's compare Zeekr to other less-than-stellar newly public companies. It might just be a little bit more secure than the other special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) debuts that gave us the publicly traded Lotus and Polestar brands. It’s also in significantly better straits than VinFast, another IPO that fizzled out shortly after introduction. (Also, it's worth noting that nearly every company that went public with a SPAC, automotive or otherwise, has sunk like a rock.)
But one thing is certain: Zeekr is now the EV brand to watch, in China and beyond. It's already expanding into Mexico and Europe, and it may even have its eyes on the U.S. next. TechCrunch is already calling Zeekr ""the buzziest EV IPO of the year.""
Market position-wise, Zeekr occupies a luxury or premium segment that I’d say is equivalent to Acura or Audi. Zeekr is (theoretically) downmarket from Polestar, which aims to court Porsche buyers with its Scandinavian-style minimalist motif. Polestar is sort of a sporty Volvo, whereas Zeekr tends to focus more on exterior and interior adornment. That’s interesting since both Polestar and Zeekr’s design work was performed mostly at Geely’s Gothenburg, Sweden studio.
But while Polestar is really struggling for sales, Zeekr has consistently grown. Part of that success is offering a much fuller lineup of electric sedans, SUVs, wagons and even vans, while Polestar is just now getting around to adding two more crossovers after relying solely on the Polestar 2 sedan for so long.
For March 2024, Zeekr is up 117% year-over-year. It also has delivered more than 230,000 cars while expanding into more international markets. Last year Zeekr delivered 118,685 cars, while Polestar only moved 54,600. This means that Zeekr outsold Polestar at more than a 2 to 1 ratio, a number it mustered upright as the Chinese EV market is in a race to the bottom, price-wise.
Of course, like most EV startups, Zeekr hasn’t yet turned a profit. But Zeekr representatives said the brand is on track to be profitable by the end of 2024.
Zeekr is kind of an interesting duck here, especially for Americans. I’ve talked with Zeekr folks on several occasions here; the brand is more significant than a simple high-dollar electric Audi competitor. It’s responsible for a lot of the engineering and software work that is now used across the Geely Auto brands, including, yes, Polestar and Volvo. The Polestar 4 uses the same mechanical bits as the Zeekr 001. But just because Zeekr does a lot of behind-the-scenes work, doesn’t automatically mean it’ll come to the U.S.
Or does it?
Zeekr’s technology forms the basis for a self-driving Waymo car called the M Vision, and that's already a known quantity. But, when I’ve asked directly if Zeekr has plans for the U.S. outside of a commercial vehicle or its tie-up with Waymo, the brand has been fairly wishy-washy.
In October, Zeekr reps told me at a New York event that selling a passenger vehicle in the US was potentially on the table, but then followed up via e-mail saying it had no plans to sell passenger vehicles in the U.S.
I asked again a week before the IPO. “[The U.S.] is a market that [Zeekr is] looking at but not yet committing to for passenger vehicle sales,"" a Geely rep told me. ""Zeekr and Waymo are working together on the next generation of driverless vehicles; Zeekr will be providing the vehicle hardware, Waymo the driverless tech and experience.”
However, the U.S.’s attitude toward imported Chinese EVs has rapidly deteriorated within just a week of getting that statement. Zeekr's vehicles from China could face a new 100% tariff on its vehicles, which isn’t great for the brand’s outlook as a potential U.S. passenger car offering—or the price of its stock.
As my colleague Tim Levin said today, we’re entering a sort of automotive cold war here. Will Zeekr’s cars end up on sale in the U.S.? Right now, that feels more murky than ever.

Mercedes CEO Says EV Transition 'Might Take Longer Than Expected',https://insideevs.com/news/719012/mercedes-ev-gas-car-sales/,"Mercedes-Benz will keep making gas-powered cars ""well into the 2030s"" if buyers want them.",2024-05-09 10:00:03,"Mercedes-Benz once envisioned an aggressive, fast-paced transition to electric-only sales by the end of the decade. Now, amid a slowdown in the pace of EV sales growth, it's convinced that combustion engines have a future well beyond 2030. Mercedes-Benz chairman and CEO Ola Källenius made that clear during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.
""The strategic aim of Mercedes-Benz is zero emissions. That is certain. However, the transformation might take longer than expected,"" Källenius said, doubling down on similar comments he made earlier this year.
Automakers slowing their roll on EVs
EV sales have hit a rough patch. It's probably a combination of charging anxiety, high interest rates, high vehicle prices and a dwindling market of early adopters. That's making some automakers pull back their electrification plans.
He said that factors like how quickly charging infrastructure expands will impact the pace of Mercedes-Benz's zero-emission transition. Sales of hybrids, he said, could continue well into the 2030s ""if the demand is there.""
In other words, Mercedes plans to sell combustion-powered cars as long as people want them. Mercedes has set its plants up for flexibility, Källenius said, so that it can adjust capacity for both gas-powered and battery-electric cars to meet consumer demand.
However, Mercedes will have to contend with tightening emissions regulations worldwide. So, it must clean up its fleet regardless of consumer appetite.
Automakers, including General Motors and Ford, began pumping the brakes on their EV investments late last year, citing lower-than-expected demand from a changing customer base. EV sales have indeed hit some speed bumps in recent months, particularly when you look at Tesla's dismal first quarter.
But don't misinterpret the doom and gloom from Mercedes and others. EV sales have grown spectacularly in recent years and will continue to eat up an increasing share of the global auto market. Mercedes-Benz brand EV sales were up 73% in 2023. The automaker's backpedaling may have a lot to do with profitability concerns around its electric cars. As old-school automakers invest heavily in EVs, they've been deriving most of their profits from gas-powered cars and SUVs. Last year, Mercedes warned that the ""brutal"" EV market could harm its margins.
More Of Today's EV News
It's also important to note that Mercedes isn't doing as well on the electric front as its perennial rival, BMW. Electric cars made up 14.7% of BMW's global sales last year, versus 11.8% for Mercedes. In absolute terms, BMW sold 376,183 EVs across its brands in 2023. Mercedes-Benz's EV sales came in at 240,600.

"Lucid's Upcoming Midsize Car Targets $48,000 Price, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/718837/lucid-motors-midsize-price-48000/,The mysterious smaller Lucid is slated to start production in late 2026.,2024-05-07 15:53:28,"Lucid Motors' upcoming midsized vehicle will cost about the same as a Tesla Model Y Long Range, the EV startup's CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson reaffirmed on a call Monday evening. And his remarks indicated it may even be slightly more affordable than initially expected.
On Lucid's first-quarter earnings call, Rawlinson said that the future model will be priced at around $48,000. In the past, Lucid has said the vehicle would cost somewhere around $50,000.
Lucid Motors' path forward
Lucid Motors hit the market in 2021 with the Air, an impressive albeit expensive sedan. The upcoming Gravity SUV and a farther-off midsized vehicle are what Lucid hopes will launch it to profitability and wider recognition.
The vehicle, aka Project Midsize, is still years away, so that price could very well change. In recent years, numerous companies have either jacked up or slashed prices for their EVs due to changing materials costs and consumer demand. On Monday's conference call, Rawlinson said the model is still on track to start production in late 2026.
Lucid has only shown the midsize model under a sheet, so we don't know exactly what it looks like. It appears to be a crossover SUV-type vehicle.
The midsized platform is key to Lucid's growth and path to profitability. The startup produces an amazingly impressive sedan called the Air, but it's on the pricy side and hasn't sold in the kind of numbers Lucid expected. The company says it's on track to produce 9,000 Airs this year, roughly matching 2023's figures. That isn't because Lucid can't build them faster, Rawlinson explained on Monday. It's about drumming up demand.
""We are not manufacturing constrained. This isn't a ramp-up situation,"" he said. ""It's about growing awareness of just how awesome the product is and the sales will follow. And that's the trajectory we're on.""
More Lucid Stories
A $48,000 vehicle would dramatically expand Lucid's addressable market. That's not cheap, but it's in the same ballpark as Tesla's Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, some of the most popular electric cars on the planet. Fellow EV startup Rivian's R2 SUV is set to launch around the same time at a starting price of $45,000.
First, Lucid needs to execute on the Gravity SUV, its hotly anticipated next act after the Air. The three-row family hauler is slated to enter production later this year. It, too, promises to attract a whole new set of customers—and a boatload of revenue—to the fledgling automaker. It and the midsized platform are what's standing between Lucid being a niche maker of luxury cars that loses money and a significant player moving real volume.
What do you think? Would you buy a Lucid midsized car at $48,000? Let us know in the comments.

Jeep Gladiator 4xe Plug-In Hybrid Coming In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/718781/jeep-gladiator-4xe-plug-in-hybrid-confirmed-2025/,"The plug-in pickup will likely use the same powertrain as its Wrangler 4xe sibling, which is America’s best-selling PHEV.",2024-05-07 14:00:58,"After discontinuing the diesel-powered Gladiator pickup last year, the only powertrain available for Jeep’s sole pickup was the 3.6-liter V-6, which makes 285 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque.
But starting next year, the Gladiator will get the plug-in hybrid treatment, as the Stellantis-owned marque is expanding its electrified lineup. According to Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa, who posted the news on his LinkedIn account (post embedded below), the Gladiator 4xe PHEV will join the Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe–the best-selling PHEVs in the United States last year–starting in 2025.
Another PHEV for Jeep
Jeep already made a name for itself in the United States with the plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe. The two electrified vehicles are the best-selling PHEVs in the U.S., so Jeep is adding a third 4xe-wearing model starting next year: the Gladiator pickup.
Filosa left out all technical details about the upcoming plug-in Gladiator, but it will likely feature the same powertrain found on the Wrangler PHEV. That’s a 2.0-liter inline-four that works together with a starter generator and an electric motor that’s integrated into the eight-speed gearbox.
More Jeep Stories
In total, the Wrangler 4xe’s powertrain makes 375 hp and 470 lb-ft, which is much more than what the gas-powered V-6 is capable of despite the engine having a smaller displacement.
On the plug-in hybrid Wrangler, the high-voltage lithium-ion battery that provides juice to the electric motor has a capacity of 17 kilowatt-hours, resulting in an EPA-estimated all-electric range of 22 miles.
Again, we don’t know if these specs will be the same on the Gladiator, but they’re a good starting point for people shopping around. It’s also worth noting that because the electric motor is integrated into the gearbox, the Wrangler and the upcoming Gladiator PHEV retain their well-known off-road prowess because the drivetrain is unchanged compared to their ICE siblings. As such, the solid front and rear axles are still there from the factory.
Set to be built at the same Toledo, Ohio plant as the Wrangler and ICE Gladiator, the upcoming plug-in Jeep pickup will be joined by range-extended electric versions of the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer in 2025, while fully electric versions of the two SUVs will come in 2027. The agreement between Stellantis and the United Auto Workers union states that an all-electric Grand Cherokee will also debut in 2027, while the Wrangler will get full electric and range-extended versions a year later.",Iulian Dnistran
Pininfarina Made An Electric Batmobile You Can Actually Buy,https://www.motor1.com/news/718046/pininfarina-b95-battista-batman/,"If you have as much money as Bruce Wayne, of course.",2024-12-25 09:03:45,"Automobili Pininfarina has created a new line of ultra-exclusive cars that take their styling inspiration from Batman’s civilian persona, Bruce Wayne. The two models—the B95 and Battista—feature unique design touches tailored to make you feel like the billionaire comic book hero.
Pininfarina created two trims for its two cars: Gotham and Dark Knight. Gotham cars feature tan leather upholstery, bespoke center panel quilting, and tan stitching. The other trim uses black Alcantara, black leather upholstery, and black and gold duo-tone contrast stitching.
The Gotham Battista wears Argento Vittorio gloss paint on its exterior and has a Nero Torino roof. Pininfarina backlit its iconic logo, finishing it in brushed and polished anodized aluminum. The car has 20-inch front and 21-inch rear alloy wheels with gloss-black faces and matte-black rims. The B95 wheels closely match the Battista’s, featuring matte-black inner and gloss-black outer rings.
The Dark Knight Battista and B95 have Nero Profondo exteriors and Nero Torino roofs. They also share the same ceramic-polished rims.
Each car has a 120.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery powering four electric motors that generate 1,900 horsepower. The B95 and Battista can fly to 62 miles per hour in less than two seconds. The displays feature Wayne Enterprises enhancements and an instruction voice modeled after Alfred Pennyworth.
Pininfarina also tweaked the Battista’s aerodynamics, giving it new tailgate shark fins, louver openings, and rear carbon wings. It also has Wayne Enterprises logos on the side skirts and roof.
The special Pininfarina cars are the latest in a line of new products looking to wring every bit of value out of the Batman brand. The automaker and Wayne Enterprises, a luxury brand developed by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products, will launch their partnership at BruceWayneX.com and host an “invite-only, first-of-its-kind retail theatre concept” this summer where a lucky few will get to see a Battista. The site also has limited-edition jet skis, bicycles, and the iconic Tumbler from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy.
Pininfarina doesn't how much these two Batman-themed special editions might cost, but the Battista starts at $2.2 million and the B95 costs $4.8 million. So you'll need to be as rich as Bruce Wayne.

The Kia EV9 GT Arrives January 2025 with 'Enormous Power',https://www.motor1.com/news/717574/kia-ev9-gt-january-2025-debut/,"Meanwhile, an updated EV6/EV6 GT and Sportage will debut later this year.",2024-12-25 09:03:46,"Kia released business results for the first quarter of 2024, full of the usual sales and financial jargon. But with that press release, the company also published a recording of its CEO's Investor Day speech that took place earlier this month. And in it we discovered some juicy details about upcoming product.
The EV9 GT will break cover in January 2025 with ""enormous power"" from an upgraded dual-motor setup. Kia says it'll do 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds, which is impressive given the large SUV’s heft, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds. We’re expecting a major power boost over the 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet offered by the most potent version on sale today. The additional oomph will help the GT version shave off more than one second from the sprint time.
Unless Kia plans to improve the battery chemistry, the range will probably to take a hit. That's what usually happens when an EV gets the performance treatment at the expense of efficiency. The EV9 GT-Line available today does 270 miles on a single charge, per EPA. Kia mentions the full-fat GT model is getting a beefier suspension setup and upgraded brakes.
This isn't the only electric Kia SUV about to spawn a GT version. Although not mentioned during the CEO Investor Day, the EV5 GT (pictured below) has already made an early appearance in China. It was recently homologated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, with images showing up on MIIT's website.
Later during the presentation, which we've attached below, a product roadmap was displayed in the background. An updated EV6 is scheduled for a market launch in the second quarter of this year. The sporty EV6 GT will follow in early Q4. Kia also plans to tweak the popular Sportage in the final quarter of the year. Elsewhere, the first-ever EV3 and new K4 are coming in Q3 when the large K8 sedan unavailable in the United States is bound to get a mid-cycle facelift.
But first, a five-door hatchback version of the also-not-for-America K3 compact sedan is coming soon.

This Lotus Evija Broke A Very Specific Nurburgring Record,https://www.motor1.com/news/717421/lotus-evija-x-debut/,The 6:24 lap is the fastest of any car with a chassis of a production model.,2024-12-25 09:03:47,"Remember that wild Lotus Evija X we saw last year testing at the Nürburgring? It's now finally out. Strictly a one-off, the electric beast is a track-only version of the hypercar that holds a very specific record for being the fastest vehicle around the Nordschleife with the chassis of a production car. Allow us to explain.
It completed the lap in 6 minutes and 24 seconds, or 11 seconds less than the Mercedes-AMG One. The F1-engined machine is the fastest street-legal car ever around the 'Ring. However, the Lotus Evija X is not the fastest car overall to complete a lap of the Green Hell. The Volkswagen ID.R took 6:05 while the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo remains unbeaten, at an incredible 5:19.
Because neither the ID. R nor the 919 Hybrid Evo has any connection with production models, Lotus can brag about the Evija X's performance. It's worth noting that there has been another car faster than the Lotus beyond those two. In 1983, Stefan Bellof drove the 956 to a 6:11 lap. In the same year and with the same car, Jochen Mass crossed the finish line in 6:16.
The Evija X is likely to return to the Nürburgring and try to shave off seconds from its already impressive lap time. The performance it achieved back in October 2023 was on a damp track, so there's room for improvement. Lotus says we should ""watch this space"" regarding a potentially better time.
Aside from the crazy aero with a massive wing, the track car has Pirelli slicks along with new dampers and carbon fiber brakes. Underneath the skin is the same carbon fiber tub and quad-motor setup with 2,011 horsepower and 1,257 pound-feet of torque as found in the street-legal Evija. The four electric motors draw their juice from a relatively small 70-kWh battery pack mid-mounted behind the seats.
Lotus touts a 0 to 62 mph in less than three seconds and a 62 to 124 mph in under three seconds as well. The 124 mph to 186 mph sprint is said to take less than four seconds. Flat out, the road car is electronically capped at 218 mph. The road-going Evija has entered production many years after its debut, and only 130 units will be assembled.

"The Mazda EZ-6 Is The Electric, Rear-Wheel-Drive Mazda Sport Sedan We Want",https://insideevs.com/news/717485/mazda-ez6-china-debut/,"Available as an EV or a PHEV, the EZ-6 is an incredibly handsome and modern sport sedan. Hey Mazda, what would it take to bring this stateside?",2024-04-25 13:03:32,"I'm a fan of Mazda. I think that everybody who loves well-designed, fun-to-drive cars probably appreciates the brand on some level. That's why it's been especially disappointing to see Mazda end up somewhere between ""very late"" and ""non-entity"" in the electrification game. Sure, it has some plug-in hybrids and more are coming, but what would happen if Mazda really set its mind to EVs?
Today we found out at the Beijing Auto Show. The answer is the Mazda EZ-6, and it's a proper rear-wheel-drive, all-electric or plug-in hybrid sedan with next-level Mazda good looks. And I'm already a fan.
Mazda's slow approach to EVs
Mazda only offers one fully electric vehicle, the MX-30, and that was discontinued in the U.S. The Japanese brand, known for sporting cars like the Miata, has been an extreme latecomer to the electrification game. That may soon be changing, especially as Mazda seeks to keep up its sales in China.
This story comes with the usual caveats, like the fact that because it's a joint project with China's Chongqing Changan Automobile, it's extremely unlikely to ever come to North American shores. And considering how hard the ""foreign"" brands are getting hammered in China as the homegrown competition steps up, it's anyone's guess how successful it will be.
But here is a handsome, electrified, rear-drive Mazda four-door. I'm into it.
The design here is a clear evolution of the ""Kodo"" design language that's so appealing on the brand's other cars. It's supposed to be fun, too; Mazda says the ""Jinba Ittai"" (meaning horse and rider as one) spirit is baked deep into the chassis for sporty handling and braking. The EV model even has 50:50 weight distribution and an electric-powered rear spoiler. It also offers ""intelligent parking technology"" that even works outside the vehicle, implying some kind of Tesla Summon-like feature to me.
Mazda isn't offering any key powertrain details here, such as electric battery size, horsepower, zero to 60 mph times or even what size internal combustion engine the PHEV model will use. But the automaker does say the EV version will have a range of 600 km (372 miles) and the hybrid will do an impressive 1,000 km (621 miles.) Note that all of that is on China's range testing cycle, which is different from ours, but interesting nonetheless.
Even if Chinese car buyers are turning inward, Mazda also says it will keep working with local partner Changan to make the cars those people want, which increasingly are full-EV or have some form of electrification. ""Going forward, Mazda will continue to work with Changan Automobile to turn Mazda’s China business around by introducing its unique products that meet the needs of Chinese customers who prefer advanced vehicles,"" Mazda CEO Masahiro Moro said in a news release.
I wish I could say that this car previews some kind of EV (or even PHEV) sedan we're getting in the U.S. too, but I'd say that's extremely unlikely. Instead, it is proof that even if it needs a local Chinese partner to do it, Mazda is making moves in the electrification space.
And hey, let's hope any new Mazda sedans that come our way do look this good—and are powered by electrons, too.

Lamborghini Urus Plug-In Hybrid Keeps the V-8 and Adds More Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/717143/lamborghini-urus-se-phev-details/,"The Lamborghini Urus SE gets a transmission-mounted electric motor that, combined with the twin-turbo V-8, delivers 789 horsepower.",2024-12-25 09:03:48,"Leave it to Lamborghini to make a plug-in hybrid SUV exciting. The new Urus SE is an electrified version of the company's best-selling model, now with more power and speed. Although a PHEV setup typically implies a downsized engine, that's not the case here. The twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is sticking around, supplemented by an electric motor.
Housed within the eight-speed automatic transmission, the e-motor produces 189 horsepower and 356 pound-feet of torque. The gasoline engine is rated at a substantial 612 hp and 590 lb-ft. Combined, the two deliver a total system output of 789 hp at 6,000 rpm and a mountain-moving 701 lb-ft from 1,750 rpm.
Compared to the Urus S, the new SE is 0.1 seconds quicker to 62 mph, completing the task in 3.4 seconds. It's worth noting the Performante remains the quickest of the Urus range, at 3.3 seconds. This new raging bull reaches 124 mph in 11.4 seconds, or 1.1 second before the gas-only version, and even 0.1 seconds before the spicy Urus Performante. Flat out, it can do 194 mph, making it a tiny bit faster than both V-8-only flavors.
The Urus SE comes with a 25.7-kWh lithium-ion battery mounted below the cargo floor, good for over 37 miles of pure electric range. Driven in EV mode, the SUV tops out at 81 mph. After that, the V-8 automatically kicks in. Lamborghini goes as far as to say emissions are down by 80 percent compared to the pure ICE model.
With the plug-in hybrid, Lamborghini takes the opportunity to give the SUV a nip and tuck. Those updated matrix LED headlights now have a daytime running light signature that takes after a bull's tail, or so we're told. There are some discreet tweaks to the front section with design elements derived from the Revuelto supercar. The rear apparently takes after the Gallardo, and increases downforce by 35 percent compared to the Urus S.
Lambo will sell the electrified SUV with new 23-inch wheels, over 100 body color options, and 47 interior themes. If none of them tickle your fancy, there's also the Ad Personam program for one-off builds ... provided your bank account can handle it. The Urus SE comes with a pair of 12.3-inch screens and four new selectable modes: EV Drive, Hybrid, Performance, and Recharge. These are on top of the usual Strada, Sport, Corsa, Neve, Sabbia, and Terra.
We're wondering whether a similar V-8 PHEV setup is also planned for the Huracan replacement coming later this year. We already know Lamborghini is retiring the V-10, with plans to downsize going forward.
As for the Urus, Lamborghini has already confirmed the second-generation model will be strictly an EV when it launches in 2029. So if you want a gas-powered exotic SUV from the legendary Italian brand, get your order in now.

The Mini Aceman Is An Electric City Crossover With Up To 252 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/717331/mini-aceman-electric-official-specs-range/,Say hello to Mini’s new entry-level crossover. Again.,2024-04-24 10:15:19,"In what feels like the third rerun of Groundhog Day, the all-new Mini Aceman electric urban crossover has been officially unveiled–this time, without wearing any camouflage.
Mini’s new entry-level crossover, which sits between the new Cooper hatchback and Countryman crossover, did the rounds several times in the past 12 months, including in a set of official photos showing the car wearing some funky camo. But this time it’s officially … official.
Mini Aceman debuts as the company's smallest electric crossover
The Mini Aceman is here. Well, sort of. It debuted in China today and will reach Europe later this year, but it's unclear if it will become available in the United States. That leaves Americans with just the Countryman as the all-electric Mini crossover.
The electric Aceman will be available with two powertrain options, both front-wheel drive. The Aceman E has a single electric motor that makes 181 horsepower (135 kilowatts) and 213 pound-feet of torque, enabling it to sprint from zero to 62 miles per hour in 7.9 seconds.
More Mini News
The sportier Mini Aceman SE gets a power boost to 214 hp (160 kW) and a torque bump to 243 lb-ft, while the 0-62 mph time goes down to 7.1 seconds.
A 42.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides energy to the base Aceman E and enables a WLTP-rated range of up to 192 miles, while the top-spec Aceman SE gets a larger, 54.2-kWh pack that ups the maximum driving range to 252 miles on a full charge.
Speaking about charging, Mini’s smallest electric crossover can be topped up from an AC source at up to 11 kW. When connected to a DC fast charger, the Aceman E can accept up to 75 kW and the Aceman SE up to 95 kW, leading to a 10% to 80% recharge in just under 30 minutes, the company said.
As with every other Mini model, the electric Aceman’s go-kart feel is touted in the very first paragraph of the official press release, so until we get to drive it, we have to take the company’s word for it.
Inside, the (presumably) most affordable all-electric crossover in the automaker’s lineup features roughly the same dashboard layout as its slightly smaller hatchback sibling. There’s a round OLED display that doubles as the infotainment and instrument cluster on top of the center console and a set of toggles under it for things like the gear selector, parking brake and start/stop switch.
There’s space for five people and a 10.59 cubic feet (300 liters) boot that can be expanded to 35.49 cu-ft (1,005 l) when the back seats are folded.
The electric Mini Aceman is 160.2 inches long, 68.8 in wide and 59 in tall, making it roughly 9 in shorter than the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV.
Four trim levels will be offered. The Essential features black sports seats, a two-spoke steering wheel and a colored textile inlay on the dashboard. The Classic trim comes with a three-spoke steering wheel, while the Favored trim includes a dashboard finished in Dark Petrol and sports seats with perforated Vescin fabric.
Mini's new all-electric lineup features the Cooper hatchback (left), Aceman (center) and Countryman (right)
The top JCW trim–note that this is not the high-performance John Cooper Works version but just an equipment level–replaces the standard front seats with a pair that offers more lateral support wrapped in multi-colored knitted textile and black synthetic leather.
The electric Mini Aceman will initially be built in China by Spotlight Automotive, a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group, Mini’s parent company, and Great Wall Motor. In 2026, the Mini plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, will also start assembling the battery-powered Aceman.
Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, and as it stands now, the Aceman is not coming to the United States, with a company spokesperson telling InsideEVs that “we have not confirmed U.S. market availability at this time.”",Iulian Dnistran
2025 BMW i4 Gets A New Face And Laser Tail Lights,https://insideevs.com/news/717127/2025-bmw-i4-facelift-specs/,The driving range is unchanged compared to the outgoing model.,2024-04-24 08:53:19,"The all-electric BMW i4 four-door liftback just got a mild facelift, three years after its introduction. The 2025 BMW i4 comes with a redesigned face that includes full LED headlights, laser-accented tail lights and several other cosmetic changes inside and outside.
That said, the official press release doesn’t mention anything about the car’s performance, driving range or charging speeds, so the specs are most likely the same as on the outgoing model.
BMW's most affordable EV gets a makeover, albeit a small one
The BMW i4 is the German company's cheapest electric vehicle, and it just got a mid-life refresh that brings a redesigned face and some other visual tweaks.
However, the hard specs remain unchanged compared to the outgoing model, so will the cosmetic changes be enough to convince new buyers?
In other words, expect the 2025 BMW i4 to offer up to 536 horsepower and 586 pound-feet of torque as is the case with the top-spec 2024 i4 M50, while the maximum estimated range should be 307 miles, as with the 2024 i4 eDrive40.
Two battery sizes are currently available, depending on the selected version: 68.7 kilowatt-hours and 84.3 kilowatt-hours. Charging the battery from a DC fast charger takes roughly 30 minutes, according to BMW. The i4's updated Plug & Charge Multi Contract function also lets you store up to five ""contracts"" with EV charging companies, allowing you to plug in and pay for electricity immediately without having to use a credit card or authentication app.
More BMW i4 Stories
On the outside, the facelift brings redesigned adaptive full LED headlamps as standard on all models, black high-gloss accents, new paint finishes and new alloy wheels. The top-spec i4 M50 xDrive also gets BMW’s Laserlight tail lights as standard, while lesser models can get the visually intricate feature when the optional Shadowline Package is fitted.
The laser-accented rear lights have laser diodes that illuminate a fiber optic bundle resulting in a look similar to that seen on the limited-edition BMW M4 CSL. On the M Performance i4 M50, the front vertical kidney grille has a black high-gloss surround.
Inside, the refreshed i4 comes with the automaker’s latest iDrive infotainment system which is underpinned by the BMW Operating System version 8.5. The multimedia suite can be specced together with a curved display and the Live Cockpit Professional feature that comes with a full-color head-up display and the ability to show the driver an augmented reality video on the center screen when using the navigation system.
The latest iDrive version also gets rid of the physical buttons for the climate control system and integrates them into the digital realm.
The 2025 i4, as well as its combustion-powered 4 Series Gran coupe sibling, gets sport seats covered in perforated Sensatec fabric as standard, as well as a two-spoke steering wheel with illuminated multifunction buttons. The optional M Sport Package adds a leather M steering wheel in a three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a black center stripe marking the 12 o’clock position.
Production of the facelifted BMW i4 will start in July 2024 at the company’s plant in Munich, Germany. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but we expect the 2025 i4 to have a starting MSRP similar to the outgoing model.
The base 2024 BMW i4 eDrive35, which has an estimated driving range of 252-276 miles starts at $52,200, while the top i4 M50 trim starts at $69,700.",Iulian Dnistran
Future Electric Mercedes Cars Will Be Named 'With EQ Technology',https://insideevs.com/news/717212/mercedes-eq-naming-electric/,"Say goodbye, eventually, to the ""EQE"" and ""EQS"" naming scheme. Mercedes is sticking with the iconic names you know and love for future EVs.",2024-04-24 08:12:53,"The folks at Mercedes-Benz won't come out and directly say it, but they get that people aren't really into the current ""EQ"" family of electric vehicles. Their ultra-smooth styling has proven extremely polarizing, sales have trailed rivals like BMW, and to top it off, there's no way around the awkwardness of names like ""AMG EQS SUV."" So for its next go at EVs, Mercedes is taking a different approach: keeping the ""class"" names people know and love, but appending the title ""with EQ Technology,"" just like on this new Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology.
We've known for over a year that Mercedes was planning to drop the dedicated ""EQ"" brand for electric vehicles. But we didn't know what form the next step would take until Britta Seeger, the Mercedes AG board member for marketing and sales, confirmed the new strategy on a call with reporters ahead of the electric G-Class' debut.
Mercedes' rocky EV rollout
In the high-tech arms race toward the future of cars, Mercedes leads in some areas, like voice-controlled features. But in many ways it is trailing rivals like BMW who are making the electric transition with stronger sales, and the current crop of EQ-branded EVs have proven extremely polarizing. Will this new naming system keep things more familiar?
""This is the first car where we say, we'll keep our product name and we concentrate on the technology which is inside,"" Seeger said of that SUV. ""To 99-point-something percent, you will see they're equal, design-wise. This is why we've chosen to say this is a G-Class with EQ Technology. This will be, going forward, our nomenclature for those cars.""
She added that models ""on the market"" right now, like the EQE and recently redesigned EQS, will keep their current names. But she confirmed that upcoming models, such as the production version of the electric CLA Concept, would be called ""CLA with EQ Technology"" or something similar.
""Why did we choose [to do] so? Because we've seen that message the Mercedes customers they love to identify themselves with the classes we have,"" she said, such as being an E-Class or S-Class owner. ""We believe it's the right point in time to stand with the G-Class name and concentrate on the technology that you find inside, and this will be the same for all future cars to come.""
Seeger added, ""This is why we put, at the forefront, the classic Mercedes name of a class [like] C-Class, and then we concentrate on the technology.""
The move makes sense, and it tracks with a certain sentiment both inside the company and outside of it: that the current approach with the EQ cars isn't exactly working.
At CES this year, Mercedes’ VP of car engineering Christoph Starzynski told Top Gear that those cars' designs have put off traditional Benz buyers. And in a ""fully electric"" world, it was becoming a challenge to name all of their cars. (For the record, I am actually a fan of the EQE sedan, but I seem to be in the minority there.)
Besides, names like S-Class, E-Class and G-Class have decades of brand equity that other rivals would kill for; why get rid of those just because the powertrains are different? It's a bit like how BMW's upcoming Neue Klasse platform is expected to keep the 3 Series and X3 names in some way. Automakers don't want to throw those out when they dump gasoline.
Audi has had similar struggles, but instead is opting to make even-numbered cars like A4 and Q6 into EVs while keeping the odd-numbered ones combustion-powered. We'll see how long that approach sticks around, because it's arguably more confusing.
With any luck, then, the new G-Class with EQ Technology gives us a preview of what to expect from Mercedes in the coming years: cars much closer to the conventional ones everyone knows, just with batteries instead of engines—and maybe a bit more of a mouthful of a name.

Mercedes-Benz G580 With EQ Technology: A Quad-Motor Electric Off-Roader With Old School Vibes,https://insideevs.com/news/717037/2025-mercedes-g-wagen-electric/,"On the surface, there are very few surprises about the electric G580. It's under the skin that matters.",2024-04-23 22:30:00,"When it came time for Mercedes-Benz to turn the iconic G-Class SUV into an electric vehicle, certain voices within the company suggested it become smoother, more streamlined, less brick-like in shape, all for the sake of efficiency. Those voices were met with a clear and decisive response: ""No.""
Meet what used to be called the Mercedes-Benz EGQ, and is now officially named the 2025 Mercedes-Benz G580 with EQ Technology instead. It's a fancy and somewhat convoluted name for something relatively simple in concept: a G-Class SUV that's powered by batteries and not a diesel or gasoline engine. And though it doesn't look that way on the surface, it represents the most radical change in the Geländewagen's entire history.
Mercedes' EV push has had some setbacks
Customers have not warmed to Mercedes' EV offerings as they have with some other competitors, like BMW. The company is slowing down its own EV plans, but new offerings like this electric G-Class show it's far from done.
“Throughout its more than 45-year history, the G-Class has always used the most modern drive technology available,"" Mercedes board member Markus Shäfer said in a news release. ""So, it's entirely fitting that the innovative drive concept with four individually controlled electric motors once again raises the legendary performance of our off-road icon to a new level.""
Indeed, the word ""icon"" comes up quite a bit when Mercedes talks about this EV; clearly, the automaker didn't want to mess with a design that hasn't changed much since its debut in 1979.
Then again, who would really want a G-Class that doesn't look like it's about to be deployed to some global hot zone? Even if the luxury SUV is now ultra-popular with Russian gangsters, petrostate nepo babies and Instagram influencers, it just isn't the same without that military truck vibe.
The twin-turbocharged V8 engine that served as the hallmark of the G-Class in recent years is a tough act to follow. In its place, Mercedes has packed a relatively large 116-kWh lithium-ion battery into the steel ladder frame of the truck. That's protected by a mix of materials, including carbon, to keep your next off-roading excursion lithium-ion battery fire-free, at least hopefully.
The battery powers four independently controlled electric motors located near the wheels, which deliver a collective 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque. Its EPA-estimated electric range has not been released yet. But we know that power is enough to propel the hefty electric G-Class (the weight also remains undisclosed) from a stop to 60 mph in just 4.6 seconds.
The G with EQ Technology—maybe we'll stick to EQG for brevity's sake—can also undergo DC fast charging at a respectable 200 kW rate. That allows it to charge from 10% to 80% in 32 minutes, according to Mercedes, which is not as good as some new contenders but isn't too far off the rest of the truck pack these days.
Like other EQ models, the electric G-Class adds Navigation with Electric Intelligence, which provides on-the-fly adjustments to your charging needs based on traffic, road hazards, the overall route, topography and more. It can alert you to a charging station when you'll need it, and then find a good one near you. I have used this system on other electric Benzes and it is indeed one of the smarter ones on the market today, and a welcome addition to the G-Class.
Other than that, visually, little is different between the EQG and the fossil fuel-powered G-Class. The hood is raised slightly on the electric SUV, flared rear wheel arches with “air curtains”, new A-pillar cladding and the lack of exhaust pipes give it away.
There's also the unique rectangular Design Box on the rear door, which allows for stowage of things like charging cables (detachable ones are the norm in Europe) or snow chains.
But it's clear that Mercedes didn't just shove some batteries into the G-Class and call it a day.
But even if few of them get driven this way—the G-Class' biggest market is Miami—these SUVs still have to be off-road-capable. And the electric G doesn't seem to disappoint on that front.
Features include a ""low-range"" off-road gear reduction, the G-Turn rotation function, a G-Steering trick that reduces the turning circle in off-pavement situations and is good for speeds up to 15 mph, and variable speeds and settings for ""intelligent"" hill ascent and descent. And like the gas-powered G-Class, this EV also gets Mercedes' ""transparent hood"" tech that provides a visualized view of what's under the front of the car, to better navigate those tricky off-road situations.
And since it has no ""engine"" in need of oxygen, the electric G-Class is actually a better off-roader in some ways than its gas-powered counterparts. Its fording depth is rated at 33.5 inches, higher than the G 550 and AMG G63, and it can also climb up to a 100 percent grade on suitable surfaces. Mercedes lists says the EQG is capable of a 32-degree approach angle, 30.7-degree departure angle and 20.3-degree breakover angle, and it has 9.8 inches of ground clearance between the axles.
On the inside, this G-Class is pretty far from a '70s military truck. Screens abound, including a 12.3-inch driver display and 12.3-inch central multimedia display. And if the owner checks the box for it, passengers can watch movies and browse the internet with two integrated 11.6-inch touch displays for the back seat.
Add in the ""G-ROAR"" feature that creates different combustion engine-like sounds, 64 colors for ambient lighting and a special digital cockpit for off-roading, and yes, it's a clear a lot is going on here.
As silly as it is, people love the G-Class; Mercedes has only seen its sales skyrocket upward in recent years, especially the go-fast AMG models. But will those buyers be down to trade their thundering V8 engines for electric power?
If they do, the Edition One Special Edition will be exclusive to the U.S. as a 2025 model year car. It arrives at dealerships in the second half of 2024; pricing will likely be announced closer to its launch.
In the meantime, InsideEVs is due to drive the G580 with EQ Technology next week. We'll let you know if this battery-powered beast can live up to the legend or not.

The Tesla Robotaxi May Be Called The 'Cybercab',https://insideevs.com/news/717207/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-elon-musk/,Elon Musk may have teased the name of its upcoming autonomous vehicle.,2024-04-23 17:46:52,"Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla's robotaxi will be unveiled in August. Apart from that detail, the vehicle is largely shrouded in mystery.
Now we know at least one thing about it. Well, maybe.
Tesla's Robotaxi Plans
Elon Musk has for years said that autonomous Teslas would someday be able to act as driverless taxis. That future is still most likely a ways off.
During Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, Musk off-handedly called the forthcoming autonomous vehicle ""Cybercab.""
""And as we've announced we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August,"" Musk said on the call.
Was that just him messing around, as he so often does? Or was it actually what Tesla will call the driverless vehicle? So far, that's not clear.
The name would fit in with Tesla's existing nomenclature. Of course, Tesla sells the Cybertruck pickup. It also hawks other cyber-themed merchandise, like CyberBeer and the CyberHammer, all of which have the same brutalist, cyberpunk design as Tesla's truck.
The name would make sense given what we already know about the robotaxi's styling. Walter Isaacson, Elon Musk's biographer, reported last year that the robotaxi will bear a resemblance to the Cybertruck.
""When one of these comes around a corner,"" Musk said upon seeing a model of the robotaxi, according to Isaacson, ""people will think they are seeing something from the future.""
Musk dropped some new details about Tesla's plans for a ride-hailing business during the conference call too. He said that the automaker plans to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis and that Tesla owners will be able to add their cars to the service as they please. Of course, that bold vision depends on whether Tesla actually can succeed in creating an autonomous car. It hasn't managed that yet.

Struggling EV Startup Fisker Could Go Bankrupt Within 30 Days,https://insideevs.com/news/717161/fisker-bankruptcy-30-days/,Things are looking increasingly dire for the California-based electric car company.,2024-04-23 13:24:44,"Things have gone from bad to worse for Fisker. On Tuesday, the embattled electric vehicle startup announced in a regulatory filing that it expects to file for bankruptcy within the next 30 days if it can't get relief from its creditors or raise some extra cash.
Fisker also said it missed an $8.4 million interest payment in March, leading it to default on that loan. To stave off the worst, the company is cutting costs. In the filing, it said it ""intends to further reduce its workforce and streamline its operations, including reducing its physical footprint.""
Fisker On The Brink
American electric vehicle startup Fisker has been struggling financially for months. It started selling vehicles last year but has had to grapple with problematic vehicles and slow sales.
Fisker has been struggling to stay afloat for some time now. In February, the company said that it could run out of money within 12 months and that it planned to cut 15% of staff. It paused all development of future vehicles and sought a life raft from an established car manufacturer, reportedly Nissan. But those talks ultimately fell through. It was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to an ""abnormally low"" share price.
We Want To Hear From You
Are you a Fisker employee, former employee or owner with information to share? Just want to vent? Contact this reporter at tim.levin@insideevs.com.
We can keep things anonymous.
To generate as much cash as possible, Fisker slashed prices for the Ocean SUV, its debut product, by up to $24,000. Fisker began delivering its SUV in the U.S. in 2023 but struggled to ramp up sales. On Monday, Fisker also said it had hired a Chief Restructuring Officer in a separate filing.
The company's decline has left Ocean owners in a difficult spot. Their vehicles, some of which cost around $70,000 when new, have depreciated by thousands of dollars virtually overnight. The prospect of bankruptcy raises doubts about whether Ocean drivers will be able to get their vehicles serviced.
While many Ocean owners like their cars, the vehicles have been far from worry-free. Owners told InsideEVs about all sorts of nagging software bugs, as well as more serious issues. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating various problems with the vehicles.
Of course, there's still a chance that Fisker will pull through with the help of some partnership. But the clock is ticking.

BYD Shark Is China’s New Plug-In Hybrid Pickup Truck,https://insideevs.com/news/716991/byd-shark-plug-in-pickup/,The BYD Shark is a plug-in hybrid that may also get a fully electric version at some point.,2024-04-22 15:30:59,"BYD has confirmed the name of its first plug-in pickup truck that it plans to unveil at the Auto China 2024 expo (the Beijing Motor Show), which starts on Thursday. It will be called the BYD Shark, and at launch, it will be available with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, with the possibility that a fully electric variant will be announced at some point down the line.
The Shark will be about the same size as the Ford Ranger PHEV, which is also its only direct rival since there isn’t another plug-in pickup in this size class available in China, Europe or Australia where it will be sold. BYD has not announced the specifics of the Shark’s powertrain, but it shares its platform with the front-wheel-drive BYD Seal U SUV, which packs a 1.5-liter gasoline engine that, together with an electric motor, makes 194 horsepower.
BYD doesn't plan to sell cars stateside but may build them in Mexico.
BYD is the Chinese automaker that overtook Tesla for total EV sales in Q4 2023 and the Shark is its first plug-in pickup truck.
The Seal U PHEV has an 18.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack that provides up to 68 miles of pure electric driving. There are also two fully electric versions of the Seal U, which are already available in China and will also be introduced in Europe, with 71.8 kWh and 87 kWh battery capacities and claimed WLTP ranges of 260 and 310 miles, respectively.
The Seal U’s charging power peaks at 115 kW, and it supports vehicle-to-load (V2L) bidirectional charging. Sharing its platform with the Seal U, the BYD Shark will likely have identical powertrains and very similar specifications.
BYD also teased the look of the Shark pickup, showing its squared-off design and front daytime running lights, which feature a full-width light bar that connects its headlights. This makes it look a bit like the Ford F-150 Lightning, although the lower part of the headlights’ LED signature is quite different in the BYD.
The Chinese automaker previously showed photos of a fully camouflaged Shark, which gave us a pretty good idea of what the final production vehicle would look like. There isn’t anything particularly unique about the way it looks, and it seems to draw upon elements from other existing pickup designs. Inside, it will feature a 15.6-inch infotainment display powered by an eight-core processor.
BYD has not announced plans to enter the US market, but it already sells cars in Mexico, where it is reportedly considering establishing a manufacturing location. The company wants to build a factory with a yearly output of 150,000 cars that could potentially be exported throughout the Americas.

The New MG Electric Hypercar Hits 62 MPH in 1.9 Seconds,https://www.motor1.com/news/716915/mg-exe-181-concept-debut/,The concept car has an ultra-low drag coefficient of just 0.181.,2024-12-25 09:04:03,"With the 2024 Auto China show starting later this week, we're in for variety of attention-grabbing concept cars. MG will be in Beijing to showcase the EXE181 concept, an electric hypercar with a single-seat moncoque design. Sitting extremely to the ground, the striking EV looks like one of those Vision Gran Turismo cars.
The teardrop shape contributes to a remarkably low drag coefficient of only 0.181, which is better than the Volkswagen XL1's 0.199 and any other production vehicle. But some concepts were better. The 2022 Mercedes Vision EQXX concept had a Cd of just 0.18, the 2000 General Motors Precept had a drag coefficient of 0.16, and we can't forget about the 1954 Fiat Turbina with a remarkably low 0.14.
Regardless, the new MG EXE181 is a modern-day equivalent of a namesake concept from 1959. The UFO-shaped car before it supposedly had an even lower Cd of 0.12. The ""British"" brand owned by China's SAIC Motor says it's not just one of the most aerodynamic cars out there, but also among the quickest. It needs only 1.9 seconds to reach 62 mph from a standstill.
The Lucid Air Sapphire recently did it in 1.77 seconds, albeit to 60 mph rather than 62 mph and with a one-foot rollout. Last year, the Rimac Nevera took 1.74 seconds to get the job done. Elon Musk promises the new Roadster can reach 60 mph in less than a second but we're honestly finding that hard to believe.
As for top speed, MG doesn't say, but it does mention the EXE181 ""defies the land speed record."" The original concept from the late 1950s managed to reach 254.91 mph with American racing driver Phill Hill behind the wheel.
The extremely tight interior with a center-mounted seat and a racing harness is just as futuristic while reminding us of the single-seat Lamborghini Egoista. The new EXE181 has been envisioned with a yoke incorporating a large screen suggesting the car has four electric motors. Although MG is tight-lipped on other technical specifications, we can safely assume all-wheel drive and a combined output of well over 1,000 horsepower.
The chances of seeing a production version are likely slim to none since this looks more like a spectacular one-off affair to grab the headlines, which it has succeeded.

The 805-HP AMG GT63 S E Performance Is The Quickest Mercedes Ever,https://www.motor1.com/news/716809/mercedes-amg-gt-63s-eperformance-debut/,The GT63 S E Performance is the quickest-accelerating production vehicle Mercedes-AMG has ever built.,2024-12-25 09:04:04,"You knew it was coming. For those who prefer their insane Mercedes-Benz performance cars wearing sleek two-door clothing, you have a new toy. The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door coupe is here, and all indications suggest it was worth the wait.
Those familiar with Mercedes-AMG know E Performance is the company's name for hybrid power. You get 805 combined horsepower in the new GT flagship, courtesy of the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 at the front and an electric motor at the back. The gas burner alone accounts for 603 hp, but arguably the more impressive number is the combined 1,047 pound-feet of torque. With everything working together, Mercedes says the AMG GT63 S E Performance reaches 60 mph in a supercar-beating 2.7 seconds. The new-generation coupe might be bigger with its extra seats, but it's officially the fastest-accelerating AMG production model of them all.
While this is technically a plug-in hybrid, efficiency is not a factor here. The battery capacity is just 6.1 kWh, and Mercedes makes no mention of electric-only range other than to say it will be announced later. Instead, the battery's focus is on performance, and to that end, Mercedes keeps it at an optimal temperature to draw the most power when needed. Charging comes through either a plug or various driver-selectable recuperation settings, including a one-pedal mode similar to an EV.
A nine-speed dual-clutch transmission routes power through Mercedes-AMG's 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system. In normal operation, the electric motor only drives the rear axle, but when slip is detected, power can be routed forward. Rear-axle steering and the AMG Active Ride Control suspension with roll stabilization are standard-issue here, as are carbon ceramic brakes. Six-piston calipers grip 16.5-inch rotors at the front, mounted behind standard-issue 20-inch wheels, while 15-inch rotors with single-piston calipers can be found out back. Optional wheels up to 21 inches are available.
Appearance-wise, you'd be hard-pressed to identify the E Performance version from the standard AMG GT63 unless you get up close. Mercedes adds special badging to the trunk lid, and there's a door hiding a charging port on the rear fascia. Unseen are changes to the active aero system, designed to optimize performance specifically for the hybrid powertrain. In the 2+2 cockpit, it's standard-issue Mercedes-AMG, which means it's not a bad place to be.
Pricing for the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance two-door will be announced closer to its on-sale date in late 2024.

The New BMW i4 Arrives Next Week,https://www.motor1.com/news/716539/2025-bmw-i4-debut-date/,The BMW Group will bring the new i4 and Mini Aceman to the Auto China show.,2024-12-25 09:04:04,"With BMW offering such a vast lineup, there's always a new model around the corner. After introducing the updated 4 Series Coupe and Convertible in late January, the i4 will break cover next week. The electric 4er is going to celebrate its world premiere in Beijing at Auto China alongside the Mini Aceman.
BMW only mentions the i4, without the 4 Series Gran Coupe upon which the EV is based. It's unclear whether the model with combustion engines will be there as well. Spy shots of the zero-emission model have revealed redesigned headlights with boomerang-shaped elements inherited from the recently updated two-door 4 Series models. The front bumper will also adopt a fresh, albeit busy look.
It's too soon to say whether the 2025 BMW i4 is getting those cool laser taillights we saw on the 4 Series Coupe/Convertible. The M4 CSL had them first a couple of years ago, and so did the ultra-exclusive 3.0 CSL. They're now trickling down to the lesser 4 Series/M4 models.
Inside, the flat-bottomed steering wheel we saw on the ICE-powered, two-door models could come to the i4 as well. In addition, BMW is likely to transition the EV to its latest infotainment system, the iDrive 8.5. We're also expecting slightly revised central air vents surrounded by contour ambient lighting–as seen on the 2025 4 Series Coupe/Convertible.
Joining the i4 in China will be the Aceman, Mini's first electric-only model. Positioned below the Countryman, the new subcompact crossover is going to be built locally by Spotlight Automotive. It’s a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group and Great Wall Motor. The electric three-door hatch is also made there at a new factory in Zhangjiagang, China. The two EVs will also be assembled at home in Oxford, UK from 2026.
Auto China 2024 starts April 25 with the first press day. However, the BMW Group Night event is scheduled a day before, on April 24.

"2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 Gets 440 Miles Of Range, Higher Towing Capacity, Lower Price",https://insideevs.com/news/716215/2024-gmc-sierra-ev-denali-edition-1-updated-range-towing-price/,The top-spec Sierra EV pickup’s range is now on par with its Chevy Silverado EV RST cousin.,2024-04-16 09:00:00,"The 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, which is the highest-possible spec for GMC’s latest battery-powered truck, got a slight bump in the range and towing capacity departments ahead of this summer’s start of deliveries.
Now, GMC estimates that the top-trim Sierra EV can travel up to 440 miles on a full charge–40 miles more than initially estimated–and can tow up to 10,000 pounds–500 more than before. The maximum payload has also been increased by 150 pounds for a total of 1,450 pounds on the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1.
More range for GMC's fancy Sierra EV trim
The top-spec GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, which was unveiled back in 2022, got a specs bump ahead of this summer's start of deliveries. The maxed-out Sierra EV will deliver 10% more range, 500 more pounds of towing capacity and 150 more pounds of payload capacity, all while costing $9,200 less than originally announced.
At the same time, the price of the fully loaded electric Sierra EV has gone down by $9,200. According to GMC, the final MSRP of the truck is $99,495 including the destination charge.
More GMC Stories
The changes are similar to those applied to the Sierra EV’s Chevrolet cousin, the Silverado EV in top RST trim, which got a bump in range and a price cut of $10,000 compared to the initial specs. Both GM-made electric pickups are scheduled for delivery this summer.
In the EV truck space, the range king is currently the Chevy Silverado EV 4WT, which can go 450 miles on a full charge, followed by the Silverado EV RST and GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 with 440 miles of range. The Rivian R1T Dual-Motor with the Max Pack battery can travel up to 410 miles, the GMC Hummer EV 3X has an estimated maximum range of 381 miles, while the Tesla Cybertruck AWD has a manufacturer-estimated range of 340 miles.
In the case of the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, everything else stays the same. It will be available in limited numbers as a luxury-oriented vehicle with four-wheel steering, including the CrabWalk feature that originally debuted on the GMC Hummer EV. This allows the vehicle to travel diagonally at low speeds, helping the driver avoid obstacles while driving off-road.
The 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 comes with a pair of electric motors that deliver a total output of 754 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque when the so-called Max Power mode is activated.
Official details about the truck’s battery pack are not yet available, but the Sierra EV will likely use the same 800-volt, 24-module pack as the GMC Hummer EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV to achieve its range estimate. As for recharging, the Sierra EV is capable of accepting up to 350 kW from a compatible fast charger, enabling it to add about 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.
The Hummer EV’s more affordable brother also boasts a 19.2 kW onboard AC charger and the ability to export 10.2 kW of power through 10 outlets scattered across the pickup for things like tools or appliances.
The 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 also comes as standard with the MultiPro Midgate, which means the divider between the passenger compartment and the bed can be folded. With both the midgate and the tailgate open, the Sierra EV can carry items that are nearly 11 feet long in the bed.
Air suspension is also standard, while Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free advanced driver assistance system, will be available as an option.",Iulian Dnistran
"2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore: Finally, A New Convertible EV",https://insideevs.com/news/716180/2025-maserati-grancabrio-folgore-reveal/,"Weighting only 176 pounds more than the coupe version, the Cabriolet is expected to perform like its hardtop sibling.",2024-04-15 16:03:13,"At last, electric horsepower with some wind in your hair to go with it.
Today in the seaside town of Rimini, Italy, Maserati unveiled its latest all-electric machine: the long-awaited GranCabrio Folgore. Claiming the title “first luxury EV convertible,"" the GranCabrio Folgore made its debut with the usual Maserati panache, including a celebrity Italian DJ.
The Italian brand is serious about this vehicle. Boasting 800-volt technology and developed with technology reportedly cribbed from Formula E, the GranCabrio Folgore appears to be lightning fast and sleek and we’re looking forward to driving it in the near future. It’s part of Maserati’s plan to electrify its entire lineup by 2028, a timeline that was moved up from 2030 earlier this year.
The cabriolet version of the brand’s first EV, the GranTurismo Folgore, shares many of the same attributes as its hardtop sibling. Design differences between the coupe and the convertible are slim, in fact. Engineering is also nearly identical, boasting three 300-kilowatt permanent magnet motors and 800-volt technology for fast charging.
Head of design Klaus Busse has been with the Italian brand since 2015 and says the journey to electrification started eight years ago. Incidentally (or ironically, considering his size), the 6’7” designer also penned Fiat’s tiny 500e, which was just released in the North American market. Conversely, the GranCabrio offers generous seating for four average-sized adults.
Busse said he didn’t want the GranCabrio EV to be a “faceless car,” opting to invert the convex grille so that it has a distinct look for the EV lineup and promotes air cooling but maintains the Maserati feel. In essence, the solid bars represented on the gas-powered Maserati models are open vents instead, so it looks familiar but different.
Speaking of familiar but different, Maserati’s V8 is dying this year, which could mean the end of its trademark soundtrack. To perhaps tempt buyers who want to keep the vroom-vroom noises of a Maserati gas-powered engine, the brand’s Innovation Lab created a 3D sound system designed to emulate the rumbles of the ICE version.
Trident engineers mapped the frequencies of the eight-cylinder roar and digitized it for its Folgore lineup, feeding it through one of two audio systems by Italian speaker manufacturer Sonus Faber. In standard format, the audio system includes 13 speakers and 2D surround, with an 815-watt output; upgrade to the 16-speaker system for 2D and 3D surround sound with amplification up to 1060 watts.
Weighing in at more than 5,100 pounds, the convertible rides on a platform adaptable to ICE or EV, herefitted with a “T-Bone” battery pack. Impressively, the designers say no power is sacrificed at the droptop altar, and the difference in weight between the GranTurismo Folgore and GranCabrio Folgore is a mere 176 pounds. The automaker says it looked at the entirety of the vehicle, including its interior materials, to ensure the difference was slight.
Similarly to Audi’s S5 Cabriolet, the GranCabrio Folgore’s soft top can be opened even while driving up to about 31 mph. In 14 seconds, the car is converted to an open-air vehicle (and 16 seconds to close). Also like the S5 convertible, the GranCabrio Folgore includes neck warmers to keep the driver and front passenger comfortable with the top down.
The new GranCabrio Folgore can run in four drive modes: Max Range, GT, Sport, and Corsa. Max Range saves the most battery, and Maserati recommends running this mode when the power level dips below 16 percent. Maximum speed is throttled down to 80 mph and limits climate control as well. GT is touring mode for long drives, and both power and sound are decreased to 80 percent. Sport is for spirited driving, and Corsa offers up the whole cannoli (because “the whole enchilada” doesn’t work as well for an Italian car) of power.
Like the newest Ram 1500 pickup truck in the Stellantis lineup, Maserati’s new EV is built with the Atlantis High electrical architecture, previously seen in the GranTurismo. Equipped with “advanced cyber-security and flash-over-the-air features,” the EV convertible uses Maserati-designed software.
Available in 27 special Folgore finishes and the option to customize the GranCabrio through Maserati’s bespoke program, the GranCabrio includes six different wheel designs. The wheels are staggered, with 21-inch rims in the back and 20-inch versions up front. Inside, the brand continues to use recycled materials made from nylon waste from fishing nets and carpeting.
It remains to be seen if Maserati customers will embrace the EV technology in the lineup. With a $200,000 to $205,000 starting price that’s similar to its gas-powered cars and a soundtrack to ease buyers into the EV transition, it has a fighting chance and it sure looks tempting. Ciao bella, indeed.

Alfa Romeo Milano Now Named ‘Junior’ Because Of Italian Law Protecting Cheese,https://insideevs.com/news/716161/alfa-romeo-junior-rename-milano/,"The car will be built in Poland, not Italy, which means it’s not allowed to bear an Italian-sounding name.",2024-04-15 13:30:56,"Remember the Alfa Romeo Milano we wrote about last week? It’s the Italian carmaker’s first-ever series-production electric vehicle, so it’s a pretty big deal. Except it’s not called “Milano” anymore because Italy decided against that, and an obscure law originally designed for protecting cheese is to blame.
Alfa, which is owned by Stellantis, announced that its new entry-level subcompact crossover will now be called the Junior because it doesn’t want to get into a fight with the Italian government. The ""Milano"" name goes against a law that was designed to protect Italian-sounding names for products that are made in Italy, like Parmigiano cheese.
No Milano for you!
Just like the rather selective soup maker who made an appearance on the 1990s hit TV series Seinfeld, the Italian government forced Alfa Romeo to rename its new ""Milano"" crossover to ""Junior"" because it won't be made in Italy despite having an Italian-sounding name.
The problem is that the Milano—sorry, the Junior—will be built in Poland, making the original name in violation of the law in Italy.
“A car called Milano cannot be produced in Poland. This is forbidden by Italian law,” said Adolfo Urso, Italy’s Minister of Economic Development, referring to 2003 legislation that targets “Italian sounding” products that falsely claim to be Italian.
More Alfa Romeo News
According to Reuters, this law has been typically invoked in the past by the Italian government against food products like U.S.-made “parmesan” cheese which resembles Italy’s Parmigiano.
The rest stays the same. The Alfa Romeo Junior is based on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger and, just like its American counterpart, it won’t make its way to the United States anytime soon. It’s available as either an all-electric model with up to 240 horsepower or a hybrid with 136 hp.
Alfa Romeo said that despite believing the “Milano” name “met all legal requirements and that there are issues much more important than the name of the car,” it decided to change the entry model’s name to “Junior” in the spirit of mutual understanding.
I don’t know about you, but to me that seems like a major slip-up for a company that’s based in Italy.",Iulian Dnistran
The Alfa Romeo Milano Is A Small Crossover With Up To 254 Miles Of WLTP EV Range,https://insideevs.com/news/715724/alfa-romeo-milano-ev-official-specs-details-range/,It sits on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger.,2024-04-11 13:00:12,"Update: Alfa Romeo renamed the Milano to ""Junior."" The original story follows below.
After the demise of the combustion-powered Alfa Romeo Mito subcompact hatchback in 2018, the Italian automaker that made a reputation for itself by offering some of the most stylish cars on the market had a hole in its portfolio.
That hole has now been filled with the launch of the new Alfa Romeo Milano, a B-segment crossover that’s based on the same e-CMP2 platform as the Jeep Avenger and Fiat 600.
Alfa Romeo's new urban crossover is also its first EV
The new Alfa Romeo Milano ushers in a new era for the Italian automaker. It's the first-ever all-electric car made by Alfa and a new entry-level model at the same time, slotting under the Tonale crossover.
Just like its Stellantis relatives, the new Alfa Romeo Milano will be available as either an EV or a hybrid that combines a 1.2-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged engine with a 48-volt lithium-ion battery and a 21-kilowatt (28-horsepower) electric motor integrated into the six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In total, the hybrid Milano makes 136 hp.
More Alfa Romeo Stories
The all-electric version of Alfa’s subcompact crossover goes by the “Elettrica” moniker and is powered by a 54-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a maximum combined driving range of 254 miles on a full charge on the WLTP cycle.
Two versions of the Milano EV are offered. The base model has a 156 hp front-mounted electric motor, while the go-faster Veloce trim ups the output to 240 hp, but the car remains front-wheel drive. Alfa Romeo said that an all-wheel drive version will be available sometime in the future, but only on the hybrid.
Besides getting more power, the Milano Veloce benefits from “extra sporty” front and rear anti-roll bars, a 0.98-inch lower suspension compared to the base version, big brakes, 20-inch high-performance tires and the same limited-slip differential as in the upcoming Abarth 600e. Alfa Romeo says that the Milano also has the most direct steering in the segment.
Charging the diminutive EV can be done from a DC source at up to 100 kW, with the Italian automaker saying that going from 10% to 80% state of charge takes less than 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the on-board three-phase charger is rated at 11 kW.
Designed by Alfa Romeo’s Centro Stile in Turin, Italy, the Milano features a rather aggressive front fascia encompassing a so-called “3+3” headlight system with adaptive full LED Matrix lights. On the electric version, the grille features the company’s logo cut into it, while the hybrid variant has a more traditional grille with the Alfa Romeo script.
Alfa Romeo Milano hybrid
Alfa Romeo Milano EV
The Milano measures 164.1 inches long, 70 inches wide and 59 inches tall, putting it in the same league, size-wise, as the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV, which is roughly three inches taller than Alfa’s crossover.
Unlike the Bolt EV, however, the Milano will be strictly a European affair, with no plans to bring the souped-up hatchback stateside.
Inside, the new Alfa Romeo features two 10.25-inch screens, one that acts as a digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel and a touchscreen that’s the gateway to the car’s infotainment system. In the EV, the infotainment is connected to the internet and provides real-time information about over 600,000 charging stations across Europe.
The Italian automaker claims the Milano has the biggest trunk in its class–that’s the B segment EV class–with 14.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. There’s also a charging cable storage bay under the hood, a 180-degree rear camera and all-around parking sensors, as well as a series of advanced driver assistance features that translate into a Level 2-capable vehicle.
In Europe, customers of the Alfa Romeo Milano Elettrica will get a complimentary Wallbox charger from Free2Move plus an E-card that can be used for contactless payments at charging stations.
Pricing hasn’t been officially announced yet, but company boss Jean-Philippe Imparato hinted for Autocar that the Milano will start at around €30,000 in Italy.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Will Race at Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/715558/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-pikes-peak/,The hot EV will lose the rear seats in exchange for a roll cage.,2024-12-25 09:04:09,"Hyundai wants to show off the Ioniq 5 N's performance chops by bringing four examples of the hot EV to this year's Pikes Peak. The 102th running of the hill climb event takes place June 23 and will feature two production-spec vehicles along with a couple of modified cars. The standard ones won't be truly stock either since some tweaks will be made inside.
Going after the electric production SUV/crossover record, the two Ioniq 5 Ns won't have rear seats. Not because Hyundai wants to make the vehicles lighter but safer by adding a roll cage in the back. In addition, the driver's seat is replaced by a Recaro Pro Racer SPA Hans seat with a six-point Sabelt racing harness compatible with HANS (head and neck support). In case something goes awry, there's going to be a fire suppression system.
Other than these modifications, the Ioniq 5 N will be completely stock. It'll carry over the dual-motor setup from the road-going model, complete with up to 641 horsepower when overboost is active. In regular mode, the total system output is still a massive 601 hp. Hyundai touts a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.25 seconds with launch control and the extra temporary power. Flat out, top speed is electronically capped at 162 mph.
Eleven-time PPIHC winner Paul Dallenbach will hunt for records in one of the two ""stock"" Ioniq 5 Ns. The other one will be driven by rookie Ron Zaras, a former Hoonigan executive. As for the two modified vehicles, these will be piloted by WRC driver Dani Sordo and four-time overall winner and King of the Mountain title holder at Pikes Peak Robin Shute. The two will perform a test ahead of the grueling 24 Hours of Nürburgring set for May 30.
Hyundai is already evaluating the Ioniq 5 N at Pikes Peak, but the speedy EV will adopt an N livery instead of this red finish for the actual race in Colorado. The four vehicles are going to tackle the 12.42-mile course with no fewer than 156 turns. All drivers will go through an elevation gain of 4,725 feet, crossing the finish line at 14,115 feet above sea level.
The outright record at Pikes Peak belongs to Romain Dumas in the Volkswagen I.D. R with a time of 7 minutes and 57.148 seconds established in 2018. It's safe to assume the Ioniq 5 N won't get anywhere close since the VW was a purpose-built electric race car.

Updated 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQS Tones Down Looks And Goes Farther,https://insideevs.com/news/715669/2025-eqs-update-mercedes-benz/,Flush-mounted chrome bars on the front of the EQS usher in a traditional look for the radically-styled sedan.,2024-04-10 14:56:32,"The Mercedes-Benz EQS’s smooth, ovoid shape may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the brand has put effort into making it even more competitive for 2025. A new grille, the return of a traditional Mercedes-Benz styling feature, and revised under-the-skin electric components should make the EQS fight that much harder in an increasingly competitive big luxury EV sedan market.
The most obvious change to the 2025 EQS, is its front grille and new Mercedes-Benz standing star logo. Of course, it still has the same black panel shape that’s inherent to the rest of the Mercedes-Benz EV lineup, but the grille’s insert now resembles the chrome-crosshaired versions we’ve seen on its gas-powered cars. The emblem is now mounted standing up, like other big sedans of the brand. The new EQS also has a standard AMG-line front bumper, further enhancing the car’s visual aesthetic.
Mercedes Benz EV Plans Might Be Wavering
Mercedes-Benz remains committed to going electric, but lately, it has pulled back on its EV plans. Recently, it admitted that it will keep making ICE vehicles, but it does plan for 50% of its sales to be fully electric by the end of the decade.
The interior is mostly the same, meaning, EQS drivers will still have the dashboard-spanning Hyperscreen taking up most of the interior. But, there have been minor tweaks to make the car even more luxurious than before. Mercedes-Benz has added a bit more padding to the rear seats and enshrouded the B-pillar rear air vents in chrome. All EQSs now have a rear seat with adjustable recline, but the ones in Pinnacle trim and the Executive Interior Package allow the front passenger seat to fold, and increase the rear bench’s recline ability to a full 37 degrees, up from 27 to 36 degrees on the standard EQS. The Executive Interior Package also adds rapid heating, a pair of pillows, and neck and shoulder heating.
Underneath, the battery is all new and has more energy. Mercedes-Benz claims the EQS is now rated for 118 kWh and can go farther, albeit it hasn’t shared the so-called updated range figures. The regenerative braking software has been recalibrated, too. The EQS now uses more regenerative braking, but will also periodically use its friction brakes so they can stay in good shape.
The official range, pricing, and specifications specific to our market will come before the 2025 EQS reaches dealerships in late 2024.

The Electric Mercedes G-Class Is Called G580 With EQ Technology,https://www.motor1.com/news/715396/mercedes-g580-eq-technology/,It debuts at Auto China this month together with several other premieres.,2024-12-25 09:04:10,"At long last, the electric Mercedes-Benz G-Class finally has a name. Contrary to reports indicating the off-roader would be the first model to drop the EQ branding, the two letters are sticking around. But rather than being called EQG like the concept, the production version will be known as the ""G580 with EQ Technology"" when it debuts this month at Auto China in Beijing.
Since it's called the ""G580,"" we can safely assume that it has more power than the G550. For the 2025 model year, the regular G-Class loses its V-8 in favor of a mild-hybrid, inline-six engine that makes 443 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. We reckon the electric G is not going to outpunch the AMG G63, which keeps the V-8 packing 577 hp and 627 lb-ft.
The electric G-Class is expected to have four motors—one at each wheel—and a battery capacity estimated at 100.0-kilowatt-hours. That should give it a range of over 200 miles, which isn’t ideal, but not surprising since it'll be a heavy SUV. An optional high-density battery pack benefitting from silicon anode chemistry is due in 2025. We also know it'll have 32-degree approach and 35-degree departure angles, along with 9.8 inches of ground clearance.
The G580 with EQ Technology won't be the first quad-motor EV from Mercedes since that title goes to the SLS AMG Electric Drive from 2012. It's going to need all the power it can get considering G brand boss Emmerich Schiller has said it'll weigh less than 7,716 pounds.
An updated EQS will also attend the 2024 Auto China where the luxury brand intends to unveil (takes a deep breath) the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance with a plug-in hybrid V-8 setup. Without going into details, the three-pointed star mentions new show premieres from Maybach and the E-Class lineup will be there as well.
We'll first see the GT63 S E Performance on April 20 during the AMG Brand Night Event in Shanghai during the Chinese F1 weekend while the electric G premieres on April 24. Auto China starts April 25 with the first press day.

The Updated 2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E Is Now Available For Online Order,https://insideevs.com/news/715506/update-mache-ford-2024-online/,"The updated Mach-E is quicker, has more range and the lineup is simpler.",2024-04-09 13:30:27,"Ford’s turning up the heat on its compact EV crossover, the Mustang Mach-E. Equipped with better charging times, more choices, and more range, Ford is setting up the car to fight hard against competitors like the Tesla Model Y.  Oh, and the internet-breaking Mach-E Rally edition is finally available for order.
For 2024, Ford’s updates to the Mustang Mach-E have been more related to under the skin, and trim streamlining, rather than a full visual update. The Mach E still comes in four trims, Select, Premium, GT, and now the new Mustang Mach-E Rally trim. The California Route-1 trim has been cut for 2024.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E is starting to pick up sales
The Ford Mustang Mach-E is a solid EV option, yet it has not sold nearly as well as cars like the Tesla Model Y. Price cuts, and now an update should help the Mach-E sell better.
All Mustang Mach-E trims get a bump in range, and improvement in charging ability, and the Performance upgrade-equipped models are even faster than before. Ford spokesperson Emma Berg says much of these improvements are directly due to Ford’s new in-house developed rear e-motor, which is now equipped on all Mach-E models for 2024. This new e-motor is lighter than the old one and has more torque (up to 100 ft-lbs more). Also, Ford’s improved powertrain control management allows for better charge times. This all sounds like a win for the Mustang Mach-E.
On paper, those changes appear to have paid off. The 2024 Mach-E gains a notable bump in range. Ford says that all Mach-E models have a 10 to 20-mile bump in range for 2024. The RWD Premium models now are comfortably above the magical 300-mile range threshold; at 320 miles, the new Mach E’s improved range should keep range anxiety at bay here.
Arguably, the most exciting updates to the Mustang Mach-E are its performance-oriented updates. The GT trim is no longer a two-tier affair, as the old GT Performance Edition package’s upgrades have just been standardized on the regular GT. Now, all GT models will have the sport seats, MagneRide Damping System, and Brembo brake calipers.
But, for 2024, there is a new Performance upgrade software upgrade that can make the GT model even faster than it already is. When installed on the Mach-E GT, it will slingshot the car from 0-60 in as little as 3.3 seconds, down from 3.8 seconds. Ford says is quicker than the Tesla Model Y Performance and the Porsche Macan 4 Electric. The quarter-mile happens in a blisteringly quick 11.8 seconds. This is all possible due to the new rear e-motor. When coupled with the front motor, the Mach-E can generate a staggering 700 ft-lbs of torque. This unlockable feature is either $995 when purchased alone, or $795 when purchased alongside the the new bronze appearance package, which is $1,995. Like other software-based upgrades, Ford says the upgrade can be purchased and seamlessly integrated at a later date.
The cream of the crop is now the Mustang Mach-E Rally. Basically, Ford’s taken the already good Mach-E GT (with the optional Performance Upgrade installed), raised it by an inch and decked it out with a fleet of rally-inspired off-road kit. These upgrades do take their toll on the range. The Mach-E Rally can only manage 265 miles, despite having the same battery as the range-leading, 320-mile range Mach-E Premium (RWD).
Pricing is simpler for 2024, too. The Mach-E standard range Select RWD trim starts at $41,890 and tops out at $48,890 for the extended-range AWD variant. The Mach-E Premium Standard range RWD starts at $45,890 and stops at $51,890 for the extended-range AWD model. The GT model is $55,890 not including options like the Bronze appearance package or the Performance upgrade. Finally, the Rally trim tops out at $61,890. All of these prices include the $1,895 destination fee. Unfortunately, the Mach-E does not qualify for the IRA’s EV tax credit when purchased, but it may qualify via a lease.
The 2024 Mustang Mach-E lineup is now available to order online.

"Elon Musk Says Tesla Robotaxi Will Be Revealed On August 8, 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/715166/elon-musk-posts-tesla-robotaxi-unveil-date/,"The news follows a report that a planned ""affordable Tesla"" project is dead.",2024-04-05 17:14:30,"After today's drama with Reuters announcing that the $25,000 affordable Tesla was dead, and CEO Elon Musk responding by saying that the report was a lie, there’s a new development. Just hours later, Musk posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the autonomous Tesla Robotaxi will be revealed on August 8, 2024.
It goes without mentioning that this is a monumental development. Its roots were sown in 2016 when Tesla first revealed plans to make a self-driving people carrier. Details have mostly been scarce. But a ""Robotaxi Concept"" featured in Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, along with some early sketches of a ""gen 3"" vehicle.
The Tesla Robotaxi is happening.
Elon Musk has raved about Tesla's robotaxi for years. A cutting-edge self-driving people carrier that would revolutionize mobility, in his view. It was also one of the reasons that investors were betting big on Tesla. We didn't know if it ever would become a reality, but now Musk has put a date on it. It's arriving this summer, folks.
According to the book, Musk was adamant about creating an autonomous robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel. But his deputies persuaded him to develop an affordable ""global car"" to drive the brand towards achieving a lofty 50% annual growth target, without challenging his stance.
We've known for a while that the robotaxi and the affordable mass-market EV have the same platform. But little is known about the overlap between the two in terms of design and engineering. With the robotaxi's reveal announced before the affordable Tesla, it's unclear if the latter will ever be a reality—especially since sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the low-cost family car has been scrapped.
Messaging from the company remains muddled and confusing. Two years ago, Tesla executives hinted that the affordable EV might arrive before the robotaxi. But the man at the top might have pulled rank to reverse that possibility.
Either way, Musk's big announcement was probably in response to the Reuters report from this morning. We don't know for sure, but soon after his post, Tesla stock climbed some 3% after dipping earlier in the day.
The next-generation Tesla would be critical for the company since investors have been weary about the brand's business lately. Tesla share prices have been down some 33% since the start of the year. The company's Q1 sales were largely underwhelming, showing the first negative decline in years. The threat of rivals catching up and cheap Chinese EVs penetrating the U.S. looms large.
To tackle this storm, several experts have said the $25,000 EV should have arrived even before the Cybertruck—a hulking steel triangle that isn't exactly designed to democratize EVs. But it seems like Musk is going ahead with the robotaxi plan. How that pans out for the brand is something we'll know in a few months.

"UPDATE: This 1.24 Million-Mile Tesla Model S Is On Its 14th Motor, Fourth Battery Pack",https://insideevs.com/news/699413/highest-mileage-tesla-model-s-3-batteries-14-motors/,It's the highest-mileage Tesla in existence.,2024-04-04 09:51:52,"It's hard to believe that there's a Tesla Model S out there with over 1.21 million miles (1.96 million kilometers) on its odometer, but indeed there is. And here it is.
The car, a 2014 Model S P85, has racked up 1.2 million miles so far, which works out to approximately 131,000 miles per year. Could you imagine driving that much? And doing so in an electric car, which naysayers often state can't go the distance?
(UPDATE: This Model S has now surpassed 2 million kilometers, which is about 1.24 million miles.)
Well, we think this car proves that EVs can be driven a significant amount of miles per year and that the charging infrastructure, at least in some parts of the world, can support high-mileage drives.
More High Mileage Teslas
Back in 2019, Elon Musk congratulated Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg, the owner of this particular Model S, which at the time had one million kilometers (621,371 miles) on its odometer. That seemed like a solid accomplishment but flash forward to today and the mileage has basically doubled.
The video embedded above is one of the first to feature Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg. Up until now, much of the info about Gemmingen-Hornberg's Model S was limited to tweets. As Watt Energy, the uploader of the video explains:
His car has 1.9 million km / or 1.18 million miles on the odometer at the time of filming and Hansjorg aims for more. There is little precise information about him online, mostly based on some older tweets or on assumptions of how he manages to put so many miles on his car. I went to Germany to meet Hansjörg directly and to find out the complete story firsthand from him!
There's a lot more to the story though. Gemmingen-Hornberg previously owned a Tesla Roadster. He managed to somehow rack up 400,000 miles on it, despite the lacking infrastructure at the time. He decided to buy the Model S shortly after it came out because it was roomier and more comfortable. However, he didn't buy a new Model S, but rather a used 2014 one with 18,641 miles on it.
Some early Tesla Model S EVs were known to have issues with their rear motors. This particular Tesla suffered from this. The rear motor was replaced thirteen times, so if we include the original that it came with, that's fourteen motors over the course of 1.2 million miles.
Most of the replacement motors were actually refurbished units and the problem there is that Tesla didn't know the real issue so it didn't know how to properly fix the motors. Some of these replacement motors failed very quickly. Some were covered under warranty, while others were not.
In regards to the vehicle's battery pack, it fared better than the motor. However, this Model S is currently on its fourth battery pack. Four batteries at 1.2 million miles mean that the average pack lasted some 300,000 and counting, which is actually a strong showing in our opinion.
More Battery Degradation And Charging Info
Gemmingen-Hornberg notes that he does take it easy in his Model S. He does not drive the car for long distances without giving it and himself a break. He says he only covers about 62 miles at a time before pausing for a while.
In regard to depleting and charging the battery, the Model S owner says he aims to recharge it when it drops down to 20 percent. He doesn't fully deplete the battery and also doesn't top it off.
The other aspects of the car, like the exterior and interior, have held up well. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into detail about other wear items like brakes, tires, and so on.
For starters, the owner is retired. He also likes to see the world by car. The Model S has been driven to Africa, Morocco, Sweden, Austria, and China. It seems that's only the beginning though. The Model S owner wants to continue driving the car and actually let go of his Lucid Air reservation so that the Model S can rack up even more miles.

Ford Delays EV Pickup And Three-Row Electric SUV To Focus On Hybrids,https://insideevs.com/news/714959/ford-delays-electric-three-row-suv-by-two-years/,Ford said the delay would allow the company to take advantage of advancements in battery technology.,2024-04-04 09:42:17,"Ford has delayed the plans to build its next-generation EVs. Production of the electric pickup codenamed ""Project T3"" has been postponed from 2025 to 2026. The three-row electric SUV, which Ford CEO Jim Farley once described as a ""personalized bullet train,"" is now slated to arrive by 2027, instead of 2025.
The Dearborn automaker said additional time was required to let the EV market mature. In the meantime, Ford said it would benefit from the ongoing advancements in battery technology.
More Delays At Ford
Ford's EVs are flying off the shelves, especially the Mustang Mach-E. But the brand is cautious about its next-generation line-up. As the EPA regulations now allow a more gradual transition to EVs, automakers are using this additional timeframe to let the market evolve.
Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EV and digital systems indicated last year that the family SUV would arrive by 2025 with 350 miles of range. It would be an Explorer-sized EV made in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. The electric pickup truck, meanwhile, will be made at the BlueOval City plant in West Tennessee.
The family SUV is not to be mixed with the Explorer that's currently on sale in Europe—that one is based on Volkswagen's modular electric drive toolkit, commonly known as the MEB platform. Ford's family SUV for North America will be based on a bespoke BEV native platform.
Production of the gas-powered Edge SUVs will end next month at the Ontario plant and it will undergo retooling to make the family SUV. However, the delay would extend the layoffs of some 2,700 workers.
""We value our Canadian workforce and appreciate that this delay will have an impact on the team. The company will work with Unifor [the labor union] to mitigate the impact the launch delay will have on its workforce at Oakville,"" Ford said in the announcement.
Ford said it would continue focusing on its existing line-up of gas, hybrid, PHEV and BEV line-up in the meantime, contingent on demand. There's also a range of affordable EVs on the way under what Ford calls a ""skunkworks"" project.
""We are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time,” Farley said. “Our breakthrough, next-generation EVs will be new from the ground up and fully software enabled, with ever-improving digital experiences and a multitude of potential services,” he added.
Currently, there are several three-row electric SUVs on sale in the U.S. Some options include the Tesla Model Y and X, the newly launched Kia EV9, the Rivian R1S and the Mercedes EQB and EQS SUVs.
Many more are in the pipeline, including the production version of Toyota's ""bZ large SUV"" concept that will be manufactured in Kentucky, the Volvo EX90, Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Lucid Gravity among others.

Abarth 600e Is A Formula-E Inspired 240 HP Electric Hot Hatch,https://insideevs.com/news/714560/abarth-fiat-600e-formulae-hatch/,Stellantis says this is the most powerful car to ever wear the Abarth badge.,2024-04-01 15:30:00,"We’ve known about Fiat’s (Abarth) pint-sized four-door hot EV for a short while, but the brand has blessed us this week with more photos and details. This 240-horsepower EV crossover is aimed at the heart of the ever-changing sport compact hatchback and crossover classes. Could it be North America bound?
The Abarth 600e is strikingly sporty. It has a big wing, chunky wheels, and fun graphics that make it look just as rowdy as its Abarth 500e sibling. All of the photos are from the 600e Scorpionissima, which is a purple-painted commemoration of Abarth’s 75th anniversary. Only 1949 units of this model will be produced.
Fiat Aims To Go Fully Electric
Fiat aims to go fully electric by 2030. In North America, the imported Fiat 500e is part of its new push to revitalize sales in North America. Fiat plans to grow its presence in North America with more models and nameplates from other parts of the world.
Like the standard Fiat 600e, the Abarth 600e uses the same e-CMP platform that underpins many small subcompact hatchbacks and crossovers in the Stellantis stable including the Opel Corsa, Jeep Avenger, and Peugeot 2008. But, Abarth has significantly turned up the heat. Gone is the 156 horsepower front motor, replaced with a much larger 240 horsepower unit. That extra power is managed via a mechanical limited-slip differential and formula-E-inspired tires. This is the most powerful EV Stellantis has introduced yet on the e-CMP platform, and the most powerful product to ever wear an Abarth badge.
Abarth has also released photos of the interior, too. Of course, it’s very similar inside to the standard 600e (and has shades of the Jeep Avenger), but Abarth-specific graphics and Alcantara add to the car’s sporty demeanor. The infotainment screen has special Abarth graphics.
It’s still very much up in the air if the Fiat (or Abarth) 600e is bound for North America. On paper, the 600e’s specifications could seem a bit iffy, the standard 600e is only good for 250 miles on the somewhat forgiving WLTP cycle from a relatively small 54 kWh battery. With the extra power and focus on performance, the Abarth 600e’s range will likely be even lower, for a car that doesn’t even sound all that powerful on paper.
However, power and range aren’t always the end-all, and be-all when it comes to creating a desirable EV. The Abarth 600e could be charming, most of its manufacturer photos show the car doing front-wheel-drive slides, indicating that Fiat and Abarth are aiming to create a fun-to-drive car. It even has the same external sound generator as the Abarth 500e, meant to inject some personality into the EV driving experience.
We do know that Fiat has plans to expand its US lineup sooner rather than later. Hopefully, the Abarth 600e, or something like it, will make its way here.

Volvo’s Last Diesel Car Is Headed Straight To A Museum,https://insideevs.com/news/714134/volvo-last-diesel-xc90/,Volvo just hit a major milestone on its path to electric-only sales by 2030.,2024-03-27 18:26:08,"Volvo just made its last car with a diesel engine, marking a big milestone in the Swedish company's march toward electric-only sales.
The vehicle, an XC90 SUV, rolled off the assembly line in Torslanda, Sweden and is headed to a Volvo museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, where the automaker is headquartered.
Volvo says goodbye to diesel
Volvo plans to pivot to electric-only sales by 2030. Look out for it to release two brand-new electric models in the U.S. this year: the EX30 compact SUV and the larger EX90.
Several of the world's automakers have pared back their electric ambitions in recent months, citing a slowdown in EV demand. Mercedes-Benz, for example, now aims for 50% of its sales to be electric or hybrid by 2030, five years later than it initially planned. Despite the doom and gloom hanging over the EV market over the last several months, the auto industry's zero-emission transition is chugging along when you take a longer view.
Milestones like Volvo's show exactly where things are heading thanks to tightening environmental regulations globally and growing consumer interest in EVs. Diesel cars took off in Europe, promising lower greenhouse gas emissions than ones powered by gasoline. However, diesel sales have steadily declined in recent years as EVs gained traction.
The majority of cars Volvo sold in Europe in 2019 ran on diesel, the automaker said. Now, hybrid and fully electric cars account for most of its European sales. The company's EV sales grew by 70% last year. Volvo aims to be an electric-only carmaker by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.
Those plans are taking shape in the U.S. with the help of two exciting new EVs coming this year. The EX30 is a compact SUV starting at roughly $35,000, cheaper than most EVs. The EX90 will provide an electric alternative to Volvo's best-selling XC90 midsize SUV.
Similarly, Dodge recently said goodbye to its bread-and-butter V8s, turning its focus to electric cars and more fuel-efficient six-cylinder engines.

"The 2025 Volkswagen ID.7 Gets Two Trims, Both RWD And AWD, For U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/714095/2025-volkswagen-id7-trims/,Still no word on pricing or range yet.,2024-03-27 17:00:29,"Volkswagen announced the offer structure for the 2025 ID.7 model in the United States, which will join the ID.4 in the second half of 2024.
The Volkswagen ID.7 will be positioned in the near-luxury sedan segment and offered in two trims—Pro S and Pro S Plus. There will be only one battery option (82 kilowatt-hours of total capacity) and two powertrain versions: rear-wheel drive and dual-motor, all-wheel drive.
Volkswagen expands EV lineup
Volkswagen's EV lineup in the U.S. currently consists of only the ID.4, but shortly, it will be joined by the ID.7 and ID. Buzz. This should allow the company to continue to increase all-electric car sales.
This means that there will be four main versions of the Volkswagen ID.7 on the market:
Pricing and EPA range estimates will be announced closer to launch in Q3 2024. What we do know is that in Europe, the 82-kWh battery gets up to 386 miles of WLTP range. In the U.S., the EPA Combined range might reach about 300 miles, at least in the RWD version. Meanwhile, prices potentially could start at under $60,000.
The AWD version with Volkswagen's latest APP 550 drive unit is expected to accelerate from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in 6.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 112 mph.
The Volkswagen ID.7 Pro S trim will come standard with ""an array of standard high-end features"", the company says. It includes 19-inch wheels, front and rear illuminated logos, and power-folding mirrors outside. Volkswagen mentions a five-door KESSY keyless access with proximity unlocking and a power tailgate.
The paint color palette includes Mythos Black, Glacier White, Moonstone Grey, Aquamarine Blue, and Kings Red.
Inside, there is a 15-inch infotainment display and augmented reality head-up display, 12-way adjustable heated front seats with massage and memory (the steering wheel is heated too), and a panoramic glass roof with electrochromic dimming. Volkswagen mentions smart air vents and three-zone Climatronic automatic climate control.
Two interior colors are available:
In terms of safety, all ID.7 will get the Volkswagen’s IQ.DRIVE advanced driver assistance technology (hands-on semi-automated capability, including driver-initiated lane changes) as standard. Park Distance Control, Park Assist Plus with Memory Parking, and Area View features are also standard.
The higher trim level—Pro S Plus—adds some more features, like 20-inch wheels, DCC adaptive damping, and dynamic steering, as well as premium massage Climatronic seats, with a new automatic heating and ventilation function and an upgraded massage function.
There is a 700-watt Harman Kardon sound system boasting 14 speakers, including a front-center speaker and a trunk-mounted subwoofer.

Ford Explorer EV Goes On Sale In Europe With Up To 374 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/713990/ford-explorer-ev-europe-price/,"The MEB-based crossover is cheaper than a Mustang Mach-E. Oh, and it was also driven around the world.",2024-03-27 08:30:02,"The all-new, all-electric Ford Explorer can now be bought in Europe with prices starting from around €47,000. And yes, we know there’s also a completely different and much more expensive combustion-powered Ford Explorer for sale in Europe and the United States, but that’s just how Ford rolls, we guess.
Based on Volkswagen’s MEB architecture, the battery-powered crossover is roughly the same size as an ID.4 and about €5,000 cheaper than the Mustang Mach-E, although the Mach-E is 8.5 inches longer than the electric Explorer. Ford's European-bound electric crossover is also the first EV to drive around the world with Instagram travel guru Lexie Alford (@lexielimitless) at the wheel.
The battery-powered Ford Explorer goes on sale after traveling around the world
The all-electric Ford Explorer, which has nothing in common with the combustion-powered Explorer sold in the United States, is now for sale in Europe. Billed as a solid, dependable EV after driving around the world, the Explorer EV can be had with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and has a WLTP-rated range of up to 374 miles on a full charge.
That’s a pretty impressive feat for a car that should have been put on sale last year but a new European standard for electric vehicles postponed the market launch by about six months. The record-setting drive began and ended in the French coastal town of Nice, with the battery-powered Explorer passing through 27 countries and covering over 30,000 kilometers (18,641 miles).

European customers can choose between two powertrain options. There’s an extended-range rear-wheel drive Explorer that comes with a 77-kilowatt-hour (usable) battery pack and a single electric motor that makes 210 kilowatts (281 horsepower). This version has a maximum WLTP-rated range of 374 miles (601 km) and can draw up to 135 kW from a compatible DC fast charger.
The second powertrain option has a 79-kWh battery and a dual-motor drivetrain that’s capable of 250 kW (335 hp), while the maximum DC charging speed is 185 kW. The maximum WLTP range for the AWD version is 351 miles (566 km).
Both versions have an on-board AC charger that can accept up to 11 kW and Ford says that the Explorer EV will be available with a single-motor RWD trim that’s powered by a standard-range battery in the future, although the battery capacity wasn’t disclosed.
The Explorer EV starts at €49,500 in Germany, €51,765 in Spain, and €46,900 in France. It comes as standard with a heated steering wheel and front seats, massaging driver’s seat, wireless phone charging, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The two-row crossover can tow up to 2,654 pounds and has approximately 16.5 cubic feet of storage space inside.

Volkswagen R Wants to Be an Independent Brand and Launch Hot EVs,https://www.motor1.com/news/713819/volkswagen-r-independent-brand/,R is getting a dedicated section at VW's theme park in Wolfsburg.,2024-12-25 09:04:18,"Volkswagen R started in 2002 with the Golf R32. Then the Passat R sedan/wagon came along in 2008, followed a year later by the Scirocco R, while the Polo R WRC landed in 2013. In recent years, ""R"" has even been used for hot versions of the Arteon and T-Roc, Tiguan, and Touareg SUVs. But in 2024, VW wants R to evolve into an independent brand.
The plan is to open a dedicated Volkswagen R section at the Autostadt theme park in Wolfsburg. If you haven't been there already, it’s a visitor attraction located near the company’s factory, similar in philosophy to the BMW Welt in Munich. Annually, about two million people visit the Autostadt and its multiple pavilions dedicated to VW Group brands, from Skoda and SEAT to Audi and Lamborghini. An R pavilion spanning 1,076 square feet will join them this summer.
Fans of hot VWs will have the opportunity to check out concept cars and limited-run production models. Inevitably, there will be electric performance models on display. VW says the R lineup will gradually evolve in the coming years with amped-up EVs in the works. The process has already started with the Touareg R—complete with a plug-in hybrid V-6 powertrain.
However, there's still life left in the ol' internal combustion engine. The Golf R facelift is coming out this summer but sadly without a manual gearbox. That won't be such a dealbreaker in Europe where the Mk8 was never offered with three pedals but the stick shift will be missed by enthusiasts in the US.
VW’s decision to distance R (originally called Volkswagen Individual GmbH) from the main brand started in 2020 when it became a separate business unit. Elsewhere within the VW Group, SEAT went a step further with its US-bound Cupra spin-off marque by introducing standalone models. Audi Sport is also a separate entity within Audi.
As to what the future entails, VW has said the ninth-gen Golf will be exclusively electric. Will that be the first electric R? Time will tell, but we're likely going to see an electric GTI first. Spicy EVs are already part of the company's portfolio since the GTX models have more power, including even the ID. Buzz GTX minivan.
In the meantime, R is doing better than ever as more than 35,000 cars were produced in 2023, a record for the brand. Since 2002, over 300,000 R-badged vehicles have been sold.

"Early Chevy Blazer EV Buyers Can Get Reimbursed Up To $6,520",https://insideevs.com/news/713354/chevrolet-blazer-ev-reimbursement/,Chevrolet dropped the price of its Blazer EV. Now it's offering early buyers some money to make up the difference.,2024-03-21 18:02:21,"General Motors is handing out checks to customers who bought its Chevrolet Blazer EV before a price cut earlier this month. That's according to Edmunds, which has the electric SUV in its long-term test fleet and got a letter in the mail from Chevrolet regarding the refunds.
Edmunds said it qualifies for $5,620 back, since the Blazer EV RS AWD it purchased got its base price chopped from $60,215 to $54,595. Customers who bought a Blazer LT AWD are eligible for up to $6,520 to make up for the discrepancy between old and new pricing.
The Chevrolet Blazer EV's rocky start
Chevy pulled the Blazer EV from the market late last year due to software issues that were first reported by InsideEVs. General Motors restarted sales earlier this month, cutting the Blazer's price by thousands across trims.
Customers who bought a 2024 Blazer EV before March 7 of this year qualify for reimbursements, the letter said. A GM spokesperson confirmed that the reimbursements reflect the difference in old versus new MSRPs. Chevrolet had said earlier this month that early customers would get reimbursed.
Shortly after launching the Blazer EV last year, GM pulled it from the market due to software issues that were first reported by InsideEVs. GM spent months working on a fix before ultimately restarting sales in early March with reduced pricing.
The reimbursement strikes us as an easy, relatively low-cost way for GM to make good with Blazer EV owners and show its early adopters that it won't leave them behind. Similarly, Ford issued refunds to Mustang Mach-E buyers after it cut prices last year. But not all automakers are so kind.
Tesla has issued numerous drastic price cuts over the last year or so without compensating customers. Lower prices are great for buyers. But they're not so great when the Tesla Model Y Long Range you bought for close to $70,000 is worth $20,000 less basically overnight.

Future BMW Electric Cars Will Have Bidirectional Charging,https://www.motor1.com/news/713239/bmw-bidirectional-charging-neue-klasse/,Neue Klasse models will power your household.,2024-12-25 09:04:20,"The Neue Klasse will be BMW's long-awaited dedicated electric car platform when it debuts next year with an SUV. Previewed today by the Vision Neue Klasse X concept, the architecture is bringing a handy feature that other automakers have had for years. Better late than never, the new wave of EVs with the famous white and blue roundel will support bidirectional charging.
That means the future iX3 SUV (2025) and i3 sedan (2026) will double as power banks to juice up your house, appliances, e-bikes, camping gear, and other products. While luxury automakers tend to charge (pun intended) you for just about everything, bidirectional charging is going to be standard on Neue Klasse-based models. Functions such as Vehicle to Home, Vehicle to Grid, and Vehicle to Load will all be supported without having to pay more.
While the current EVs and PHEVs use batteries with prismatic cells, the next wave of batteries will switch to round cells. BMW estimates that charging speed and range will increase by 30 percent, while energy density is going up by 20 percent. These sixth-generation batteries will power your toaster and whatnot.
BMW intends to roll out bidirectional charging in three stages, kicking off with Vehicle to Home for your household. Vehicle to Grid will follow, allowing the car's owner to feed the stored energy back into the network but only in countries where legislation allows it. Vehicle to Load will power external electrical equipment. Interestingly, the German luxury marque doesn't say anything about Vehicle to Vehicle to provide energy to another Neue Klasse EV.
After the launch of the iX3 and i3, BMW intends to launch at least four more models on the same underpinnings by 2028. By the end of the decade, the Munich-based marque projects more than half of its global annual sales will be represented by EVs. In the early 2030s, Mini and Rolls-Royce will go completely electric.

Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX Is A Hot Electric Van With 335 HP And AWD,https://insideevs.com/news/713137/vw-id-buzz-gtx-debut-specs-details-photos/,"VW’s go-fast people mover comes with a dual-motor setup, two wheelbase options, and two battery sizes.",2024-03-21 05:00:00,"The Volkswagen ID. Buzz is getting the GTX treatment.
Hot on the heels of the recently announced ID.3 GTX and ID.7 GTX, this souped-up battery-powered people carrier comes with all-wheel drive for the first time, courtesy of a dual-motor system, charging speeds of up to 200 kilowatts, and a maximum towing capacity of almost 4,000 pounds.
The new ID. Buzz GTX will be available in Europe with two wheelbase options, just like the regular versions, but unlike the bog standard modern Bulli, the GTX comes with two new batteries that are larger than those available on the non-GTX models.
VW launches its third GTX model in less than a month
The new Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX is the latest performance-oriented EV shown to the world by the German automaker after the ID.3 GTX and ID.7 GTX.
The new, hotter electric minivan is the most powerful ID. Buzz to date thanks to its dual-motor setup that makes 335 horsepower.
The standard-wheelbase ID. Buzz GTX packs a 79-kilowatt-hour (net) battery, while the long-wheelbase is powered by an 86-kWh battery. The smaller unit can accept up to 185 kW from a compatible DC charger and the larger pack can be recharged at up to 200 kW. By comparison, the non-GTX ID. Buzz can be fitted with either a 77-kWh pack or an 85-kWh unit and the maximum charging speed is 200 kW.
More Electric Minivans
Volkswagen doesn’t say how much range these new batteries can enable in the hot Buzz, but it did mention that no matter the pack, it can accelerate from zero to 62 miles per hour (0-100 kilometers per hour) in an estimated 6.5 seconds, while the top speed is limited at 99 mph (160 kph)
Power-wise, the new ID. Buzz GTX gets the same dual-motor setup as the recently unveiled ID.7 GTX. This means an APP550 permanent magnet synchronous motor that makes 210 kW (281 hp) at the rear and an AKA150 asynchronous motor that puts out 80 kW (107 hp) on the front axle. The total power output is rated at 250 kW (335 hp), making the hot minivan the most powerful ID. Buzz to date, with 40 kW (53 hp) more than the rear-wheel drive trims.
It’s also worth noting that the front electric motor is disengaged most of the time; it only kicks in when the traction control system detects wheel slip at the rear, which happens “within fractions of a second,” according to the German carmaker.
The towing capacity has been improved compared to the lesser models by up to 800 kilograms (1,763 pounds). The short Buzz GTX can tow up to 3,527 lbs, while the extended EV can pull up to 3,968 lbs.
Just like the regular ID. Buzz, the GTX can be had in either five- or six-seat configurations when getting the standard-wheelbase version, while the long-wheelbase model adds the option of a seven-seat layout. The cargo volumes also remain the same, with the five-seat SWB ID. Buzz GTX capable of carrying 1,121 liters (39.5 cubic feet) of stuff in the back with the rear seats in place, while the seven-seat LWB model can accommodate up to 306 l (10.8 cu ft) of cargo behind the third row.
Design-wise, the hot zero-emissions minivan comes with all the usual bells and whistles that we’ve come to expect from a GTX-branded EV. These include a redesigned front end with a new front bumper, black honeycomb grille, triangular-shaped LED daytime running lights, a bunch of plastic bits painted in high-gloss black, several GTX logos, and a new set of 19-inch alloy wheels.
The body of the ID. Buzz GTX is painted as standard in Cherry red, but Volkswagen will also offer si more solid color options, as well as five dual-tone paint finishes.
Inside, the EV features a black headliner–the only ID. Buzz to do so–GTX-specific seat designs, red cross-stitching on the steering wheel, and a few GTX badges here and there. It also comes with VW’s latest hardware and software for the infotainment system, which means the ID. Buzz GTX has a 12.9-inch touchscreen on the center console that’s a little bit easier to use than the previous iteration found on older ID models.
Furthermore, the ""IDA"" virtual voice assistant integrates with the internet-famous artificial intelligence bot known as ChatGPT to answer questions more naturally by using basically the whole internet as its source of information.
The souped-up electric people mover can be optionally specced with the biggest panoramic sunroof ever fitted on a Volkswagen. It integrates a liquid crystal film that can make the glass transparent or opaque at the flick of a switch.
On the safety side of things, the ID. Buzz GTX is fitted with an exit warning system that can warn and even briefly prevent a door from opening if it detects that a vehicle or bicycle approaches from behind. Travel Assist, which includes Lane Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Emergency Assist is available on the GTX, and VW says it’s now more responsive and smoother than ever.
Volkswagen will start taking orders for the new ID. Buzz GTX in the European Union this summer, with deliveries slated for the second half of the year. In the United States, the hot Buzz feels unlikely to make an appearance, seeing how the performance sub-brand has so far been a European-only affair.
That said, the U.S. will get the LWB rear-wheel drive ID. Buzz toward the end of the year, and maybe–just maybe–an all-wheel drive version will make its way stateside sooner rather than later.",Iulian Dnistran
The New Three-Row Peugeot 5008 Has Hybrid and Electric Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/713069/2024-peugeot-5008-reveal-specs/,The boxy SUV gets a 21-inch screen and a striking front fascia.,2024-12-25 09:04:22,"The third-generation Peugeot 5008 plugs into Europe's already crowded SUV segment in more ways than one. It's available with a fully electric drivetrain but you can also have the three-row family hauler with a plug-in hybrid setup. Alternatively, the French brand part of Stellantis plans to sell a cheaper mild-hybrid model as well.
Essentially, the new 5008 is an enlarged version of the latest 3008 introduced in 2023. It sits on the STLA Medium platform and has the following dimensions: 188.5 inches long, 74.4 inches wide, and 66.5 inches tall, with a generous wheelbase of 114.1 inches. One major advantage it has over the Tesla Model Y sold in Europe is the availability of a third row.
You can imagine there's not much cargo space left with all seven seats in place, but 9.1 cubic feet should suffice for short trips around town. In the five-seat configuration, the luggage capacity jumps to 26.4 cubic feet. Should you need even more, you can fold the second row as well and unlock a cavernous 64.0 cubic feet.
While SUVs nowadays tend to have swoopy rooflines, the new Peugeot 5008 retains the boxy shape of its predecessor to maximize interior space. It largely inherits the design of its E-3008 smaller brother, complete with the same 21-inch display positioned atop the dashboard. There are also 10 customizable touch controls providing shortcuts to often-used functions accessible from the center console.
The most affordable version will be powered by a turbocharged 1.2-liter gasoline engine fitted with 48V technology. This tiny three-cylinder mill sends 136 horsepower to the front wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission featuring a built-in electric motor.
Should you need more oomph, the plug-in hybrid combines a 150-hp combustion engine with a 123-hp electric motor for a total system output of 195 hp channeled through a seven-speed, dual-clutch auto. This PHEV can cover more than 50 miles on electric power before the gas engine starts feeding from the 15.8-gallon fuel tank.
Then there’s the fully electric E-5008 model available in multiple configurations. The single-motor, front-wheel-drive versions come with 210 hp and 228 hp, both of which offer an instant torque of 254 pound-feet. Step up to the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model, and the combined output is rated at 318 hp.
Stick to the front-wheel-drive model and Peugeot installs a 73.0-kilowatt-hour battery good for 311 miles. The bigger 98.0-kWh pack means fewer stops at a charging station since the range grows to 410 miles. The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version gets the bigger battery but efficiency takes a hit due to the vehicle's higher curb weight.
Those batteries are guaranteed for eight years or 100,000 miles during which Peugeot is sure charging capacity won't drop below 70 percent. A heat pump comes as standard, as does the 11-kW charger. You can optionally get a 22-kilowatt charger, while DC charging can support up to 160 kW. In this case, it takes 10 minutes to put enough energy in the battery for 62 miles. Spending half an hour at a charging station replenishes the battery from 20 to 80 percent.
In recent years, Stellantis has ruled out a return for Peugeot to North America but that STLA Medium platform is likely to underpin a series of US-bound electric models.

2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC Plug-In Hybrid Lands In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/713188/2025-mercedes-glc-phev/,The most popular Mercedes-Benz car in the U.S. gets an electrified addition as PHEVs gain traction.,2024-03-20 16:00:03,"Mercedes-Benz is expanding its SUV line-up here in the U.S. The GLC, the best-selling car in the U.S. with a three-pointed badge will now get a plug-in hybrid edition. Say hello to the 2025 GLC 350e.
The most interesting aspect of this new variant is its drivetrain. In addition to its 2-liter four-cylinder gas engine, the GLC 350e gets a 24.8 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery that powers a 135-horsepower electric motor, resulting in a combined system output of 313 hp. The e-motor also produces an impressive 325 pound-foot of torque (406 lb-ft combined).
PHEVs gain traction in the U.S.
Just like battery electric cars, plug-in hybrids also had a record sales year in the U.S. in 2023. As the U.S. moves away from gas cars, PHEVs make sense for those concerned about range and charging infrastructure, while still reaping some of the advantages of driving an EV.
The plug-in hybrid system allows an electric-only range of 81 miles on the WLTP cycle—we know that’s an overly optimistic figure. The EPA range would likely be in the 50-60 miles range. But credit where it's due, that’s still enough to satisfy your average daily driving needs, and it seems to be more than what the competition offers.
You can drive the GLC 350e at speeds up to 87 miles per hour on battery power only. In terms of charging, you can plug it in at home with an 11-kilowatt AC charger. But it also supports up to 60 kW of fast charging, which will fully charge the battery in 30 minutes. There's up to 100 kW of recuperation capacity from the energy recovery system.
Whether you’re buying a Mercedes, plug-in hybrid, or not, you’re of course expecting to indulge in some of the luxury goodies. The GLC 350e won’t deprive you of those.
Standard features-wise, everything on the GLC 300 will carry over to the GLC 350e. There will be three trim levels on offer: Standard, Exclusive, and Pinnacle. You can choose from 13 upholstery options, while key interior features include heated and 16-way power-adjustable front seats, ambient lighting, adaptive headlamps, wireless Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay among several other items. The top trim also gets digital light projections and insulated glass.
PHEVs serve as a halfway house between gas cars and pure electric models, allowing customers to feel how electric drive works, and hopefully learn some of the charging and battery preservation techniques. But don’t forget to plug it in—because if not, you’re just burning more fuel by lugging a heavy battery around.
The GLC 350e will join a growing crop of plug-in vehicles as manufacturers and consumers embrace the technology increasingly. It will join the likes of the Audi Q5 55 TFSI e, BMW X5 xDrive45e, and Ford Escape PHEV among several others. Pricing will be announced closer to launch in the second half of 2024.

"The New Audi A5, Q5, And A6 E-Tron Confirmed For 2024 Reveal",https://www.motor1.com/news/713087/audi-a5-q5-a6-e-tron-coming-2024/,More than 20 new models are due by late 2025.,2024-12-25 09:04:34,"It's only March, but Audi has already introduced several new products. It started with the updated Q7 in late January before the RS6 Avant GT arrived in early February. The revised S3 debuted a few days later, followed by the normal A3 facelift last week. The first-ever Q6 E-Tron joined the fray a few days ago. But there's much more to come later this year.
The 154-page Audi Report 2023 document mentions more than 20 new products will hit the market before the end of next year. Leading the way will be the A6 E-Tron (pictured above in prototype guise). It's arriving in the following months as a fully electric model based on the Premium Platform Electric. The PPE hardware has been co-developed with Porsche and has already underpinned the Q6 E-Tron and Macan. The new A6 E-Tron will be sold as a sedan (well, it'll technically be a five-door hatchback) and as a wagon.
In the year's second half, Audi will take the wraps off the next-generation A5 lineup and the Q5. These models will ride on what the Four Rings refers to as the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), which will be an evolution of the VW Group's existing MLB architecture. The German luxury brand doesn't mention the A4 at all, and that's because it's going away.
The A4 we know today will become the A5, leaving room in the lineup for a future electric-only A4 E-Tron. Audi doesn't say whether there will be another sedan in this segment with combustion engines or whether the A5 Sportback will supersede the A4 Sedan. Spy shots have revealed the wagon will live to see another generation, so prepare for A5/S5/RS5 Avant models to be offered alongside the Sportback.
Car paparazzi haven't seen any prototypes of an A5 coupe or a convertible but here's hoping the two-door models are still planned. That said, the segment is shrinking, which is why Mercedes has fused the C-Class and E-Class coupe and convertible models to create the CLE.
The Q5 will enter its third generation in 2024, and just like the upcoming A5, it's getting a new family of ""highly efficient"" combustion engines with plug-in hybrid power. These will be the last ICE developments from Audi since the brand intends to launch its final cars with conventional powertrains in 2026. Every new launch after will be an EV because the company wants to go purely electric by the end of 2033.
Meanwhile, here are some of the other models we think are coming out by late 2025. There should be a Q3 compact crossover successor, a facelifted RS3 hot hatch/sedan duo, a Q6 E-Tron Sportback with a rakish roofline, an electric A8 sedan replacement, and a Q9 three-row SUV.
The A1 and Q2 won't be renewed as Audi has announced that these models will be retired at the end of their life cycle. The TT suffered the same fate last year when it was discontinued, with the R8 facing an imminent death as well.

Bentley Delays First EV Due To Software Problems,https://www.motor1.com/news/712921/bentley-first-electric-vehicle-delayed/,It's also pushing back the goal to become electric-only from 2030 to 2033.,2024-12-25 09:04:34,"Bentley intended to introduce its first electric model in 2025—but that's not happening. CEO Adrian Hallmark told Automotive News Europe the EV has been delayed by a year because of technical problems caused by software issues as well as ""platform-related concerns."" Crewe's inaugural EV is now expected to break cover near the end of 2026, but customer deliveries won't start until 2027.
Separately, Autocar has learned Bentley is also pushing back its goal to become entirely electric by the end of the decade. According to the new agenda, the ultra-luxury British brand wants to completely get rid of gasoline cars by 2033. The three-year delay will allow the company to invest more in plug-in hybrids to provide a smoother transition to an EV-only lineup early into the next decade.
The inaugural EV is going to be manufactured at home in the UK and will be underpinned by the Premium Platform Electric co-developed by Porsche and Audi. The first PPE-based models have been recently revealed as the second-generation Macan in January and the Q6 E-Tron earlier this week. While all three brands sit underneath the Volkswagen Group umbrella, Audi technically owns Bentley (as well as Lamborghini and Ducati) since 2022.
The decision to delay the EV isn't surprising. The Macan and Q6 E-Tron were also supposed to arrive sooner, per the original announcements. Before the first zero-emission model arrives, Bentley is preparing to launch a high-performance plug-in hybrid setup based around a V-8. It'll indirectly replace the venerable W-12, which is sadly going away with the 740-horsepower Batur.
The company's head honcho admits Bentley had estimated demand for hybrids would decrease closer to the end of the decade, but it's now expected to rise. Consequently, the high-end automaker is pouring ""hundreds of millions"" into a new wave of PHEVs that'll remain on sale early into the next decade to meet demand.
We'll be seeing that punchy V8 PHEV setup in the GT, GTC, and Flying Spur later in 2024. The current V-6 PHEV is staying while the Bentayga will retain its pure gasoline powertrain until 2026 when the posh SUV is set to become electric-only.
The now-delayed EV won't replace an existing model as it'll be a completely different product. When it does arrive, it's getting a hotter Speed version touted as ""the W12 of batteries"" with electric motors developed to deliver 50 to 100 percent more power than ICEs. For now, the most potent model on this PPE platform is the Porsche Macan Turbo with 630 hp and 833 pound-feet of torque.
The batteries that will go inside Bentley's first EV will have enough juice for 350 to 450 miles on a single charge, according to a statement made last year by Hallmark. It'll take less than 20 minutes to replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent.
For the time being, the Bentayga is the undisputed sales king with a 44-percent share of the total volume in 2023. The Continental GT/GTC is next with 31 percent while the Flying Spur occupies the last spot on the podium with a 25-percent share. In 2023, total deliveries dropped by 11 percent to 13,560 units.

"The 2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron In-Car Tech: PlugShare, Video Games, OTA Updates And More",https://insideevs.com/news/712859/audi-q6-etron-tech-impressions/,"After several delays, the Volkswagen Group says its software revolution is ready for prime time. We try it out on the new Audi Q6 E-Tron.",2024-03-18 14:00:00,"Audi invited me to take the new 2025 Q6 and SQ6 E-Tron for a couple of spins at its test track near Munich. You honestly can’t learn all that much from such a brief drive in a controlled environment, but my first impressions are positive.
The SUV’s interior feels just as sturdy and high-quality as you’d expect from an Audi. Both models handled confidently enough through corners, particularly in “Dynamic” mode, which stiffened up the suspension. The Q6’s regenerative braking blended smoothly into regular, mechanical braking. A handy graphic on the SUV’s central screen indicated when that transition was happening and which axle was responsible for regenerative braking at any given moment, which was neat.
I got a lot more time to poke around a stationary Q6’s infotainment system, which is a standout feature.
(Full Disclosure: To make sure InsideEVs got a preview of the Q6 E-tron, Audi flew me out to Germany, put me up in a hotel and fed me schnitzel in large quantities.)
The VW Group has had many software delays
Software is a consistent challenge for automakers who envision a future powered by wireless updates, new downloadable features, bug fixes and, of course, revenue. The software in the new Audi Q6 E-Tron suffered from numerous delays, but the Volkswagen Group says it's ready for deployment now. It's key to the conglomerate's future EV programs, so it had better work right.
The Q6 gets a sprawling 14.5-inch central touchscreen and an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster, which are both housed behind the same curved piece of glass that’s canted toward the driver. The idea was to envelop the driver without overwhelming him or her, Audi says. And I think it pulled that off. The Q6 E-Tron is also Audi’s first vehicle to offer a third display for the front passenger.
What’s perhaps more important is the software powering those many screens. The Q6’s new, Android Automotive-based infotainment system—a first for Audi—was remarkably satisfying to use and responsive to taps, swipes and scrolls. All in all, playing around with the Q6’s dual touchscreens felt more like using a silky-smooth tech product than a typical automotive infotainment system.
Audi chose Android because it’s a familiar platform to app developers, spokesperson Stefan Grillneder said. At launch, the Audi app store will have 40 apps to choose from—like Zoom, YouTube, a web browser and a racing game called Beach Buggy Racer—but the company expects to offer a wider selection over time. It envisions that games and other entertainment apps could help owners pass the time while charging.
The Q6 I poked around was loaded with PlugShare, the famously helpful charging station locator. Video games might get old after a while, but that sort of integration strikes me as a total no-brainer.
Audi is also introducing a more advanced voice assistant that I found impressively responsive. While the Audi Assistant doesn't integrate ChatGPT like Volkswagen's latest voice control offering, it does use AI to understand more prompts than previous systems. The feature can respond to more than 800 commands, Audi says, and suggest things based on a driver's past actions. For example, it might recommend the butt warmer if it notices that a driver tends to switch it on in certain weather.
I asked the Audi Assistant to switch drive modes, route me to the nearest fast-charging station and open all the windows a crack, and it obliged without hesitation.
As such, the Q6 E-Tron represents a leap forward in the Volkswagen Group’s digital transformation. The company, like most automakers, envisions cars that are deeply computerized, filled with powerful software and endlessly updatable. The Q6 E-Tron debuts E3 1.2, VW’s latest electronics and software architecture developed by Cariad, its software division. (That will also come on the Porsche Macan, a close relative of the Q6.)
“What you have to keep in mind is that this is the most ambitious and the most performant electronics architecture that the VW Group has ever developed,” a Cariad spokesperson told InsideEVs.
In the new Audi, five computers control all major vehicle functions—from the infotainment screens to driver assistance systems to battery management. Traditionally, each individual component or sensor in a car—from the seat controls to the radar system—had its own discrete computer module and software. Those dozens of control units couldn’t communicate with each other or receive software updates. That’s what automakers like VW are moving away from, following Tesla’s lead toward vehicles that function more like tech products.
E3 1.2 introduces a vastly more capable and centralized computing system than VW previously had, Cariad representatives said. Previous architectures allowed for limited software updates to things like the navigation system or other application data, they said. Thanks to E3 1.2, Audi can dig deep into a vehicle to improve things, fix bugs or offer new paid features.
Importantly, the Q6 E-Tron is Audi’s first vehicle that will receive over-the-air software updates. (Before, Audi offered “functions on demand,” features owners could pay for, but not a stream of regular software updates, which Tesla pioneered.)
Updatability is a big benefit of E3 1.2. The new setup should also help the Q6 function better, Audi says. For one, more processing power allowed Audi to enhance the size and resolution of its infotainment screens. A Cariad spokesperson said that having all the driving dynamics handled by a single computer—a VW first—should boost performance.
Cariad has suffered delays and executive shakeups in getting its software into production, so all eyes will be on E3 1.2 as the Q6 rolls out to customers. We’re looking forward to getting our hands on a Q6 E-Tron as soon as we can and rendering a more complete review.

2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron: Audi’s High-Tech Flagship Has Arrived,https://insideevs.com/news/712853/2025-audi-q6-etron-debut/,Audi's new 300-mile electric SUV showcases a bunch of brand-new technology and aims straight at the extremely popular Tesla Model Y.,2024-03-18 14:00:00,"Audi isn’t letting an itty-bitty slowdown in the growth of EV sales derail its pivot to becoming an electric-only automaker. On Monday, the German luxury brand unveiled the latest and perhaps most crucial step yet in its electric efforts: the 2025 Q6 E-Tron.
Arriving in the extremely popular form factor of a midsize SUV, the Q6 E-Tron aims straight at the heart of American car-buying. It uses an all-new battery-and-motor platform that will undergird a host of future Audis and Porsches. It's a mechanical sibling to the new Porsche Macan, which is already making waves and isn't even out yet.
And it debuts the Volkswagen Group’s next-generation electrical and software architecture, showcasing the fruits of an effort that’s been notoriously fraught and slow-going.
Audi's technological spearhead
Audi, a subsidiary of the enormous Volkswagen Group, has been selling EVs since the 2019 launch of the E-Tron SUV (now called the Q8 E-Tron). The Q6 E-Tron uses all-new technology and aims at the extremely popular midsize SUV segment.
No pressure, right?
Audi isn’t shunning gasoline just yet. But the Q6 is a key part of Audi’s strategy to offer an EV in all “core” vehicle segments by 2027. And once its next generation of combustion-powered live out their days—around 2033—the brand will be all-electric.
If there’s one model that can bring buyers to electric Audis en masse and help usher in that future, it’s the Q6 E-Tron.
InsideEVs went to Germany last week to get the lowdown on the Q6 E-Tron from Audi’s engineers and drive the new SUV, albeit very briefly. So let’s dive in.
(Full Disclosure: To make sure InsideEVs got a preview of the Q6 E-tron, Audi flew me out to Germany, put me up in a hotel and fed me schnitzel in large quantities.)
The Q6 E-Tron arrives in the U.S. in late 2024 with two variants to start: the Q6 E-Tron Quattro and the sportier SQ6 E-Tron. It slots in between the compact Q4 E-Tron SUV and the Q8 E-Tron, a full-size family-hauler. The E-Tron GT, a sports sedan that’s a fraternal twin to the Porsche Taycan, rounds out Audi’s electric portfolio.
Unlike any of those models, the Q6 E-Tron rides on Audi’s new Performance Platform Electric (PPE) platform, which can be configured to fit a range of different sedans and SUVs from both Audi and Porsche. That new tech allows for excellent range, charging speeds and performance, Audi says. On paper at least, that seems to be the case.
Both the Q6 Quattro and SQ6 come equipped with dual motors in front and rear and all-wheel drive. The Quattro claims a peak of 456 horsepower and hits 60 mph in roughly five seconds, Audi says. The SQ6 churns out 510 horses and rips to 60 in 4.2 seconds. Unlike the upcoming PPE-equipped Porsche Macan Electric, the Q6 E-Tron has an asynchronous motor up front and a permanent magnet motor in the rear. That allows the Audi to disengage its front motor to slash energy consumption when needed.
A 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack nestled in the Q6 E-Tron’s floor will deliver more than 300 miles of EPA range in the Quattro, according to Audi’s internal estimates. That’s more than any Audi EV before it.
Pricing is still a question mark, but that range figure should make the Q6 E-Tron competitive, in at least one crucial metric, with the vehicles Audi has identified as its biggest rivals. Those rivals include the Mercedes-Benz EQB, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Nio EC6 and EL6 (from a Chinese startup) and, of course, the Tesla Model Y, the world’s best-selling EV.
It's worth noting that the new all-electric Macan, of which the Q6 E-Tron is a close relative, jumped nearly $20,000 in price over the old gas-powered Macan. Porsche is arguing it's worth it for the performance increase here, but it's unclear how Audi will round this out.
A rear-wheel-drive version coming down the pike (with the same 100 kWh battery but one motor instead of two) should offer quite a bit more mileage and will be the choice for Audi buyers who want absolute maximum range. A high-performance RS variant as well as a  Sportback version, Audi's name for a fastback, are in the works too. Timing on those is TBA.
The brand is touting some impressively quick charging speeds, too. Thanks to an 800-volt architecture (like Audi already uses in the E-Tron GT), the Q6 will be able to accept a veritable firehose of electrons: 270 kilowatts of charging power to be exact. There aren’t too many EVs on the market that can match that. Along with the new Porsche Taycan, it should be a charging-speed monster.
When plugged into a sufficiently powerful plug (rated at 270 kW or higher), the Q6 E-Tron can recharge from 10-80% state of charge in 21 minutes, Audi says. Assuming a total range of 300 miles, that maths out to a solid 210 miles of potential driving.
Interestingly, when using a charger that doesn’t operate at 800 volts, the Q6 E-Tron flips a switch that divides its pack into two 400-volt sections. Those then charge simultaneously at 135 kW, slashing charging times at less powerful stations. Under those circumstances, 10-80% should happen in 30 minutes, Audi says.
The question on everybody’s mind: Does it get a NACS plug?
Although Audi plans to move over to Tesla’s North American Charging Standard eventually, the Q6 E-Tron will come with the conventional Combined Charging System (CCS) port at launch. Audi isn’t ready to announce when its new cars will get NACS from the factory or how it will roll out adapters for Tesla’s charging stations, Audi spokesperson Mark Dahncke said, explaining that there’s still testing to be done to make Audis work with Tesla’s infrastructure.
(Some background, in case you need it: Most automakers have announced plans to shift from CSS, the old charging-plug standard, to NACS, which historically was only equipped on Tesla’s cars and at its Supercharger stations. Now, car companies have struck deals to use Tesla’s plug design and, therefore, much of its charging network.)
Audi hasn’t announced pricing for U.S.-bound models yet, but the base MSRPs of the Q4 E-Tron ($55,200) and Q8 E-Tron ($74,400) offer some clues. The Q6 E-Tron is expected to fall somewhere right in the middle, perhaps in the mid-$60,000 realm.
The Q6 is just one possibility derived from the PPE platform. In broad strokes, the idea was to develop a platform that could deliver high performance, lots of range, fast charging and excellent efficiency—all while being simple to produce at scale.
It bridges the gap between the Volkswagen Group’s MEB platform, which is for lower-end vehicles and doesn’t offer particularly high performance, and the J1 platform, which is used by the high-end E-Tron GT and Porsche Taycan.
Part of achieving all that involved developing more lightweight and efficient motors. The PPE platform supports three different motors for the front axle and two for the rear, all of which can be manufactured on the same production line.
Compared to Audi’s first-generation rear drive unit, the PPE’s rear motor is 62% more power-dense and 50% more energy-efficient, Audi says.
The PPE’s battery pack uses a new chemistry for Audi and large prismatic cells co-developed with the Chinese battery maker CATL. Bigger cells mean this Audi can pack more active material into a given area, boosting energy density. Individual cells are stacked into modules, allowing for different battery capacities. For example, the 83 kWh Q6, which will be sold outside the U.S., has essentially the same pack as the 100 kWh version, just with two modules poked out of its center.
Audi says the new, simpler layout allows it to assemble batteries faster and with more automation than before. To put things into perspective, the Q8 E-Tron’s battery pack comprises 36 modules and 432 cells. The Q6’s battery is made up of 12 modules with 180 total cells.
Audi also did a lot of work on thermal management, building improved systems that heat or cool the PPE battery to the optimal temperature for charging and driving. New to the Q6 is what Audi calls “continuous” thermal management. In extreme temperatures, the Q6 will automatically regulate its internal temperature to preserve battery longevity, even when it’s parked.
But the hardware specs are only part of the mission here. The new Audi Q6 E-Tron is a huge deal on the software and UX side too, which we'll cover in a separate story. In the meantime, do you think this Audi is shaping up to be as promising a contender in the EV crossover space as the Macan is? Let us know in the comments.

The Skoda Epiq Has A Pompous Name But It's Just Another Electric Crossover,https://www.motor1.com/news/712518/skoda-epiq-concept-debut/,"The production version is coming in 2025 and will cost the equivalent of $27,000.",2024-12-25 09:04:36,"Skoda intends to launch six EVs by 2026, and the most affordable of the bunch will be this pretentiously named Epiq. It’s scheduled to go on sale next year with a targeted starting price of €25,000, or roughly $27,000 at current exchange rates. Touted as being ""small but epic,"" the brand's entry-level EV will be among the first models to embrace the fresh ""Modern Solid"" design language.
At around 4.1 meters (161.4 inches) long, you can think of it as an electric alternative to the Kamiq. However, the subcompact Skoda Epiq is destined to ride on a dedicated EV platform, likely the MEB Entry the Volkswagen Group has already announced. The architecture has been previewed by the German automotive conglomerate with last year's ID.2all concept. While VW is going the hatchback route, Skoda is cooking up this crossover.
Even though it's shorter than the Kamiq we mentioned earlier, it's far more practical. The cargo capacity of 490 liters (17.3 cubic feet) is more than 20 percent higher thanks to the dedicated EV underpinnings, resulting in better packaging. The Czech marque remains tight-lipped about the other technical specifications, but it does say the unspecified battery pack is good for over 249 miles (400 kilometers) of range, presumably in the WLTP cycle.
The MEB Entry platform is intended for EVs with front-wheel drive whereas the regular MEB used by the bigger Enyaq comes with rear-wheel drive. The more expensive and powerful MEB-based models sold by the VW Group come with AWD by adding a front motor. It remains to be seen whether the MEB Entry models will get an all-paw setup at some point.
The Modern Solid design language per Skoda's marketing jargon will toughen up the appearance of future models. This Epiq has plastic body cladding around the wheel arches and unpainted sections of the rear bumpers. We also notice a pair of nifty roof rails, an illuminated rear badge, and slim lights at both ends.
The charging port is mounted on the front fender rather than at the back as is the case with the Enyaq. Contrasting orange accents are found inside and out, along with an interrupted light bar that goes across the wide grille. Overall, the Epiq looks to be more along the lines of a near-production prototype since it's unlikely to change all that much until 2025. Skoda calls it a design study rather than a concept.
Before the Epiq arrives in 2025, the bigger Elroq compact crossover will be officially unveiled later this year with an electric-only setup. These two will be joined by 2026 by the next-generation Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe. An Octavia-like wagon in EV flavor is also coming, along with a large three-row SUV previewed by the Vision 7S sans a combustion engine.

The Hyundai ST1 Is An Electric Work Van With Futuristic Styling,https://www.motor1.com/news/712338/hyundai-st1-work-van-reveal/,It looks like it traveled back from the future to do work.,2024-12-25 09:04:36,"And now for something completely different from Hyundai – a fully electric work van that looks like it has traveled back from the future. The ST1 sounds like the name of a trim level for a Ford Fiesta ST (RIP) or Focus ST sold in Europe. However, this alphanumeric designation denotes a purpose-built lineup of workhorses bundled as ""Service Type 1"" vehicles.
In typical Hyundai fashion, this initial reveal is only about the exterior design, with no details about technical specifications. We do know the ST1 is exclusively electric and has been developed to cater to small businesses in South Korea. It will be offered as a regular cargo van, a refrigerated van, and as a basic chassis cab for owners to retrofit the type of equipment they need.
Hyundai says it worked with local delivery companies to find out what they need from a work van. Riding on steelies and fitted with unpainted bumpers, the workhorse has a futuristic front-end design derived from the Staria minivan or the Kona small crossover. The main headlights are mounted unusually low while the full-width horizontal strip above is presumably for the daytime running lights.
The ST1 is tailored to those who need a more spacious van than what the Staria Load can offer and has chunky plastic cladding all around to protect the body. Much like on the Kona EV, the charging port is mounted at the front, to the right of what appears to be a small air intake. Hyundai likely had a good reason to put the front camera on the painted section of the bumper instead of moving it lower to blend it with the black plastic.
Hyundai says it developed the ST1 with the intent to make it easier to load and unload cargo by lowering the ride height. Although it looks like a box on wheels, the front upper spoiler was conceived with aerodynamic efficiency in mind. Even the bulky garnish connecting the cabin to the cargo area was designed to provide better airflow.
Full details and pricing will be disclosed in the first half of 2024 before the ST1 hits the domestic market later this year. Hyundai intends to sell the workhorse in other regions after the ST1 goes on sale in Korea.

"New Volkswagen ID.3 GTX And ID.7 GTX Tourer Come With More Power, Sporty Looks",https://insideevs.com/news/712084/vw-id3-gtx-id7-gtx-tourer-reveal-specs-details-photos/,"The ID.3 GTX gets VW’s most powerful electric motor, while the ID.7 GTX Tourer is the most powerful wagon ever made by VW.",2024-03-13 13:00:27,"Volkswagen is opening the performance EV floodgates with several sporty versions of its battery-powered models. So, without further ado, say hello to the new Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, ID.3 GTX Performance, and ID.7 GTX, the latter of which will be available in both Tourer (or wagon for American folks) and regular fastback sedan shapes.
A performance-oriented ID. Buzz GTX is also in the works, completing the GTX lineup of EVs that was started back in 2021 with the launch of the ID.4 GTX and ID.5 GTX.
Volkswagen goes all-in on the GTX lineup of EVs
Volkswagen revealed two new performance-oriented EVs today. The ID.3 GTX features the company's most powerful electric motor when specced in Performance guise, making up to 240 kW (321 hp), while the bigger ID.7 GTX Tourer becomes VW's most powerful wagon ever, with a total of 250 kW (335 hp) from a pair of electric motors.
We’ll start with the ID.7, since this one has the biggest chance of coming stateside, at least in fastback form, since the Tourer won’t be sold here. However, it’s exactly the Tourer version that gets the spotlight this time around because it is officially the most powerful wagon the German car manufacturer has ever made.
More Sporty EVs
Thanks to its dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup, the new Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Tourer makes a total of 250 kilowatts (335 horsepower), 40 kW (53 hp) more than the most powerful non-GTX ID.7 available. The rear APP550 permanent magnet synchronous motor on the rear axle makes 210 kW (281 hp), while the front AKA150 asynchronous motor puts out 80 kW (107 hp).
An 86-kilowatt-hour battery pack is the only power source available for the ID.7 GTX Tourer, the same that’s offered for the ID.7 Tourer Pro S. It can be recharged at up to 200 kW from a compatible DC fast charger, meaning that a 10 to 80% top-up can take less than 30 minutes in ideal conditions.
VW didn’t say how quickly the ID.7 GTX Tourer accelerates, but it did mention that the performance-oriented family EV “delivers maximum power and torque in a fraction of a second when accelerating.” But that’s valid for all modern EVs on the market, so take that as you may. The maximum speed is electronically limited to 180 kilometers per hour (111 miles per hour).
Compared to the rear-wheel drive-only ID.7 Tourer, the GTX comes with a different bumper with a honeycomb grille and a different light design that’s specific for GTX models. The outer roof frame strips are also painted black, as are the side mirrors, side sills, and the lower area of the rear bumper.
Inside, the maximum storage capacity of 1,714 liters (60.5 cubic feet) of the regular ID.7 Tourer is carried over to the GTX. However, VW has fitted GTX-specific seats to the sporty electric family hauler that come with red decorative seams and perforated red lettering in the backrests.
The ID.7 GTX also comes as standard with a specially tuned chassis, sportier steering, LED matrix headlights, LED tail light clusters with dynamic turn signals, tinted glass in the rear, 20-inch alloy wheels, and 30-color instead of 10-color background lighting. The sporty family EV also gets an enhanced augmented reality head-up display, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone automatic climate control, and the IDA voice assistant that integrates with ChatGPT.
The smallest of the ID family of EVs, the ID.3, also gets the GTX makeover almost five years after its debut in 2019. And to make up for lost time, VW fitted the most powerful version of its APP550 electric motor to date in the back of the compact electric hatchback.
In GTX Performance guise, the ID.3 makes a rather impressive 240 kW (321 hp) from just a single electric motor, whereas the previously mentioned ID.7 GTX Tourer has the same power output from two electric motors. At the same time, there’s an ID.3 GTX (non-Performance) that makes 210 kW (281 hp), the same as the single-motor ID.7. Torque is rated at 545 Newton-meters (401 pound-feet) for both output levels.
Volkswagen says the performance EV is more powerful than its most potent V6 turbocharged engines. The sporty ID.3 GTX needs 6 seconds to accelerate from zero to 62 mph (0-100 kph), while the more potent ID.3 GTX Performance cuts the time to 5.4 seconds. Top speed is limited to 180 kph (111 mph) and 200 kph (124 mph), respectively.
A bigger, 79-kWh (net) battery pack comes as standard for both versions of the ID.3 GTX. Besides being 2 kWh bigger than what’s available in the top-spec non-GTX ID.3, the new battery also increases the maximum DC charging speed from 170 kW to 175 kW. This means a 10 to 80% top-up can take about 26 minutes when connected to a compatible DC fast charger. The ID.3 GTX also features a battery pre-conditioning system that is enabled automatically when using the car’s built-in navigation system, or it can be enabled manually.
Volkswagen claims the expected combined WLTP driving range is roughly 600 km (372 miles). By comparison, the non-GTX ID.3 with the 77-kWh battery has a WLTP range of 5346 km (339 miles), while the entry-level model with the 58-kWh pack can travel for up to 426 km (264 miles), according to the WLTP testing.
Much like the bigger ID.7 GTX Tourer, the ID.3 GTX comes with a redesigned front bumper that integrates a pair of triangular LED daytime running lights, high-gloss black elements on the exterior, and 20-inch wheels. Inside, the compact EV features premium sport seats with red stitching as standard, as well as a new generation of the automaker’s infotainment system that includes ChatGPT integration and a 12.9-inch touchscreen.

"New Fiat 500e Versions Add Style, Luxury And Equipment",https://insideevs.com/news/711969/fiat-500e-drop-fall/,The Inspired By Beauty and Inspired by Music add more charm to the EV city car.,2024-03-11 17:00:08,"When Fiat announced its intention to bring the 500e to the U.S. and North America, it also introduced a novel method of selling its cars. Instead of a traditional inventory and order sheet, it would do “drops,” akin to a new designer bag, or a pair of red boots from MSCHF.
For each drop, a handful of units are made in a specific theme, color, or equipment package, and when they’re sold out—they’re sold out. Fiat has announced its latest drop, which follows up with its sold-out Project (Red) initial units. There are two new flavors of the Fiat 500e—Inspired by Beauty, and Inspired by Music, both of which add more style and equipment to the standard Fiat 500e.
Fiat's sales tactics could work
On paper, the Fiat 500e's price and range seem like a hard sell. But, Fiat's novel way of selling the model via ""drops"", could be the way forward for the brand. The initial drop, the Project (Red) edition, sold out fairly quickly after it was announced.
First up, is the inspired by Beauty. Painted in a trendy shade of Rose Gold, the Inspired By Beauty edition is the only way to get this paint color on a Fiat 500. Inside, Fiat has coated the dashboard and steering wheel in a fashionable eco-leather The seats are also wrapped in eco-leather, but colored beige.
The aptly named Inspired By Music variant is meant to appeal to Audiophiles. Developed with legendary Italian Maestro Andrea Bocelli, the Fiat 500e’s 7-speaker JBL audio system comes with a fleet of Virtual Venues that Fiat says “offers listeners a virtual-reality audio experience that changes the acoustic characteristics of the car depending on the chosen location.” There are four to choose from that Fiat describes as follows:
• My Music Room – An intimate musical experience as if the artist was playing your favorite song right in front of you
• My Recording Studio – Pure acoustics and beautiful tones of a real recording space created specifically for music and recording
• Giuseppe Verdi Opera House, Pisa – Feel the spectacular nature of music in a unique theatre setting.  It’s as if you were sitting front and center, enjoying a live performance
• Open-Air Arena – Hear the unmistakable acoustics and energetic feeling of an open-air arena
Underneath, both editions are the same as the standard Fiat 500e. This means the car has a 149-mile range from a 42 kWh battery. That might not sound like much, but it does seem fairly respectable for a car with a not-so-big battery. That battery feeds a 117-horsepower front motor, pulling the car to 60 MPH in 8.5 seconds. Also, the two new variants introduce Fiat’s new level 2 ADAS system. The details are thin, but Fiat says the 500e uses the lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control for Level 2 hands-on monitored assisted driving in some places.
The Inspired By Beauty and Inspired By Music editions are a little pricier than the standard 500e. These units are $37,595, including the destination fee, up from the $34,095 of the initial Project (Red) edition. The Inspired By Music, and Inspired By Beauty editions will go on sale this coming fall.

"The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT With 1,092 HP Is Porsche’s New Performance King",https://insideevs.com/news/711859/2025-porsche-taycan-turbo-gt/,It’s also the fastest series production electric car around Laguna Seca and the Nürburgring.,2024-03-11 09:35:09,"Porsche has long prided itself on making lightweight, engaging, precise, and fast cars, prioritizing driving experience over raw performance figures. In the electric vehicle era, this ethos is evolving due to the superior efficiency of electric motors compared to combustion engines. That means Porsche's signature persona now inevitably intersects with four-digit performance figures.
And that's exactly what you're getting today, with the new top-of-the-line Porsche Taycan Turbo GT and the Turbo GT with the Weissach package. This is incontrovertibly Porsche’s new performance king, beating even the decorated 992 911 GT2 RS and the long-gone hybrid 918 Spyder.
The race to make the fastest electric sedan.
Electric motors can extract energy from a battery pack far more efficiently than combustion engines can from fuel. That unlocks absurd levels of horsepower and torque. In the Porsche stable, the Taycan Turbo GT is the new performance king, and it's now in the same league as the Lucid Air Sapphire and the Tesla Model S Plaid.
InsideEVs tested one of its sensible siblings in California last month, the 2025 Taycan 4S. We came away impressed with its range and charging performance, despite testing in inclement weather. In fact, the MY2025 Taycans are among the fastest-charging EVs in the U.S. right now.
In our charging test last month at a 350-kilowatt Electrify America DC fast charger, the Taycan 4S displayed a peak charging rate of 295 kW. It went from 8% to 80% in just 18 minutes. Its real-world range is now comfortably over 300 miles, although we await official EPA ratings. The absurd Taycan Turbo GT, on the other hand, is more about performance than anything else.
To set itself apart from the other variants, it features a front spoiler with aero blades. Giving it a beefy track-focused stance are 21-inch lightweight forged wheels and SportDesign side skirts with carbon fiber inlays. The wing mirrors and B-pillars are also finished in carbon fiber. For additional downforce around corners, there’s a new adaptive spoiler, with a Gurney flap that enables a total downforce of 485 pounds. (The non-Weissach package car gets a ducktail spoiler.)
Inside, it gets 18-way adjustable sports seats and various exclusive elements like unique Turbo GT embroidering and contrasting Volt Blue or GT Silver interior colors.
But more importantly, Porsche seemed determined to shred as many calories as possible from the Taycan. With the Weissach package, gone are the rear seats. (Four seats are available without the package.) Instead, you get a storage compartment behind the driver and front passenger seats with carbon fiber cladding. This, Porsche says, saves 157 pounds of weight compared to the Taycan Turbo which weighs just a shade above 5,000 pounds.
The Taycan Turbo GT features some big upgrades in the powertrain department. New 900-amp pulse inverters—key devices in electric motors that regulate the flow of current into the motor windings—with silicon carbide semiconductors significantly reduce “switching losses” and allow higher “switching frequencies.”
For context, the Taycan Turbo S uses 600-amp pulse inverters. But technical jargon aside, all this means bucketloads of performance.
Base power is up only slightly, from 764 hp in the Turbo S to 777 hp in the Turbo GT. With launch control, the Turbo S maxes out at 938 hp and 818 pound-foot of torque, whereas the newly unveiled Turbo GT takes that to the next level, with 1,019 hp and 988 lb-ft for two seconds, or 1,092 hp as per Porsche’s peak power measurement method.
There’s also an “attack mode,” which unlocks 160 hp at the press of a button for 10 seconds.
Zero to 60 miles per hour sprint takes just 2.2 seconds. With the Weissach package, it’s 2.1 seconds. The Turbo S does the job in 2.3 seconds. Although these acceleration figures seem right up there with the Lucid Air Sapphire and the Model S Track Package. However, the Lucid is more powerful on paper, with 1,234 hp, whereas the Model S Plaid makes about 1,020 hp.
But it's worth noting that the Taycan Turbo GT can squeeze nearly 1,100 horsepower just from two electric motors, one on each axle, whereas the competition is equipped with three.
Porsche isn't chasing the best performance numbers here. With the Weissach package, the Taycan Turbo GT’s maximum straight-line speed is 190 mph, whereas the Model S Track Package tops out at 200 mph, and the Air Sapphire maxes out at 205 mph. However, on a racetrack, the Turbo GT will likely obliterate any other four-door electric sedan with its aerodynamic wizardry.
In fact, it has already done that. A black, low-slung pre-production Taycan with a fixed rear wing, a performance body kit, and German number plates was seen hugging the corners of the Nurburgring at blistering speeds early this year. It was some 17.6 seconds quicker than the Tesla Model S Track Package around the legendary racetrack.
On February 23, 2024, a Turbo GT in the Volt Blue livery set a time of 1:27:87 around Laguna Seca, narrowly beating the 1:28:20 time set by a heavily modified Model S Plaid in 2021.
The 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT is now available to order in the U.S. at a starting price of $230,000, excluding fees and destination charges. Deliveries begin in the summer of 2024. The Turbo S costs roughly $20,000 less. With options, the Turbo GT could easily surpass the Lucid Air Sapphire’s $249,000 MSRP. In this company, the $20,000 Track Package for the Model S seems like a bargain.
Porsche has said that the 911 will continue having a combustion engine for ""as long as possible."" So an electric Taycan at the top of Porsche's performance charts could now be the new normal.

Read all about it in our debut post packed with information and photos of this very potent EV.
The New Porsche Taycan Turbo GT: This Is It
The ""most dynamic Taycan of all time"" will go official later today as a more powerful version of Porsche's hot EV. Likely to gain the ""Turbo GT"" suffix, the high-performance electric sedan will have the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire in its crosshairs. It already has a feather in its cap by setting a Nürburgring lap record for purely electric models.
Porsche has been tight-lipped about the Taycan Turbo GT but the spy shots of virtually undisguised prototypes running around the 'Ring revealed a more aggressive body. The comprehensive aero package will include that look-at-me rear wing and more subtle tweaks for better airflow. The engineers from Zuffenhausen might have put the Taycan on a diet before sending it to the gym to build some muscle. It's a logical assumption since the Cayenne Turbo GT also got more power and lost weight.
We'll have to wait and see whether those rumors about a third motor will pan out, but even without it, combined output is likely to hit four digits, at least with a boost function. Look for neck-snapping acceleration since adding power while removing weight will likely enable a 0 to 60 mph run in the low two-second range. Odds are we're going to see the most powerful production Porsche ever, although a temporary title since the Mission X supercar has high chances of entering production.
Let's face it – the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT won't save our fragile planet with its electric drivetrain. The intent here is to show an EV can be more than just absurdly quick in a straight line. It can be fun to drive around a track despite what will certainly still be a lofty curb weight. Driving it at full tilt is going to drain the battery at a much higher rate but that's a sacrifice owners will be willing to make.
As to how much it’s going to cost, a 2025 Taycan Turbo S is already an eye-watering $210,995. Porsche is likely to charge at least an extra $20,000 for the new crown jewel of the lineup. With options, you'll likely end up spending a quarter of a million dollars.

The Chevy Blazer EV Is On Sale Again—With A Big Price Cut,https://insideevs.com/news/711746/chevy-blazer-ev-sales-resume/,GM halted new sales of the SUV late last year due to software issues.,2024-03-08 13:12:43,"General Motors is finally putting the Chevrolet Blazer EV debacle behind it. The automaker has resumed sales of the troubled SUV after pulling it off the market due to software issues in December.
Plus, GM on Friday announced new, cheaper pricing for the Blazer EV lineup that could help juice sales following the pause. The entry-level Blazer EV LT AWD got the biggest price cut, bringing its MSRP (including destination) to $50,195 from $56,715.
GM's Chevy Blazer snafu
General Motors paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV in December due to serious software problems. InsideEVs experienced this firsthand when a BlazerEV we were testing broke down at a charging station, leaving our reviewer stranded.
Add on the $7,500 federal tax credit, which GM said that the Blazer EV now qualifies for, and the base price for a Blazer EV comes down to $42,695. Rules around which vehicles could receive the tax credit changed at the beginning of 2024.
Pricing for currently available Blazer EV trims is as follows, including destination charges:
Before the stop-sale order, InsideEVs' very own Kevin Williams had a Blazer EV press vehicle break down during a road trip, leaving him stranded at a charging station. GM didn't specify what kinds of software improvements allowed it to restart sales. The company delivered fewer than 500 Blazer EVs before the pause.
The Blazer EV isn't just another GM product. It's more important than that. The electric SUV launched late last year as the automaker's first next-generation EV truly aimed at the mass market. Other GM EVs riding on the company's new Ultium battery platform were the niche GMC Hummer EV, the pricy Cadillac Lyriq and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, a pickup truck.
Only the Blazer EV, a midsized SUV, aimed straight at the heart of the American car-buying public and at America's best-selling electric model, the Tesla Model Y. GM had already been slow to accelerate Ultium-based vehicle sales due to issues ramping up battery production. And it has ambitious plans to make billions per year on a wide variety of software, much of which it is developing in-house.
So it was a blow when software problems pushed GM to stop sales. To be sure, GM isn't alone here. EV startups and traditional automakers alike have been struggling with vehicle software, which is becoming more important as manufacturers eye snazzy tech features and subscription services.
A lot continues to ride on the success of the Ultium vehicles and the software that runs on them. So, for GM's sake, hopefully it's ironed out the serious kinks.

The New Rivian R2 Gets A Kitchen And A Rooftop Tent,https://www.motor1.com/news/711633/rivian-r2-accessories-features/,Other nifty features include a dual glovebox and a flashlight.,2024-12-25 09:04:40,"Rivian delivered an unexpected one-two punch yesterday at the unveiling of the R2 where it took everyone by surprise with the even smaller R3. However, the first order of business is to kick off deliveries of its long-awaited Tesla Model Y rival, but that won't happen until the first half of 2026. When it does eventually hit the streets, the R2 will be compatible with a series of nifty accessories.
Much like the bigger R1T pickup and R1S SUV, the latest entry in Rivian's growing lineup caters to outdoorsy people with a bunch of optional goodies. For example, the Travel Kitchen bundles a water tank, a cooler, an induction cooktop with additional storage and even a cookware set. Rivian will throw in some hanging lights for when you're cooking at night in the middle of nowhere.
Alternatively, the small kitchen can make way for a detachable cargo box with handles on the sides and tiny wheels to carry it around. It's good for items that would otherwise make a mess inside the car, kind of like a tiny portable pickup truck bed. The interior is also great at storing stuff since not only you can fold flat the rear bench but also both front seats. Oh, and there's a front trunk as well.
What else? The cargo box on the roof is nothing to write home about but Rivian can swap it for a so-called Treehouse. It's a boxy rooftop tent that comes bundles with a ladder for ease of access. Installed at the rear, the bike mount is hooked up to the R2 without having to use tools and it can store two bikes. While some cars have built-in umbrella holders in the driver's door, the electric SUV uses that space for a flashlight.
Although undoubtedly an interesting EV, the new Rivian R2 will sadly take its sweet time to hit the market. It’s especially true in Europe (including the UK) where it won't go on sale until 2027. In the United States, prices will start at around $45,000 but you'll be paying more for these accessories. Logic tells us the Euro version will be more expensive given the value-added tax (VAT).

"Rivian R2 Won't Get Air Suspension, Will Be Dynamically 'Better' Than R1",https://insideevs.com/news/711606/rivian-r2-ditches-air-suspension/,Rivian might make some compromises but is advertising the R2 as a proper adventure EV.,2024-03-07 17:07:21,"Rivian is having a moment today. Following the reveal of its more affordable R2 electric SUV, and the retro-modern R3 and R3X compact crossovers, the start-up’s shares soared 13%. InsideEVs’ Deputy Editor Mack Hogan was at the event in California this afternoon, and we have some additional information about the R2 and R3 from one of the company’s top executives.
For starters, the R2 will not get air suspension, according to Jeff Hammoud, the chief design officer at Rivian. Both the R1S and R1T get independent air suspension, allowing 6.5 inches of vertical travel. The lowest setting can be as low as 7.9 inches, and the ride height can increase to a maximum of 14.4 inches.

The California-based EV startup unveiled two new adventure-themed vehicles today, both more affordable than its current offerings. They won't go on sale until 2026 at the earliest, but when and if they do, they'll help Rivian reach the mass volume it needs to be a stable and long-term automaker.
Air suspension typically allows for improved handling, comfort, aerodynamics, and stability. It also enables self-leveling ride height, which balances for better handling when towing or carrying heavy loads.
Despite the omission, the R2 is expected to be “dynamically better” than the R1 models, Hammoud said.
Dynamically better could mean several things—the R2 might have better handling and agility, or simply be a better on-road vehicle. In traditional terms, ""dynamic"" cars can absorb bumps and road imperfections effectively and keep the vehicle stable and responsive to the driver’s inputs. The R2’s smaller size and presumably lighter weight should also make it more “dynamic.”
To be clear, we won’t know any of this for sure until the R2 comes out in 2026.
That said, the R2 and R3 seem built for outdoorsy owners. Both the EVs have separate ports above the trailer hitch for quickly mounting bike racks, storage boxes, and other items. The locking port sends power to the mounted accessory to run brake lights. You can store it in the frunk and take it on or off sans any tools.
The R2 also borrows some features from its bigger sibling. There’s a fold-out tray in the trunk to sit on. There will also be a camp kitchen available, but its design will be different from the original unit we saw on the R1T, according to Hammoud. He indicated that it will work with all Rivians, as well as other vehicles, so it will likely be a standalone external accessory and probably not something that sits flush behind the rear seats.

Rivian R3X: Say Hello To The Off-Road Focused R3,https://insideevs.com/news/711584/rivian-r3x-performance-offroad-focused-electric-crossover/,Rivian’s third big unveil of the day is the beefed-up R3X electric crossover designed to drive off the beaten path.,2024-03-07 13:47:26,"Rivian made a big splash in California today by revealing its next-generation R2 electric SUV. Just minutes after CEO RJ Scaringe showcased the R2, he surprised everyone with the R3 compact crossover, followed by another new model: its performance-focused, rally-styled sibling, the R3X.
""Looking at the R3, we wanted to take everything that's embodied and put it into a higher performance package, and this is something we call the R3X,"" Scaringe said at the unveiling event. Call it a modern take on the Russian Lada Niva 1600 from the 1980s, or the VW Golf Country, or heck, even the Crosstrek STI that Subaru never built.
At first glance, the R3X appears like a riotous R3 with a higher ground clearance and wider stance. It has multiple visual elements distinguishing it from the R3. The model showcased had orange mirrors, two tow hooks in the front bumper—which itself looks more muscular—and it also has blacked-out side skirts.
""It will deliver a level of on and off-road performance that will get us all very excited,"" Scaringe said.
Speaking of off-road, the R3X's tires and wheels are the most striking elements. It appeared equipped with all-terrain tires and full-wheel covers. Rivian even released a video on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, of the R3X going sideways in the desert, which says a lot about what Rivian wants the R3X to be—a proper high-octane off-roader.
Scaringe confirmed a tri-motor set-up—although it could be a while before Rivian releases its actual horsepower, range, and battery details.
The cabin follows a similar design theme. Rivian internally calls the cabin layout ""rugged playful."" It seems to have anodized metal panels and several sustainable materials. There's a tan and black seat upholstery with Rivian's signature oval inserts all around. Like its R1 and R2 siblings, the rear seats fold flat.
Cabin layout-wise, nothing surprising here. There's the same hyper-minimalist approach with few physical buttons and maximum digital real estate in the form of a massive central touchscreen and a digital gauge cluster. You also get coat hooks behind the front seat backrests as well as unique straps to hold items like towels.
If Rivian keeps up with its promise, the R3 and the R3X could end up becoming even bigger vehicles than the R2 in terms of sales volumes. The smaller and presumably more affordable R3 is what the market needs to encourage wider EV adoption, and ultimately contribute more towards emissions reduction.
However, it's one thing to stoke enthusiasm among your fan base, and another to deliver as promised. The company is still burning millions of dollars in cash and has a long way to go before witnessing any profitability. But we cannot rule out the possibility that these new and exciting models can help it get there.
Rivian said R3X deliveries will begin after the R2, which is expected to arrive in the first half of 2026. Although Scaringe implied that the R3 and R3X will be manufactured at its upcoming $5 billion factory in Georgia, it seems like the small crossovers could be initially made in Normal, Illinois, and production could later shift to Georgia.

Rivian R3: Meet Rivian's Surprise Compact Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/711576/rivian-r3-reveal-2024/,Rivian had something extra at the R2 reveal today. Here's what we know about its new compact entry-level vehicle.,2024-03-07 13:27:31,"It turns out the folks at Rivian had more in store for EV fans everywhere than just the Rivian R2 that debuted in California today. Meet the Rivian R3, an even smaller, more affordable compact crossover that's going to take the electric vehicle startup brand to new heights in the coming years.
""It takes the package of R2, and the platform, and shrinks it,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said during the car's unveiling today. ""It puts it into our take on a crossover. And as a vehicle, it's almost hard to define what it is, but it so beautifully captures our brand and what we represent as a company.""
Until now, Rivian's offerings—the R1S SUV and R1T truck—have operated in a larger, much more expensive space. The R2 is expected to bring a whole new audience to the brand with a far lower price and the long-term goal of volume sales, mass production and stability for a startup automaker that's doing better than others but has many of the usual challenges.
But what nobody expected was for Rivian today to go even more compact and cheaper. Almost Lada-like in form (and presumably off-road function), the small EV brings Rivian into a space it's never played in before.
Scaringe said the car is about five inches shorter than the R2, with a smaller wheelbase, ""but leveraging all of the same content—the single motor, the dual motor and the tri-motor.""
Rivian officials said both the R2 and R3 will feature two battery sizes, with the larger one targeting ""over 300 miles of range"" and the quickest cars being able to do zero to 60 mph in just three seconds. With pricing on the R2 expected to be around $45,000, the R3 is to slot in below that, although no details were offered.
Like the R2, the R3 will use Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug from the factory, making it natively compatible with Tesla's vast charging network. Both vehicles will be able to use Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs with an adapter. All are said to go from a 10% charge to 80% in less than 30 minutes. Additionally, the R3 ""will provide dramatically enhanced autonomous capabilities"" thanks to Rivian's five-radar, 11-camera automated driving assistance setup.
Scaringe added that the R3 won't skimp on the adventure vibes that made the bigger SUVs and trucks more famous. The second row of seats fold flat for camping adventures and the rear glass can be adjusted to carry large objects, like surfboards or instruments.
The CEO also then showed off a performance-focused variant called the Rivian R3X, which looks less built for camping and more ready for the rally stage. The R2, R3 and R3X will be available internationally following their North American launch, company officials said.  Scaringe also implied that the R3 and R3X will be built at the company's forthcoming Georgia factory.
The CEO said that the company has been ""working hard... to get them to as many people as possible as quickly as possible,"" and that Rivian hopes to begin R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026. ""We're able to do that we're able to achieve that that accelerated time by leveraging our production capabilities in Normal, using using our Illinois site to launch R2 and get that into market as quickly as we can.""
As for the R3 and R3X, those cars have no official release date yet. In the meantime, Rivian as a startup still has a tremendous amount to prove. But today, it succeeded in giving its fans something to hope for.

Rivian R2: This Is It,https://insideevs.com/news/711446/rivian-r2-suv-revealed/,"After months of teasers, Rivian's upcoming smaller SUV broke cover on Thursday.",2024-03-07 13:17:48,"After months of teasers and blurry spy shots, Rivian's next vehicle has finally been revealed. Meet the R2 crossover, the EV startup's long-awaited follow-up to its acclaimed R1T pickup truck and R1S three-row SUV.
The R2, Rivian announced on Thursday, will go into production in the first half of 2026. It's available to reserve with a $100 refundable deposit on Rivian's website and will start at $45,000.
This is Rivian's Tesla Model 3 moment
By establishing a brand-new U.S. car company and selling tens of thousands of high-end trucks and SUVs to paying customers, Rivian has accomplished the (nearly) impossible. Now it needs to turn a profit. The cheaper, higher-volume R2 SUV could propel Rivian to the promised land, much like the Model 3 sedan did for Tesla.
Much to everyone's surprise, at the R2 event in California Rivian also revealed the R3, an even smaller crossover built on the R2's platform. The whiplash didn't end there, as Rivian CEO and founder R.J. Scaringe went on to unveil the R3X, a higher-performance tri-motor variant of the R3.
It's tough to overstate how big a moment this is for Rivian. Getting a couple of high-end models into production and into customer hands is a massive feat in itself. Now comes the even harder part: Making enough money consistently to become a viable business. That's where the R2 and R3 come in.
As early leaks suggested, the production R2 looks a lot like a baby R1S. It has similarly boxy-yet-cute styling but in a more compact package. It's 185.6 inches long, compared to the R1S's 200.8 inches. That makes the R2 roughly the size of a Tesla Model Y, or slightly larger than a Toyota RAV4. The three-row R1S is closer in size to a Chevy Tahoe.
The R2 with a larger battery option will have at least 300 miles of range, Rivian said. It will come equipped with the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, charging port, which Tesla pioneered and most of the U.S. auto industry is switching to.
The R2 will come in single-, dual-, and tri-motor variants. The highest-performance SUV will have a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 3 seconds, Scaringe said. It will be built at Rivian's plant in Normal, Illinois to start. Importantly, the company says that will allow it to start pumping out R2s before its new factory in Georgia is up and running.
The upcoming SUV offers up some quirky features, like Rivian's signature flashlight that pops out from the driver's door. It also has two glove boxes and a retracting rear window. Both rows of seating fold down to make extra room for camping.
Details are more scant for the R3 and R3X. So far, we don't know how much they'll cost or when they'll arrive. Scaringe said they'll also have two glove boxes and a neat rear window that acts as a secondary hatch.
Smaller and cheaper than the Rivians that came before it, the R2 should let the upstart tap into a much wider customer base than it currently has. That's critical for a company that lost $5.4 billion in 2023. Moreover, Rivian said it doesn't plan to produce more vehicles in 2024 than it did last year, disappointing investors and indicating that demand for the R1T and R1S isn't growing.
Rivian's won acclaim for its rugged EVs and sold many more vehicles than fellow startups Lucid Motors and Fisker. It's diversified its business by making commercial electric vans—first for Amazon (a large Rivian investor) and now for all paying customers. But none of that will matter if it can't ride the R2 platform to long-term financial health.

Watch The Rivian R2 Livestream Debut Here,https://insideevs.com/news/711535/rivian-r2-debut/,The debut event starts at 1 PM Eastern / 10 AM Pacific.,2024-03-07 09:49:25,"The hotly anticipated Rivian R2 will debut today around 1 PM Eastern time and we'll be live on the scene for the reveal event.
However, Rivian will also livestream the debut and you can watch it right here.
Rivian R2 debuts today.
Rivian's affordable electric SUV debuts today and it could be the make-it-or-break-it vehicle for the electric startup.
The R2 will reportedly be priced from $47,000 and will get the full $7,500 tax credit, according to Rivian's CEO RJ Scaringe. This means that the effective price will be just below $40,000.
More On The Rivian R2
The Rivian R2 will reportedly offer seating for 5, an estimated range of 330 miles on a full charge, and come equipped with a NACS plug from the factory. The most capable version of the R2 should be able to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds.
As for its size, we previously reported the following:
Rivian’s smallest electric SUV to date is on par with the Model Y. Measuring 185.6 inches long, 75 in wide (excluding mirrors), and 9.8 in tall, the R2 is 1.4 in shorter, 0.6 in narrower, and 2.9 in taller than the Model Y. The wheelbase is 115.6 in.
The R2 will still be somewhat capable in the off-road category. Maximum ground clearance is 9.8 in with 32-inch wheels. The approach angle is 25 degrees and the departure angle is 27 degrees. These numbers are not nearly as impressive as the R1T or R1S though.
The Rivian R2 will be built at the company’s new factory in Georgia and will go on sale in 2026. The first sales will be in the U.S., with Canada to follow. Later on, the R2 will be offered in Europe too.
More details are expected to be released today and order books should open as soon as the R2 is revealed.
The livestream starts at 1 PM Eastern / 10 AM Pacific.

Dodge Says It Doesn't Care About The Charger Daytona's Efficiency Or Range,https://www.motor1.com/news/711242/dodge-charger-daytona-efficency-range/,"Dodge boss Tim Kuniskis says muscle-car owners don't care about efficiency. That said, the Charger Daytona is surprisingly efficient.",2024-12-25 09:04:44,"The Dodge Charger goes electric with the new Daytona model, but it is still unashamedly a muscle car. At a preview event for the Charger Daytona, Dodge head Tim Kuniskis told gathered media ""I don’t care. This is about performance,"" when asked about range and efficiency.
""Muscle car owners don’t care about fuel economy,"" he added. That said, the EPA range figures for the Charger Daytona are solid. The Charger Daytona R/T promises a 317-mile range from its 100.5-kWh gross (93.4-kWh net) battery pack, while the more powerful Scat Pack should do 260 miles on a full charge. Your milage may obviously vary – especially if you take advantage of the Daytona's donut mode – but that's an average figure of 3.4 miles/kWh for the R/T and 2.78 mi/kWh for the Scat Pack. Not bad for vehicles that weigh 5,838 pounds and offer 496 and 670 horsepower, respectively.
Charging rate is impressive too. The Charger Daytona uses a 400-volt electrical architecture, which usually translates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW, but it seems like it uses the trick of virtually splitting the battery pack into two virtual units charging in parallel, boosting speeds. The maximum rate of 183 kW is achievable at 350-kW stations.
So maybe Dodge didn't care about range or efficiency, but accidentally made an efficient car with a respectable range. All the more impressive given the power, size, and huge weight of the thing.
But we have to agree with Kuniskis here. We doubt muscle-car buyers will care.

2024 Dodge Charger Daytona Coupe And Sedan: Meet The First EV Muscle Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/711112/dodge-charger-daytona-ev-revealed/,Dodge's first electric cars go hard out of the gate with up to 670 horsepower and a thunderous simulated exhaust.,2024-03-05 11:00:18,"After months of concepts and teases, the Mopar world finally knows what the first electric muscle cars from Dodge will be. Meet the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona, which comes as a coupe and, much to our surprise, a sedan too. It’s a striking move for a brand whose product strategy in recent years has largely amounted to: “What if we put a bigger V8 in it?”
And yet, times are changing. U.S. consumers are asking for more electric options. Tesla is the most valuable carmaker on the planet and is stealing market share from old-guard manufacturers. Regulations aimed at curbing climate-warming emissions are pushing the internal combustion engine toward extinction. And more importantly for Dodge's target audience, the zero-to-60 mph times for electric cars are putting gas engines to shame.
A new, electric era for Dodge
Dodge first teased the concept for its first electric car back in 2022. Now it's broken cover looking pretty darn similar to that initial design.
Dodge can either cling to its V8s for dear life—or pivot. And it made the smarter move here. Being able to do 60 mph in as low as 3.3 seconds, making it slightly quicker than the old Hellcat Redeye cars, just sweetens the deal.
So, behold the 2024 Charger Daytona. The world’s first electric muscle car goes on sale in mid-2024, representing a big leap forward for Dodge and its European parent company, Stellantis, which is expanding its electric offerings globally but has been slow to do so in the U.S.
The Charger also reflects an important broadening of the limited U.S. EV market. More different types of vehicles that appeal to more buyers should help drive people toward EVs who didn’t have an option before. And while we knew the coupe was coming, the Charger sedan—which looks delightfully similar to the old gas-powered one—is a welcome addition to the small but growing electric four-door market.
The Charger Daytona arrives as a coupe that replaces the outgoing (gas-powered) Dodge Challenger. It also marks the start of a whole new Charger family.
Next year, Dodge plans to start production of four-door electric models to replace the current Charger, along with both two- and four-door gas-powered versions. They'll all share the same underlying platform, known as STLA Large.
It comes in two trims to start. The R/T debuts with 496 horsepower and 404 pound-feet of torque. The Scat Pack arrives with 670 horses, 627 pound-feet of torque and a claimed zero-to-60 time of just 3.3 seconds.
For now, Dodge has only shared details about the coupe, so that’s what we’re focusing on. (This is confusing, but only the Charger EVs are Daytonas.)
Dodge will be the first to tell you that the Charger Daytona isn’t trying to be the greenest car on the market. It doesn’t offer world-beating range or amazing efficiency. What it does provide is the beefcake performance Dodge is known for, along with solid marks across the board as far as EV stuff is concerned.
Both the R/T and Scat Pack are propelled by dual electric motors that grant it full-time all-wheel drive. They’re equipped with a rather large 100.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack that returns a respectable 317 miles of range in the R/T and a less ideal 260 in the Scat Pack.
Clearly, these cars weren’t designed for optimum efficiency; a Tesla Model 3 earns an EPA-estimated 341 miles of range with a battery pack that’s roughly 20% smaller.
That’s something Dodge owns openly. Its buyers have largely never worried about energy consumption, so why would they start to care now?
“When was the last time anyone calculated the fuel economy of their muscle car? Yeah, they never did,” Dodge brand CEO Tim Kuniskis said in a promotional video launched on Tuesday.
That may be true. But battery size will dictate how much the Charger Daytona ultimately costs. Dodge hasn’t quoted a price yet, but we know that batteries are the single most expensive part of an EV. We also know that Stellantis proudly says that, unlike rivals, it turns a profit on its electric vehicles. The entry price here will be very interesting, especially considering what a performance bargain the old cars were.
With a peak charge rate of 183 kilowatts, the Daytona can recharge from 20%-80% in just under 28 minutes, Dodge says, which is getting to be on the slower side these days. The big battery pack doesn’t help there either, but the charge rate is at least higher than some rivals.
Dodge went to great lengths to make its first EV as traditionally Dodge-y as possible. That starts with tire-shredding performance but includes a whole lot more.
The sleek Charger Daytona looks just like the awesome concept car that Dodge unveiled a few years back. It retains the muscular, retro-inspired features Dodge is known for and avoids the “melted jelly bean” look of so many EVs these days, Kuniskis told journalists during a briefing. Dodge accomplished that in a rather clever way.
At first glance, the front end looks totally squared off, but that’s actually an illusion. A slim opening up front allows air to pass more smoothly over the Daytona’s hood and windscreen, boosting its aerodynamic qualities. A flat nose that just bullies air out of the way wouldn’t be great for range.
Then there’s the (hilariously named) “Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust.” It isn’t just a speaker that plays engine noises for all to hear, but rather an actual exhaust-like contraption that rumbles much like a V8-powered Dodge would. It can also be switched off completely for when owners want to roll around in silence, as the EV gods intended.
A PowerShot button on the steering wheel activates 40 extra horsepower for a brief stint. Plus, there’s a Donut Mode that helps you do donuts. Clearly, Dodge wants buyers to know that just because a car has electric motors instead of an engine, that doesn't mean it can't be loud, fast and in your face.
European auto giant Stellantis has felt like a bit of a laggard in the EV space, at least in the U.S. Its first EV for American consumers is arriving imminently in the form of the tiny Fiat 500e. The Charger Daytona represents an important next step toward Stellantis becoming a real presence in the U.S. electric market. Stellantis is also planning EVs from its Jeep, Ram Chrysler brands.
Of course, we’ll have to wait and see how well the Charger and other Stellantis EVs perform—both on the road and in the marketplace. But anybody who counted Stellantis out may have spoken too soon.

The New Karma Gyesera EV Already Looks Familiar,https://www.motor1.com/news/710942/karma-gyesera-debut-specs/,Karma's first electric sedan promises 250 miles of range.,2024-12-25 09:04:46,"This year marks Karma Automotive's 10th anniversary. With that the company debuted the Gyesera—an evolution of the GSe-6, a fully electric sedan revealed in 2021. The GSe-6 had a design reminiscent of the plug-in hybrid Revero launched in 2016, which superseded the short-lived Fisker Karma introduced in 2011.
But the Gyesera hopes to be more than just a remix. Karma President Marques McCammon told Automotive News that almost all body panels are new compared to the Revero. Only a section of the rear quarter panels has been carried over. Even still, the styling looks familiar. The body is made from a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber on a spaceframe chassis made from aluminum.
Changes have been made to about 85 percent of the car, added McCammon. Karma Vice President, Global Design Michelle Christensen goes as far as to say it's ""the most badass GT on the road."" The new Gyesera is 199.9 inches long, 78.9 inches wide, and 52.4 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 124.4 inches. To put those numbers into perspective, it's 3.9 inches longer and 1.6 inches wider than a Tesla Model S but rides 4.5 inches lower to the ground.
The rear-wheel-drive Karma Gyesera aims to deliver 590 horsepower and 693 pound-feet of torque to enable a 0-60 mph run in less than 4.2 seconds and a top speed of over 135 mph. The specs sheet reveals a curb weight of 5,300 pounds. Mind you, these are preliminary figures based on simulations and early testing, so the numbers could change until production starts. There's a 120.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack with enough juice for over 250 miles, but the range is also a projection.
Karma Automotive intends to start production before the end of this year but doesn't rule out an early 2025 market launch. The electric sedan will be a limited-run affair since only approximately 2,000 units will be made during a production run of four or five years.
It's going to cost between $175,000 and $225,000, according to Automotive News. That's going to make it a lot more expensive than a Tesla Model S (from $74,990), a Porsche Taycan (from $99,400), a Mercedes EQS (from $104,400), or an Audi E-Tron GT (from $106,500).
Introduced this weekend at the Amelia Island Concours, the Gyesera can already be preordered for $5,000. The new sedan follows last year's introduction of the Kaveya electric coupe slated to go on sale in the final quarter of 2025 as the brand's flagship car. Meanwhile, an updated plug-in hybrid Revero is expected to hit the assembly line in Q3 2024.

"The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Gets A Bigger Battery, More Buttons, Rear Wiper",https://insideevs.com/news/710930/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-updates/,Everyone's favorite Giugiaro-cyberpunk electric SUV gets some upgrades we're very excited about.,2024-03-03 21:07:34,"At this point, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't at least respect the Hyundai Ioniq 5. With an eye-catching 1980s retrofuture design that looks like almost nothing else on the road and class-leading specs, this electric crossover is a favorite for many reasons. Now it's about to get even better for the 2025 model year with some upgraded specs we're rather excited about—including more buttons.
On Sunday, Hyundai unveiled the updated Ioniq 5 in South Korea, and while the car barely looks different on the outside—it has a slightly updated grille and front and rear bumpers—there are some serious improvements in play here. (You can also spot a new one from the rear spoiler that's been extended by 50 mm and the new wheels.)
And there's finally one big change here that's been requested by many: a rear windshield wiper. Take that, rain and snow.
The Ioniq 5 Has Been A Game-Changer
Hyundai's Ioniq 5 has racked up awards, hit sales records and made the world notice how advanced Korea's EV game is. As the electric competition heats up, it doesn't seem to be taking a breather.
I'll start by noting that this is the global debut of the updated Ioniq 5, and it's not clear yet what changes are coming to the U.S. market; the car Hyundai showed off continues to have digital side mirrors, and American buyers have never been able to get those, for example. But we do expect some, if not all, of these changes will come stateside eventually.
We'll start with the big news: the Ioniq 5 gets a bigger battery. Previously, buyers could choose from a standard 58.0-kWh battery pack or a larger 77.4-kWh pack. Now Hyundai is offering an 84.0-kWh pack, implying in a news release that this pack replaces the 77.4-kWh unit. Either way, that means the top Ioniq 5 will come with more range.
Not that the Ioniq 5 needed a ton of help in that department, of course. The current 2024 model in the U.S. gets 220 miles of range on the standard battery and 260 miles or 303 miles on the larger one, depending on whether you spring for all- or rear-wheel-drive, respectively. In other words, if this larger battery comes stateside, we could expect something like 330 miles in RWD form—but we'll wait for the official EPA estimates first.
More changes extend inside the cabin as well. There's a new steering wheel with ""interactive pixel lights,"" and a whole new row of buttons on the center console near the cupholders that didn't exist before. The ""Map"" and ""Navigation"" buttons have been combined into one, remedying a Hyundai-Kia quirk that has annoyed me for years, and the row of digital switches near the infotainment system appears to have received some tweaks as well.
There are some crucial tweaks on the software side as well. For one, the Ioniq 5 is now fully capable of over-the-air (OTA) software updates for all its major electronic systems, whereas it was much more limited in that department before. Now, like the Ioniq 6, it's OTA-capable for bug fixes, new features and more. Hyundai has also added various suspension tweaks to make the EV more stable and agile, not to mention quieter—and the doors and B-pillar parts have been reinforced for added safety.
Last but not least, Hyundai's added an Ioniq 5 N Line trim here, which won't give you quite the explain-yourself-to-the-traffic-court-judge thrills that the Ioniq 5 offers, but will add a dash of needed sporty vibes inside and out.
Customers in Korea can order the updated Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N Line this month, while the rest of us will have to wait for it to ""gradually"" roll out to ""global markets throughout the year.""
Will you wait for the new one, or seize the exceptional deals that can be had on the current EV right now? I'll wait for the EPA range on the new battery to make that call, but one thing's clear: one of the best in the business just got better.

This Secret Ford F-150 Lightning Will Climb Pikes Peak,https://www.motor1.com/news/710790/ford-f-150-lightning-demonstrator-pikes-peak/,It could be a modified version of the F-150 Lightning Switchgear we saw earlier this year.,2024-12-25 09:04:47,"During Ford's big party in Charlotte to kick off the 2024 racing season, company CEO Jim Farley revealed a new ""EV demonstrator"" would tackle Pikes Peak. Details on that vehicle weren't mentioned, and for the most part, they still aren't mentioned. However, we at least know it will be an F-150 Lightning. But it won't anything you'll see at the local Ford dealership.
Ford shared a single teaser image on social media on Friday, showing the front of a vehicle hiding under covers. It's low, wide, and there's a wild wing at the back like the one on the bonkers electric SuperVan. In fact, if Ford didn't specifically say this was an F-150 Lightning, our minds would jump directly to some SuperVan iteration beyond the current 4.2 model. But this is a truck, and clearly, Ford is applying some of the lessons learned from its supremely fast van.
This hillclimb racer could be a variation of the Lightning Switchgear, a one-off prototype designed to explore performance envelopes both on- and off-road for the electric truck. We got up close with the Switchgear back in January, taking a ride in the off-road version with Vaughn Gittin Jr. at the wheel. It's called Switchgear because the same truck – with small changes to the suspension and tires – is designed to tackle paved corners the same way it tackles dirt jumps.
Ford didn't make two versions of the Switchgear, however. The same prototype accommodates both roles, which means we only saw the off-road version in person. During the event, a Ford rep told us it would be converted at a later date, which would be convenient timing for Pikes Peak.
The above rendering comes from Ford's Switchgear press kit, showing how the street version should look. Obviously there are quite a few differences between this and the teaser, notably that big wing and what could be strakes from the cab to the back, not unlike what we see on the SuperVan. If this new Lightning demonstrator is based on Switchgear, Ford is certainly taking it to the extreme.
Whether it's related to Switchgear or something completely different, we suspect this F-150 will be pretty darned quick going up the hill. This year's Pikes Peak Hillclimb is June 23, so expect more on this amped-up Lightning between now and then.

"The 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV Is A Hydrogen Plug-In Hybrid, For Real",https://insideevs.com/news/710194/honda-crv-hydrogen-plug-in/,"Meet a very different CR-V, and the first production plug-in hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle ever made. But can owners find fuel?",2024-02-27 09:00:48,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you melded the best qualities of a plug-in hybrid and a hydrogen-powered vehicle? (What's that? No? Okay, fair.) Well, Honda both asked that question and answered it with the 2025 Honda CR-V e:FCEV, a model it's calling ""America's first production plug-in hydrogen fuel cell vehicle."" It's a mouthful of a description for an intriguing new breed of zero-emission vehicle. And it's part of Honda's wider ambitions in the hydrogen space.
Allow me to explain what's going on here.
Hydrogen fuel-cell EVs
Hydrogen-powered EVs are a niche within a niche, and they only exist in California. They're quicker to fuel than regular electric cars, but a lack of reliable fueling infrastructure is holding them back.
The CR-V e:FCEV (the FCEV stands for fuel-cell electric vehicle) is an electric SUV that takes both electrons and hydrogen. Filling its 17.7-kilowatt-hour battery using an EV charger yields up to 29 miles of driving range, Honda says. Fueling the CR-V's tanks at a hydrogen station boosts its total mileage to an EPA-estimated 270.
The idea is one can plug it in at home and get enough inexpensive electric range to run daily errands, or they can fill it with hydrogen for longer journeys.
It's the same concept behind plug-in hybrids, which are something like a cross between an electric car and a conventional hybrid, like a Toyota Prius. Plug-in hybrids offer a few dozen miles of electric range married with the road-tripping convenience of a gasoline engine. Here Honda has swapped in a hydrogen fuel-cell system, which generates electricity using gas and produces water as a byproduct.
The e:FCEV will be available to lease in California later this year. There will be just one trim to choose from: Touring. In addition to the funky new powertrain, the new variant has exterior cues that make it stand out from other CR-Vs: a unique grill, liftgate and rear fascia, along with new body panels forward of the A-pillar.
Regardless of fuel source, the energy flows to a front-mounted motor producing a claimed 174 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. One standout feature: It also comes with the ability to share 1,500 watts of electric power with camping gear, power tools, appliances and more.
Cargo space may be disappointing for SUV buyers, though. The CR-V's hydrogen tanks protrude into the cargo area, effectively eliminating what looks to be a couple of large suitcases-worth of open space.
The CR-V e:FCEV uses Honda's second-generation hydrogen fuel-cell technology, which it co-developed with General Motors. Honda said the new tech is cheaper, more durable and higher performance than the system in the Clarity Fuel Cell, Honda's hydrogen vehicle that was discontinued in 2021.
Honda says it aims to make its car business carbon-neutral by 2040 through a combination of EVs and fuel-cell vehicles. But the automaker's hydrogen ambitions extend far beyond passenger vehicles.
Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said during a roundtable in January that EV technology is the ""optimum solution"" for making passenger cars carbon-neutral, whereas hydrogen will be more important for buses, trucks and stationary generators. Shinji Aoyama, the company’s global executive vice president, added that the upcoming CR-V is an important ""showcase"" of how Honda's fuel-cell tech is improving.
Honda is also working on hydrogen construction equipment and is researching hydrogen's potential as an electricity source in space, it said in a press release.
In short, fuel-cell passenger cars seem poised to remain only a small part of Honda's business over the coming years. But like several automakers, perhaps most notably Toyota, Hyundai and BMW, it's keeping that technology warm in case it takes off (including in non-U.S. markets) in the coming decades.
But the problem is less the car, and more of the fuel itself. Hydrogen stations are incredibly expensive to build—more so than even EV fast-chargers—so few fueling partners stepped up to help Honda and Toyota with their H2 dreams.
As a result, hydrogen-powered cars have been a niche for years. Save for some mishaps, they only exist in California, which is home to all of the country's 52 fueling stations. Their main draw is that their tanks take just a few minutes to fill up, just like a conventional car. Unlike a conventional car, though, they don't emit harmful tailpipe emissions. And you don't have to sit around for a half-hour waiting for your car to charge like you would with a standard EV.
Fuel-cell cars sound terrific on paper—until you try to fill one up. California's hydrogen stations are uncommon (increasingly so, apparently) and routinely out of order. The price of hydrogen has skyrocketed in recent years, although free fuel cards from automakers help offset that burden on drivers. Shell recently shut down all of its seven remaining hydrogen locations in California, citing ""hydrogen supply complications and other external market factors."" (And despite copious support from the Japanese government, hybrids aren't selling well there, either.)
The CR-V e:FCEV is, no doubt, an interesting piece of tech. And the fact that you can plug it in may make it more appealing than other hydrogen vehicles, which rely solely on public infrastructure. But the fueling experience will have to start improving to make it a truly attractive choice.

BYD Brings Denza Brand To Europe With Striking D9 Minivan,https://www.motor1.com/news/710022/denza-d9-minivan-europe-debut/,It's available as a plug-in hybrid and EV with a seven-seat layout.,2024-12-25 09:04:48,"The 2024 Geneva Motor Show kicks off today, and while most international brands are missing, there are a handful of European debuts. This D9 minivan marks the launch of Denza on the Old Continent. If the name doesn't ring a bell, it's a brand created by Chinese automaker BYD and Mercedes in 2010. Initially, the joint venture was 50:50, but the German luxury brand reduced its share to 10 percent in 2021 when Denza underwent restructuring.
BYD is paving the way for Denza in Europe by bringing the D9, a large people mover with a high-end interior to rival another posh minivan—the Lexus LM. It's not a completely new model since it initially went on sale in China in 2022. Much like in the People's Republic, the Euro variant can be had as a plug-in hybrid or as a full EV.
The three-row family hauler has a boxy shape, large electrically operated sliding doors, a generous greenhouse, and two equally polarizing grille designs. The imposing front end is just as striking as other new minivans, including the Volvo EM90 / Zeekr 009 and the Toyota Alphard / Vellfire twins. The boxy shape with a nearly flat roofline maximizes interior space and there's a large panoramic sunroof to make the cabin feel more airy.
Even though it's showcasing the D9 in Geneva, Denza remains tight-lipped about the technical specifications for now. However, look no further than the Chinese version to discover all the relevant numbers. It's 206.7 in (5,250 mm) long, 77.2 in (1,960 mm) wide, and 75.6 in (1,920 mm) tall, with a massive wheelbase of 122.4 in (3,110 mm).
Since Denza wants to lure you away from buying that luxury SUV, the D9 has an upscale interior with leather just about everywhere you look. The cabin has a 2+2+3 configuration with adjustable and folding seats, not to mention ventilation and massaging functions. Aside from the usual pair of screens in the front, there are extra displays mounted on the armrests of the second-row seats to control various functions.
In addition, there's a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens, along with a small fridge that can hold as many as six bottles. The captain's chairs in the middle slide fore and aft, offering copious amounts of legroom, while the grab handle on the B-pillars makes it easier to get in and out. Even rearmost seats get USB ports and a central armrest, along with LED ambient lighting, and speakers from the Dynaudio sound system.
While Denza keeps European specifications shrouded in mystery for now, the D9 sold in China can be had as a plug-in hybrid with a turbocharged 1.5-liter gasoline engine. The PHEV model is available with front- and all-wheel drive, along with a 20.39-kWh battery and a bigger 40.06-kWh pack.
The combustion engine is good for 137 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque (231 Newton-meters)) while the front-mounted motor is rated at 228 hp and 251 lb-ft (340 Nm). Go for the all-wheel-drive model and Denza throws in a rear-mounted motor that produces 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm). The FWD versions have a combined output of 296 hp and 421 lb-ft (571 Nm), good for a sprint to 62 mph in 9.5 seconds. Step up to AWD models and you're rewarded with a healthy 401 hp and 502 lb-ft (681 Nm) to cut the sprint time to 7.9 seconds.
In China, the Denza D9 electric model is also offered with a choice of FWD and AWD. Both have a front motor with 308 hp and 266 lb-ft (360 Nm). Upgrading to the all-wheel-drive model brings a rear motor producing 60 hp and 81 lb-ft (110 Nm) for a combined 369 hp and 347 lb-ft (470 Nm). The FWD variant takes 9.5 seconds to complete the sprint, or just 6.9 seconds if you go with AWD. Both share a 103.4-kilowatt-hour LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery pack.
As far as range is concerned, we should point out that the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) differs greatly from the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) used in Europe. The Denza D9 electric model with front-wheel drive promises to cover 385 miles (620 kilometers) while its all-wheel-drive counterpart can do 373 miles (600 kilometers). Maximum charging power is 166 kilowatts, in which case 15 minutes enables a driving range of 143 miles (230 kilometers).
The D9 isn't Denza's only model at the 2024 Geneva Motor Show since BYD's sub-brand also has the purely electric N7. It's a five-seater SUV with a height-adjustable air suspension, panoramic sunroof, and a maximum driving range of 354 miles (570 kilometers). It'll take 20 minutes to juice up the battery from 30 to 80 percent thanks to 230-kW charging capabilities.
Denza is scheduled to reach the European market near the end of the year.

"Fiat's Retro EV Future Includes Panda City Car, Truck, SUV, Camper",https://insideevs.com/news/710144/fiat-panda-electric-city-car-truck-suv/,"Starting July 2024, Fiat will introduce one new model each year through 2027, with pure electric, hybrid, and ICE powertrains.",2024-02-26 11:00:01,"Italy’s beloved Fiat Panda, the best-selling model in the country and Fiat's most popular model in the rest of Europe will morph into several new segments for global markets, Stellantis revealed today.
The Panda nameplate, synonymous with fun, compact, and frugal city cars in Europe is on track to expand into an entire family of pure electric, hybrid, and gas-powered models. These powertrains will go into a new City Car, SUV, camper, pick-up truck, and sporty fastback.
Fiat CEO and Stellantis Global CMO Olivier Francois indicated that the brand would showcase these concepts at the upcoming 2024 Geneva International Auto Show which begins on February 27, 2024, in the mountainous Swiss town. He said, “Fiat is working on a bigger and a better future. A future that is rooted in its Italian past, tradition, fun, sustainability, and social relevance.”
The Fiat Panda is Italy's best-selling car.
The Panda is extremely popular in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. And Fiat wants to bank on its success with a new range of pure electric, hybrid, and gas-powered Pandas that will take several shapes and sizes and ride on a brand-new ""multi-energy"" platform. However, no mention of a U.S. launch for now.
Stellantis revealed last year that it would introduce seven new affordable models on a new multi-energy low-cost Smart Car platform, different from STLA platforms. The Citroen e-C3 rides on this platform, which has been designed specially to democratize new-generation and affordable EVs and fend off the brutal onslaught of Chinese rivals.
“We are in the global game, and the next step will be to raise that global game with a set of new models,” Francois said. “[The new models will] conquer the streets, and complete our line-up in Europe, South America, Middle-East and Africa,” he added. The first model will likely be the immediate Panda successor, a slightly larger city car with a radical new design.
The design language would be based on Fiat’s birthplace, the Lingotto building in Turin, and its famous rooftop test track. And that means “oval shapes everywhere.” Additionally, all models would feature abundant recycled plastics, and fabrics made from bamboo, so that “ethics and aesthetics,” go hand in hand.
The City Car concept would feature what Fiat calls a self-winding charging cable to make plugging and unplugging easier. In the video, the cable pops out from the hood, connects to the charger, and seemingly retracts automatically. Other exterior design highlights include light steel wheels, pixel headlight modules, and the new four-stripes Fiat logo.
Fiat will also introduce a successor to the Strada truck, which is apparently the best-selling vehicle in Brazil. The concept seems to be a modern take on the traditional truck, with a modular bed and roof. In one frame, its pixel headlight modules come off and get mounted on the roof as adventure lights.
Other models include an “XXL sized” camper, a family-oriented roomy SUV, and a sporty fastback with a sloping roofline focused on performance. Francois said that Fiat will reveal the first production car in July 2024, with one model launching each year thereafter till 2027. Curiously, there was no mention of any of these models arriving in the U.S., not even the pick-up truck.
Europe, South America, and the Middle East seem to be the main markets for the Panda’s electric and hybrid offspring. “In Geneva, you will see many dream cars and concepts. But what I have just shown you is no dream. It’s reality,” he said.

Renault 5 Returns As Retrolicious EV With Up To 248 Miles Of WLTP Range,https://insideevs.com/news/709693/renault-5-ev-2024-specs-details-official/,The modern reinterpretation of the Renault Le Car can power your appliances and has Google Maps and Waze built-in.,2024-02-26 04:00:00,"This is the all-new Renault 5. An electric four-door hatchback that revives the iconic nameplate once slapped on France’s best-selling car–the same which was known as the Le Car in the United States for a relatively short stint in the 1970s.
It looks almost identical to the concept car that was unveiled in 2021, which says a lot about Renault’s confidence in its design department. We think it looks very cool, but you can chime in with your thoughts in the comments section below.
The quintessential French hatchback goes all-electric
The first-gen Renault 5 from the 1970s was France's best-selling car for a good number of years. In the U.S. it was sold as the Le Car and had far less success than in Europe. Now, though, there's an all-new Renault 5, and this time it's electric.
First, the specs. The all-new Renault 5 is based on the so-called AmpR Small platform, which was previously known as the CMF-B EV architecture. It’s intended for B-segment EVs and it will also be the foundation for the upcoming Renault 4.
More Stories Like This
The 5 will be available with two battery options, both using the Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) chemistry. The entry-level pack boasts a capacity of 40 kilowatt-hours and offers a WLTP driving range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), while the bigger option has 52 kWh and increases the maximum estimated range to 400 km (248 miles).
Renault says that the larger battery consists of just four large modules with 46 cells in each module, while the smaller pack has three modules, each with 31 slightly larger cells. This approach is different from that used on the discontinued Zoe hatchback, which uses twelve smaller modules, and helps save some 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in weight. The Renault 5’s big battery weighs about 280 kg (617 lbs) and the smaller one tips the scales at 240 kg (529 lbs).
Speaking of weight, the new urban EV has just 1,450 kg (3,196 lbs) when fitted with the 52-kWh battery pack, making it as light as some comparable internal combustion engine cars.
When it comes to size, the Renault 5 EV slots somewhere between the Twingo and Clio hatchbacks, measuring 3.92 meters (154.33 inches) long, 1.77 m (69.6 in) wide, and 1.5 m (59 in) tall. In other words, it’s about 10 inches shorter than the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV but the width and height are almost the same. The trunk has a volume of 326 liters (11.5 cubic feet) and by the looks of it, there's no frunk. However, the automaker says there's a special compartment in the trunk to store the charging cable.
The 5 is front-wheel-drive only and there are three power options: 70 kW (93 hp), 90 kW (120 hp), and 110 kW (147 hp). The first two can only be had in combination with the 40 kWh battery, while the most powerful motor only comes with the larger, 52 kWh pack. Going from zero to 62 miles per hour (0-100 kilometers per hour) takes less than eight seconds, according to Renault, presumably for the most powerful version.
All versions can be recharged from an AC source at up to 11 kW. As for DC fast charging, the car can accept up to 80 kW if it’s fitted with the 90 kW, while the top variant can accept up to 100 kW. A rather cool feature is a charging indicator on the hood.
Furthermore, the two most powerful versions of the Renault 5 come with vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality as standard, meaning owners can export power from the high-voltage battery to power things like appliances and tools. The maximum power output is 3.7 kW.
The French EV also comes as standard with Plug & Charge, which means the owner doesn’t have to swipe a card every time the car needs to be recharged, and vehicle-to-grid (V2L). The latter means the car can be used to inject power back into the grid when it’s convenient, price-wise. The first European markets where the Renault 5 owners will be able to use this feature will be France and Germany this year and the United Kingdom in 2025.
Inside, all versions of the compact EV come with a 10-inch central touchscreen that can run native Android apps like Spotify, Google Maps, Waze, and more. It also has wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. A second 10-inch screen (7-inch in the case of the entry-level trim) takes the role of a digital instrument cluster.
The design of the seats is inspired by the flame-throwing R5 Turbo and the fabric used to cover them is made from 100% recycled materials. The dashboard and door panels of some trims are also made from recycled plastic.
There’s also a virtual travel companion called Avatar Reno, which supposedly interacts with the driver and passengers, both inside and outside the car. And because it integrates with the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, it can reply to questions using basically the whole internet as its source of information.
Driving the Renault 5 is supposed to be quite fun, too, according to its maker. The EV boasts the same front suspension as the gas-powered Clio and Captur, while the rear gets a multi-link setup that’s usually found in larger and more expensive cars, according to Renault.
Adaptive cruise control with stop & go and lane centering are part of the pack and make for a Level 2-capable EV. This means that the car can partially drive itself but the driver is still responsible for everything and has to take over control when the vehicle says so.
The new Renault 5 E-Tech Electric will be built in France, where multiple factories will contribute to making the EV. The car will be assembled in Douai, while the battery pack will be initially made at the Ruitz factory before passing the torch to the Douai facility. Prices will start at around 25,000 Euro (roughly $27,000) without incentives and deliveries are set to begin later this year on the Old Continent.

Jeep Is Preparing Five New Or Refreshed Models For 2025,https://www.motor1.com/news/709929/what-jeep-is-planning-2025/,"The all-electric Wagoneer S goes on sale in Q3 2024, while the smaller Recon will launch by the end of the year.",2024-12-25 09:04:59,"2025 will be a big year for Jeep. It’ll have two battery-electric vehicles on sale and a larger lineup of plug-in hybrids. Jeep’s new CEO, Antonio Filosa, briefed the media Friday about the comapny’s plans for the upcoming year and its strategy to increase its market share.
The Jeep Wagoneer S will enter production in the second quarter of this year before going on sale in Q3 for a short 2024 model year run. It’ll be the fastest Jeep ever when it goes on sale, hitting 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S have 600 horsepower and ride on Stellantis’ scalable STLA Large platform, just like the new Recon, which should launch before the end of the year. Jeep wouldn’t provide specific dates for Recon’s production and arrival, but it will have its first full sales year in 2025 alongside the Wagoneer S.
Jeep’s lineup of 4xe plug-in hybrids will grow through next year. One model likely to arrive is the previously announced Gladiator PHEV, with Jeep planning to launch five new models or updated variants in 2025. The revamped lineup is part of the brand’s strategy to increase its market share in the US after five consecutive years of falling sales.
Ready For Off-Road Fun:
Jeep is already laying the groundwork for a successful 2025. It's lowered the prices of several models for 2024, including the Grand Cherokee and the recently updated Gladiator, and it’ll integrate the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer into the Jeep brand. The Wrangler also got an update for this model year. Filosa has also implemented a new team to improve quality and lower costs.

The Ineos Fusilier Is The Retro Electric Off-Roader Of Your Fantasies,https://www.motor1.com/news/709875/ineos-fusilier/,Ineos' second vehicle is a smaller EV with a range extender option and squared-off retro looks.,2024-12-25 09:05:00,"Ineos Automotive revealed on Friday its third vehicle, an all-electric SUV called the Fusilier. Like its first SUV, the Grenadier, the Fusilier sports a squared-off, retro-inspired design. In addition to a purely electric variant, Ineos will offer the Fusilier with a gas-powered range-extender option.
The Fusilier will deliver ""world-class off-road capability with zero compromise to on-road performance,"" according to Ineos. Shorter and lower than the Grenadier, the Fusilier will be built on a skateboard platform featuring a steel top hat, a steel underbody, and aluminum doors.
Ineos has yet to release details on the Fusilier's 4x4 powertrain, so we don't know things like battery size or range.
“As we developed this vehicle, we quickly concluded that in order to move towards decarbonization but continue making cars that consumers want to drive, we need a mix of powertrain technologies,"" CEO Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. ""BEVs are perfect for certain uses: shorter trips and urban deliveries, but industry and governments need to have realistic expectations around other technologies that can help accelerate the necessary pace of change.""
Going by photos released by Ineos, the Fusilier looks to have some real off-road chops, with all-terrain tires, a front skid plate, and high bumpers. The hood and door designs remind us of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class. According to Top Gear, the shorter, lower silhouette and things like active grille shutters were used to improve efficiency.
Ineos says it partnered with Magna to develop the Fusilier. The SUV will be built at Magna's facility in Graz, Austria. It joins cars like the G-Class, the BMW Z4, the Toyota Supra, and the Fisker Ocean as other cars contracted to be built by the company.
Expect more news from Ineos on the Fusilier's powertrain and launch details by Fall of this year.

"Mercedes-Benz Delays Its EV Plans, Will Keep Making Combustion Engines",https://insideevs.com/news/709767/mercedes-benz-delays-ev-plans/,"The company initially planned to be all-EV by 2030, but it said today that EVs will make up 50% of its sales by the end of the decade.",2024-02-22 18:28:40,"There’s no longer an expiry date on Mercedes-Benz combustion engines. Due to the recent trends of slower-than-expected demand for EVs, the German automaker is recalibrating its EV transition pace, cutting down the number of electric models it expects to sell by 2030 in half, the brand announced today in an investor statement.
Earlier, Mercedes-Benz had pledged to go fully electric by 2030, and permanently consign its combustion engines to the history books by then. But it now plans to continue selling ICE cars well into the next decade. It has halved its EV goals, and pure electric models and hybrids will account for up to 50% of its sales by 2030.
Mercedes-Benz wanted to go all-electric by 2030.
But that's no longer the plan. The pace of EVs has outpaced consumer demand, which is why several automakers are rethinking their EV approach. Widespread EV adoption is still in the pipeline, but probably not at the same pace as some previous forecasts.
“Unexpected developments may arise in particular from geopolitical events and trade policy,” Mercedes-Benz said in the statement. “Further supply chain disruptions and in particular, availability bottlenecks for critical components, remain a significant risk factor,” it added.
However, the brand would remain “strategically focused” and “tactically flexible,” as it awaits for demand to catch up, charging infrastructure to mature, and the supply chain to streamline. Following the latest development, the carmaker's stock price went up 5.9% and was also supported by a $3.3 billion share buyback program late on Wednesday.
Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen an EV on-slaught from the German automaker in Europe. Even in the U.S., Mercedes-Benz now offers six pure electric models, including the EQB SUV, EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs, and the opulent EQS SUV Maybach. It also sold a record number of EVs in 2023.
Even though Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius has pledged for his company to go fully electric, he has also stated that the internal combustion engine would die a natural death and that Mercedes-Benz wouldn’t transition “artificially.” In a nutshell, Mercedes-Benz ICE cars would continue to exist as long as customers want them.
How the carmaker plans to continue developing its electrified powertrains would be worth keeping an eye on. Reports emerged in August 2023 of Mercedes-Benz developing its M252 engine to function as a range-extender—a set-up where the engine works as a generator to charge the EV’s battery and functions independently from the electric motors that actually drive the wheels.
The Ramcharger, some Geely models in China like the Galaxy L7 SUV, as well as the BMW i3 and Chevy Volt are range extenders. The technology improves the EV’s overall driving range by reducing reliance on the battery alone, providing increased flexibility, and eliminating range anxiety for drivers. But the caveat is it still needs fossil fuels for power, which is quite contradictory to what the EV and climate movement is all about.
Next-generation Mercedes EVs are expected to ride on the Modular Mercedes Architecture (MMA), which would be designed for EVs and ICE cars as well. The production version of the new CLA, whatever it will be called in its final form, will be the first model to ride on the MMA followed by the next GLA and GLB models.

The Super-Cheap Dacia Spring EV Can Now Power Your Appliances Too,https://insideevs.com/news/709379/dacia-spring-ev-facelift-2024-specs-details/,"With incentives, this electric runabout can cost as low as $13,000 in some places.",2024-02-21 02:00:00,"The Dacia Spring might not ring a bell in the United States, but in Europe, it’s known as one of the cheapest electric cars on the market. It’s small, it doesn’t have a lot of range, and it’s not particularly powerful, but with a price as low as $13,000 (12,000 Euro) after incentives, it’s hard not to consider it when buying a new car for urban driving.
And now it’s better than ever because the Romanian (but Chinese-made) EV got its biggest overhaul yet, at least when it comes to looks. Oh, and it has a frunk now.
Dacia Spring gets a makeover
The Dacia Spring, which is one of the cheapest EVs available in Europe, got a significant facelift that brings V2L and new looks.
We’ll get the hard specs out of the way first because nothing changes compared to the outgoing model. There’s the same 27-kilowatt-hour battery (gross capacity) that enables a WLTP-rated range of around 140 miles (225 kilometers) and the same two electric motor options: 33 kW (44 hp) and 48 kW (64 hp).

Charging can still be done via an AC source at up to 7.4 kW, while DC fast charging–which is optional–tops out at 30 kW. According to Dacia, Spring drivers only travel an average of 23 miles a day, so these stats should be more than enough for short urban driving sessions.
That said, this second facelift (the first design tweaks were introduced last year when the more powerful motor also made an appearance) brings significant design changes and a very interesting feature for such an affordable car: vehicle-to-load (V2L). Granted, the output isn’t anything to write home about–roughly 3.5 kW (220 volts at 16 amps)–but it’s still better than nothing. With V2L, owners can use an adapter to power things like appliances and tools using the car’s battery as a sort of mobile generator.
Design-wise, almost everything is new, both inside and out. The front end now features Dacia’s signature Y-shaped LED daytime running lights while the rear gets segmented tail lights and a full-width black strip that includes the Romanian carmaker’s name.
The roof rails of the outgoing model are no longer offered, as Dacia says they’re not really needed for a city car, and by the looks of it, almost all body panels are new. However, Renault’s CMF-A platform that underpins the car is the same as before.
Inside, the refreshed Spring gets a 7-inch configurable instrument cluster on all trim levels and a 10-inch infotainment touchscreen on the center console on the most expensive versions. The entry-level variant gets an integrated smartphone holder instead of the 10-inch screen.
There’s also a redesigned center console, a new height-adjustable steering wheel (the old model didn’t offer any adjustment), and refreshed door cards, and the rotary gear selector has been replaced with a switch that has a B mode for energy recuperation. However, the manual handbrake handle is still there, for better or worse.
Dacia Spring (2024) interior
Dacia Spring (2023) interior
The facelifted Dacia Spring’s interior can also accommodate what the company calls YouClip accessories–things like cable ties, smartphone holders, and bag supports that clip into cutouts in the dashboard.
The size of the Spring remains largely unchanged. The length went down from 145.8 inches (3.73 meters) to 145.6 in (3.70 m), but the trunk capacity went up by 8% to 10.8 cubic feet (308 liters). Plus, there's a 1.23 cu ft (35 liters) frunk now that's big enough for the Level 1 charging cable.
Three versions of the Spring will be available in Europe later this year: Essential, which only comes with the 33 kW motor, Expression, which can be specced with either motor, and Extreme, which gets the more powerful 48 kW drive unit.
The outgoing model had a base price (without incentives) of around $24,900 (23,000 Euro). The prices of the refreshed Spring haven’t been announced yet, but we expect them to be similar to what was previously available.",Iulian Dnistran
"The New Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid Is Less Powerful, More Expensive",https://www.motor1.com/news/709282/porsche-panamera-4s-e-hybrid/,"536 hp for $126,800.",2024-12-25 09:05:02,"When Porsche introduced the third-generation Panamera last November, it only showed the base model with rear- and all-wheel drive alongside the hot Turbo E-Hybrid. Zuffenhausen is now diversifying the lineup by launching two additional electrified models. They're not traditional ""Turbo"" models, but they swap the big V8 in favor of a V6 and keep the pair of turbochargers.
The Panamera 4E Hybrid combines a 2.9-liter engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 463 horsepower and 479 pound-feet. Compared to its predecessor, the new model has gained eight mighty horses but has lost 37 lb-ft. Despite its heft, this is a seriously quick sedan (it's technically a hatchback) since it takes just 3.9 seconds to reach 60 mph, or 0.3s less than the model it's replacing. Flat out, it'll do an identical 174 mph.
The Panamera 4S E-Hybrid now has 536 hp and 553 lb-ft, which means Porsche has sacrificed 16 horses while carrying over the same amount of torque. It completes the sprint in 3.5 seconds as before, en route to 180 mph, down by 5 mph.
All electrified Panamera models share an upgraded battery pack with a capacity boosted by 45 percent to 25.9 kilowatt-hours without increasing the physical size. The battery provides juice to a beefier e-motor mounted within the automatic transmission, rated at 187 hp and 331 lb-ft.
Porsche isn't disclosing range details for the US-spec models for now. However, we know the European ones can travel on electric power for up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) in the case of the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and 92 kilometers (57 miles) for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. These WLTP figures are likely to decrease for the EPA-certified range.
In the US, Porsche wants $115,500 for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and $126,800 for the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid. The new models command a premium of $6,500 and $7,600, respectively. For your money's worth, an adaptive air suspension and matrix LED headlights are standard. To sweeten the pot, 14-way comfort seats, a heated steering wheel, soft-close doors, and lane change assist are included as well.
The order books will open in late March, and you'll pay an extra $1,995 for delivery and handling fees. The cars will hit dealers this fall.

The Cupra Born VZ Is An Electric Hot Hatch With 322 HP,https://www.motor1.com/news/709322/cupra-born-vz-debut-specs/,The Volkswagen Group is trying to spice up its EV offerings.,2024-12-25 09:05:02,"Spun off from the Volkswagen Group's SEAT brand in 2018, Cupra is introducing its first electric performance vehicle. The sporty derivative is based on the Born compact model and gets the ""VZ"" suffix, which is an acronym for ""veloz""—Spanish for ""fast."" The brand's first-ever EV gets a healthy power boost and other upgrades.
The rear-wheel-drive electric hot hatch uses an upgraded motor delivering 322 horsepower and a massive instant torque of 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters). These output figures represent a huge boost of 94 hp and 235 Nm (173 lb-ft) over the previous most potent variant of the Cupra Born. Courtesy of the newly unlocked electric oomph, the VZ variant shaves off a full second from the sprint to 62 mph (100 km/h), which now takes 5.7 seconds. Top speed has gone up by 25 mph (40 km/h) to 124 mph (200 km/h).
There's more to the Born VZ than a beefier e-motor since Cupra is also giving it a pair of exclusive 20-inch wheels, including a forged set with performance tires. The cooler alternative to the troubled SEAT brand has bumped the battery pack's net capacity by 2 kWh to 79 kWh for an estimated range of 335 miles (570 kilometers). The steering is sharper and there are additional tweaks to the suspension for better handling while the brakes feel more direct than before.
In terms of styling, Cupra is offering the new Born VZ in this Dark Forest color or you can play it safe by getting the feisty electric hatch in Midnight Black. The newly added “VZ” logo on the tailgate has a dark chrome look to echo the “Cupra” lettering. Inside, it gets a pair of body-hugging seats not shared with the lesser models. However, these bucket seats are already available in some performance cars with a combustion engine, including the Formentor VZ5 with its inline-five engine borrowed from Audi.
For the range-topping Born, Cupra has upped the infotainment's screen size by 0.9 inches to 12.9 inches. More important is the touch slider to adjust the climate and volume since it's finally illuminated. At an additional cost, buyers can get an optional 10-speaker, 425-watt Sennheiser sound system. As standard, the VZ variant gets paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel to choose from one of three levels of energy recuperation.
The Born VZ will go on sale in Europe in the third quarter of the year. Also in 2024, we should see its equivalent Volkswagen version, the ID.3 GTX, or whatever name the sporty electric hatchback will use. These two will compete in a rarified segment that includes the MG4 XPower. The smaller Alpine A290 will join them soon.

Volvo Renames The XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge To EX40 And EC40,https://insideevs.com/news/709294/volvo-xc40-recharge-c40-recharge-renamed/,"Now, all the EVs in the Swedish automaker’s portfolio start with the letter E.",2024-02-20 09:00:00,"The Volvo XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge were the first mass-produced battery-powered models made by the Swedish company. But since their introduction a couple of years ago, Volvo’s all-electric portfolio has been steadily growing and now includes names like the EX30, EX90, and EM90.
As you can see, there’s a naming difference between the oldest and newest offerings, and–to make matters worse–Volvo also sells plug-in hybrid versions of the XC40 and C40 that are also called Recharge in some markets. But not anymore.
Volvo goes all-in on the letter E
Volvo is renaming its first EVs to make it easier for customers to understand its all-electric portfolio. From now on, the XC40 Recharge EV will be known as the EX40, while its coupe-shaped C40 Recharge EV brother will go by EC40.
The Geely–owned Scandinavian automaker has officially renamed the XC40 Recharge EV to EX40 and the C40 Recharge EV to EC40, streamlining its naming scheme and making it easier for the customer to understand what’s being offered.
More Volvo Stories
Furthermore, the plug-in hybrid versions of the XC40 and C40 will no longer carry the Recharge badge and instead will go by the T6 or T8 suffix that’s used to reflect the different levels of power output.
Besides the name change, Volvo is introducing a new Performance software pack for the Twin Motor versions of the EX40 and EC40 which increases the power output by 25 kilowatts (33 hp) for a total of 325 kW (436 hp). The software upgrade also includes different pedal mapping for quicker acceleration response and a “Performance” drive mode.
The upgrade can bought by customers via the Volvo Cars smartphone app and then applied through an over-the-air software update without having to visit a service center.
Lastly, the Swedish automaker is introducing a special Black Edition of the EX40, EC40, and XC40 models that come with Onyx Black paint, high gloss black badging, 20–inch five-spoke alloy wheels in high gloss black, and the choice between microtech or textile charcoal interiors.
Last year, Volvo sold over 265,000 plug-in cars worldwide–113,000 all-electric vehicles (up 70% compared to 2022) and 152,000 plug-in hybrids (up 10%). By 2030, the Swedish automaker wants to have an all-electric portfolio.",Iulian Dnistran
The Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Is An Electric Passat Wagon With Up To 425 Miles Of Range,https://insideevs.com/news/709154/vw-id7-tourer-debut-specs-range-cargo/,"WLTP estimated range, that is. Plus, it comes with ChatGPT built-in.",2024-02-19 12:05:00,"Say hello to the all-new Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, VW’s first-ever series-production all-electric wagon. It has the same face as the sedan but a rear end that can fit a lot more stuff, making it a good choice for people who need more room to haul things on a daily basis, all while keeping the emissions level to zero. As long as they live in Europe, that is.
The ID.7 Tourer comes hot on the heels of another recent electric wagon unveil–the BMW i5 Touring–but unlike the BMW, VW’s offering should be a bit more affordable. We don’t know the official pricing of the new ID.7 Tourer yet (some estimates say it will start at around $50,000), but it’s sure to be less expensive than the roughly $78,000 BMW is asking for for the base i5 Touring.
The ID.7 EV gets a wagon makeover
This is the Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, the German company's first electric wagon. It comes with the same bells and whistles as its fastback-bodied sibling but has a larger trunk that can fit more stuff.
VW’s family hauler gets the same guts as its fastback sibling, meaning a choice of two battery packs. The entry-level ID.7 Tourer Pro gets juice from a 77-kilowatt-hour pack that can accept up to 175 kW of power from a compatible DC fast charger for a 10 to 80 percent top-up in about 28 minutes. The ID.7 Tourer Pro S gets a slightly bigger, 86-kWh battery that can be recharged at up to 200 kW, which means that going from 10 to 80% state of charge should take “significantly less than 30 minutes,” according to the German automaker.
More Electric Wagons
VW doesn’t say what the expected range of the entry-level battery pack is, but it does mention that the big pack has a “forecasted” maximum range of 685 kilometers (425 miles) on a full charge, presumably on the WLTP cycle, as the ID.7 Tourer won't make it to America. And if there’s something we know about range estimates, it’s that the WLTP figures are usually 20% more optimistic than the EPA numbers. In other words, the window sticker might say 340 miles of range if the electric wagon was to ever come stateside.
Whatever the battery pack, though, the ID.7 Tourer will be available with a single source of motivation in the form of a rear-mounted electric motor that makes 210 kW (281 hp) and 402 pound-feet (545 Newton-meters) of torque. It’s the same APP550 electric drive system that powers the sedan version of the ID.7 and is touted as being more powerful and efficient than the APP310 unit that powers the entry-level ID.3 EV.
Furthermore, the battery is automatically preconditioned for fast charging when using the so-called Electric vehicle Route Planner–just set a DC fast charger as a destination on the navigation system and the car will take care of the rest.
When it comes to hauling cargo, the ID.7 Tourer can accommodate up to 21.3 cubic feet (605 liters) of stuff with the rear seats in the cargo position (in other words, with the seatbacks in their most upright position), while the total capacity is 60.5 cubic feet (1,714 liters) with the rear seats folded and cargo up to the roof. With the rear seatbacks reclined, the cargo space is 18.7 cubic feet (532 l).
Just like the ID.7 sedan, the Tourer EV comes with a pretty long list of standard equipment including ED headlights and tail lights, an augmented reality head-up display, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, and the artificial intelligence bot known as ChatGPT, which can respond to all kinds of requests through the car’s IDA voice assistant.
As an option, the ID.7 Tourer can be specced with a smart glass panoramic roof that can be made opaque at the press of a button thanks to its polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) layer.
Interestingly, the ID.7 Tourer has exactly the same dimensions as the ID.7 fastback, which is pretty rare in the automotive industry. Both measure 195.3 inches (4,961 millimeters) long, 73.3 in (1,862 mm) wide, and 60.4 in (1,536 mm) tall, while the wheelbase is 116.9 in (2,971 mm). Usually, the wagon version of a sedan is longer, but not this time.
The Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer will go on sale later this year in Europe. Here in the U.S., only the fastback version of the ID.7 will be available starting in the second half of 2024.
Update: this article has been tweaked to better reflect the fact that the ID.7 Tourer will not be available in the United States.",Iulian Dnistran
The Cadillac Lyriq Gets Some Nice Upgrades In March,https://insideevs.com/news/709032/cadillac-lyriq-update-march/,GM paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV. But at least the Cadillac Lyriq launch is going more smoothly.,2024-02-16 17:30:02,"Cadillac Lyriq owners can expect some nice upgrades to their cars in March, General Motors said on Friday. It's a bit of positive news during the otherwise choppy rollout of GM's new electric platform.
The software update adds a few improvements. Perhaps most notably, Super Cruise, GM's hands-off highway-driving system, should require fewer interventions from drivers after the update. Similar improvements are headed for the Lyriq's hands-on adaptive cruise control feature, which automatically follows lane lines and keeps up with traffic—under driver supervision, of course.
Caddy's first EV
The Lyriq is the first Cadillac EV of many the brand plans to release in coming years. GM has hit some stumbles in its EV plans, but at least things are coming along for the Lyriq.
The upgrade also includes more convenient touchscreen controls for the garage door opener and glove box, along with better performance in the myCadillac mobile app.
The nice thing about today's software-heavy vehicles is that upgrading them with new and improved features is easier than ever. Interestingly, though, Lyriq owners will have to go to a dealer to receive this upcoming update. They won't be able to just download it through the internet.
GM's transformation into a fully zero-emission automaker hasn't been terribly smooth as of late. It struggled to ramp up production of EVs, that use its new Ultium battery technology, including the Lyriq. It recently paused sales of the Chevrolet Blazer EV after reports of software glitches. And it's delayed the launch of some new electric models, citing lower-than-expected consumer demand.
But the Lyriq is something of a bright spot. After a slow start to 2023, GM wound up selling 9,154 Lyriqs last year. That's not a huge number, but it beat out the automaker's other new EVs by a long shot.
GM sold just 482 Blazer EVs, 3,244 GMC Hummer EVs, and 461 Silverado EV pickups. It's worth noting here that GM's electric best sellers were the aging Bolt twins. The Bolt EV hatchback and Bolt EUV compact SUV were responsible for a combined 62,045 sales, but they've been discontinued (in their current iteration) to make way for GM's next-gen EVs.

It aims to build electric vehicles with advanced self-driving technology. Now, there are new details about when the company's first models will hit the road.
In addition to the previously announced Afeela electric sedan coming in 2025, Sony Honda Mobility will launch an SUV in 2027 and a less expensive compact model in 2028 or later, according to Nikkei Asia. All three vehicles will ride on the same platform.
Sony Honda Mobility's compact model will allegedly share components with Honda's in-house developed EVs to keep prices down. The company just showed off the Saloon concept at CES ahead of launching a production model in 2026.
We don't have many details about Sony Honda Mobility's SUV yet. Sony previously showed the Vision-S 02 concept (below) that previewed how such a vehicle might look. It shared a design language with the sedan but with a taller ride and a hatchback.
The Afeela sedan launching in 2025 uses front and rear electric motors, each making 241 horsepower. It has a 91.0-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Sales in the United States should start in early 2026.
Sony Honda Mobility is loading the Afeela with technology. The pre-production model has 45 sensors, including lidar and eight cameras. Chips from Qualcomm would allegedly provide the processing capability to support Level 3 self-driving, meaning a person would still need to take over control at times.
The Afeela has an understated, smoothly styled exterior. Inside, there's a screen spanning nearly the entire dashboard. Sony intends to provide access to its massive media empire so folks can watch movies like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse or play Fortnite on this display. The driver grips a yoke steering wheel.
Honda would build some of these EVs in Ohio, according to Quartz. Given the location, the vehicles might use the batteries coming from Honda and LG's joint venture factory in the state.

"GM’s Super Cruise Now Works On 750,000 Miles Of Roads",https://insideevs.com/news/708783/gm-super-cruise-update-2024/,The update nearly doubles the number of highway miles in North America where users can drive hands-free.,2024-02-15 11:13:32,"Super Cruise, General Motors’ advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), is getting a big update that will almost double the number of highway miles where owners of compatible cars can activate the feature.
Drivers of GM-made cars like the Cadillac Lyriq, Cadillac Escalade iQ, and GMC Hummer EV–just to name a few–will be able to use Super Cruise on 750,000 miles of highways in the United States and Canada by next year. The previous road network update, which came in 2022, had roughly 400,000 miles of compatible roads.
GM doubled the number of Super Cruise highway miles again
Owners of compatible GM-made cars will be able to use the company's Super Cruise hands-free driving assistant on 750,000 miles of highways in the United States and Canada. This latest update almost doubles the number of compatible miles that were previously available (the 2022 update included 400,000 miles of highways.)
General Motors claims that it has “the largest truly hands-free operating domain in North America.” If you’ve never heard of Super Cruise, think of it like Tesla’s so-called Autopilot, only instead of letting the car figure out what the road is like, GM mapped every single mile of compatible highway with the help of Lidar.

Besides features like changing lanes on demand or automatic lane changes–which tech-savvy drivers expect from such a system–Super Cruise also offers something called hands-free trailering. In other words, it enables hands-free driving on compatible roads while towing, which GM says is a first in the industry, and Super Cruise is still the only ADAS on the market to offer something like this.
This latest update adds minor highways that typically connect smaller cities and townships, and compatible cars have already started receiving new data over-the-air, with more to come through 2025.

As for the rest of GM’s portfolio, the company says that “the average eligible vehicle will update its map within about one month of the GM brand site maps showing updated roads.”
Super Cruise debuted in 2017 as a Level 2 semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on certain roads in North America. Then, in 2021, something called Ultra Cruise was introduced, which was supposed to be an even more capable version of the hands-free driving assistant, but that was ultimately retired and its functions will be included in Super Cruise.",Iulian Dnistran
The 2024 Ypsilon Is Lancia's First New Car In 13 Years,https://insideevs.com/news/708706/2024-lancia-ypsilon-ev/,The troubled Italian brand signals rebirth with its first-ever EV.,2024-02-14 16:30:56,"We never thought this day would ever come again, but here is a new Lancia. Stellantis has pledged to keep all 14 (fourteen!) brands in its vast portfolio following the FCA-PSA merger. That means the Italian marque is getting a new chance to repair its severely damaged brand image. The 2024 Ypsilon kicks off a long overdue rebirth.
It is also Lancia's first-ever EV, although mild-hybrid versions with gasoline engines will follow. The subcompact hatchback uses the same CMP / eCMP bones as the Peugeot 208 / e-208 but with entirely different styling inside and out. Some of the design cues were first seen last year on the Pu+Ra HPE Concept that had a bit of Stratos DNA.
Lancia tells us the headlights and taillights take after those of the iconic rally car but that's frankly a bit of a stretch. The circular rear lights do remind us of the Stratos, but so do other cars with round taillights. The Stellantis brand has integrated a ""Y"" motif into both front and rear lights, while the separate daytime running lights adopt a similar theme. To spruce things up, the wheel arches, side mirrors, and the rear pillar come with a glossy black finish.
It's worth noting the version depicted here is a limited-run special edition co-developed with Cassina, a high-end Italian furniture manufacturer. Consequently, lesser versions of the new Ypsilon won't look as glitzy as this. Compared to the Peugeot 208 and its regular rear door handles, Lancia has opted to ""hide"" them up in the C-pillar where you'll also notice the company's updated badge.
The interior is also a vast departure from its French cousin. However, since we're in 2024, the ""mandatory"" dual-screen setup is there. Thankfully, there's still a row of physical buttons to quickly access some of the climate controls. The dual displays measure 10.25 inches and Lancia has added a wireless charging pad, three USB-C ports, and smartphone integration with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The chic city car also has a bespoke sound system, ambient lighting, and a special filter for the AC to get rid of 99 percent of harmful particles.
At the heart of the 2024 Lancia Ypsilon in electric guise is a front-mounted motor good for 154 horsepower and 260 Newton-meters (191 pound-feet) of torque to match the Peugeot e-208. It uses an identical 51-kWh battery pack that has enough juice for up to 250 miles (403 kilometers) in the WLTP combined cycle. This electric motor and battery combo is also found in another related Stellantis product, the Opel e-Corsa.
At 4.08 meters (160.6 inches) long and 1.76 meters (69.2 inches) wide, the all-new Lancia Ypsilon is bigger than the outdated model it replaces. At 1.44 meters (56.7 inches) tall, it's slightly lower compared to its predecessor. Predictably, it's a lot heavier. The electric model tips the scales at 1,584 kilograms (3,492 pounds) but subsequent mild-hybrid gas versions will trim off some of the fat. Speaking of the chunky battery, it can be recharged from 20 to 80 percent in 24 minutes via a DC connection.
While the old Ypsilon was only sold in Italy, its replacement is going to be offered at more than 70 dealers across Europe. Belgium and The Netherlands will get the ball rolling in the middle of this year, with France and Spain to follow, and Germany in 2025. Lancia wants to attract a younger clientele (people aged 40-45) with its ""premium hatchback,"" which is the last model to get combustion engines.
After the Ypsilon, Lancia's resurrection will continue in 2026 when the ""Gamma"" moniker will be dusted off for a flagship model. It's going to be a fastback on the Stellantis STLA Medium platform and will measure nearly 4.7 meters (185 inches) long. In 2028, the ""Delta"" will return as a compact hatchback.
Both future models are going to be electric-only products since Lancia's goal is to sell only EVs from 2028. It means the yet-to-be-revealed Ypsilon with a mild-hybrid gasoline engine will be offered for only a few years.

"Fiat Abarth 600e Gets 240 HP, The Most Of Any Abarth Ever",https://www.motor1.com/news/708000/abarth-600e-reveal/,"Fiat tuner Abarth just revealed the new 600e EV. It's cool, but it likely won't come to the United States.",2024-12-25 09:05:07,"It was only a matter of time before the cute Fiat 600 got a sportier Abarth version. And here it is, the Abarth 600e, the most powerful car to come from the long-running Italian brand.
Abarth didn't confirm a ton of details in announcing the 600e, but did say that the EV makes 240 horsepower. That's a solid 85 hp increase over the smaller, 155-hp Abarth 500e. The Abarth 600e launches with the limited Scorpionissima edition, featuring a vivid coat of Hypersonic Purple paint. Abarth will build 1,949 examples of the 600e Scorpionissima in honor of the 75th anniversary of the company's founding year.
Other upgrades include wider tires on 20-inch wheels, a beefed-up braking system, and a mechanical limited-slip differential. And in typical flamboyant Abarth fashion there's a large ""Abarth"" decal just above the side sills and a neon-green-accented scorpion logo on the front fender.
This is not the first Abarth Seicento, though. Back in the 1950s and 1960s when Abarth was still an independent tuning and motorsports firm, it used the original Fiat 600 as a basis for a number of fascinating models. Some used modified 600 bodies with larger-displacement engines, while others, like the Fiat-Abarth 750, sported streamlined coachwork from Zagato.
Cool though the new Abarth 600e is, don't expect to see it in the US. While Fiat will bring the 500e EV here, it hasn't announced plans to do the same with the 600e.

2025 Porsche Taycan Configurator Lets You Play In A 938-HP Fantasy Land,https://www.motor1.com/news/707788/2025-porsche-taycan-configurator/,"Without much effort, it's easy to option up a Turbo S to $250,000.",2024-12-25 09:05:09,"There are few more reliable time-wasters than a Porsche car configurator. The limitless bounty of options make these perfect daydreaming tools. On Tuesday, Porsche revealed the heavily revised 2025 Taycan, and inevitably, we're playing with its configurator.
For this fantasy scenario, I've gone a little extreme with a Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo. Like myself, it's sporty and practical. While there's a great selection of standard colors available for the new Taycan, I went with Signal Yellow from the expansive Paint-to-Sample palette. It's a crazy $13,150, but I'm not spending real money here, so why not have some fun.
Signal Yellow is a lovely shade that was popular in early ""longhood"" 911s, and it's the perfect match for the optional ""Pepita"" interior trim. This houndstooth-esque cloth was also available in early 911s, and it's recently made a comeback as Porsche embraces retro colors and materials. And in the Turbo S, it's a no-cost option. I think it's fun to reference the original 911 with a car that has, uh, over 800 more horsepower.
Otherwise, I didn't go too crazy. I added Porsche's InnoDrive drive-assist system, surround-view cameras, ""Thermally & Noise Insulated Glass,"" and deleted the standard yellow paint on the brake calipers for gloss black. The only other big-ticket item is Porsche Active Ride, the automaker's new fully active suspension system, which costs $7,140. It's a lot of money, but a fascinating piece of technology.
When you add in the $1,995 destination fee, my Taycan costs a not-insubstantial $241,205. That's 911 GT3 RS money. Obviously, the Signal Yellow paint is a very expensive option, and getting rid of that brings the MSRP to $227,775... which is still a lot of money. But as I said before, the Porsche configurator lets us live in a wonderful fantasy land, and why not take full advantage? I bet you, dear reader, will too.

Ford's Developing A Cheap EV Platform To Fend Off Tesla And Chinese EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/707658/ford-cheap-ev-platform-farley/,"A small ""skunkworks"" team within Ford has been working on a low-cost EV platform for two years, Ford CEO Jim Farley said on Tuesday.",2024-02-06 18:53:44,"A small team within Ford has spent the last two years developing a low-cost platform for smaller electric vehicles, CEO Jim Farley said on Tuesday.
""We made a bet in silence two years ago,"" Farley told investors during the company's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call, describing the creation of a ""super-talented skunkworks team"" that operated outside of the ""Ford mothership.""
Affordability is a sore spot in the EV transition
Inexpensive, long-range EVs are tough to come by, and that's bad news for getting mainstream buyers to embrace electrification. Some automakers are working on cheaper upcoming models.
""They've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large install base for software and services,"" Farley said. He added that Ford is adjusting its spending to focus more on smaller electric vehicles.
Affordability is one of the key barriers keeping people from buying more electric cars—and keeping automakers from selling them in larger numbers. Today, most battery-powered cars carry premium price tags, and budget-conscious buyers have few options to choose from that cost less than $30,000.
None of Ford's current electric offerings are what one might consider ""cheap."" The Mustang Mach-E SUV starts at roughly $43,000, while the base F-150 Lightning pickup goes for over $55,000. More range and lusher appointments will cost you even more. Even so, Ford's EV business is far from profitable in these early days. (Its Model e division, dedicated to electric vehicles and related technologies, posted a $4.7 billion loss for 2023.)

The low-cost segment is an emerging battleground in the EV space. For years, Tesla has floated plans for a $25,000 vehicle. In January, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the firm's cheaper-to-build, next-generation vehicle platform will enter production in 2025. Farley said on Tuesday that cutting costs will be crucial for competing both with Tesla's upcoming cars and with Chinese manufacturers, which are beginning to export EVs worldwide and may come for the U.S. market next.
""All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost, and efficiency, in our EV products,"" he said. ""Because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs.""",Tim Levin
"The 2025 Porsche Taycan Gets Major Upgrades In Range, Performance And Charging",https://insideevs.com/news/707643/2025-porsche-taycan-specs/,"The Taycan Turbo S is now the quickest production car Porsche has ever sold, but charging and range may be the real wins here.",2024-02-06 18:01:00,"Performance was never the Porsche Taycan's problem. It is a Porsche, after all, and that's kind of what they do there. Instead, the German automaker's first all-electric effort never blew anyone way with its range. Granted, it was always positioned as a performance car first and foremost, and even something like a 911 Turbo S won't get amazing fuel economy. But Porsche says many of its more than 150,000 Taycan customers to date wanted to go the distance and spend less time charging, so that's what engineers wanted to deliver with an extensive 2025 model year update.
Meet the 2025 Porsche Taycan, which brings significant upgrades to range, charging times, efficiency and performance to the entire lineup.
Porsche's electric tip of the spear
First launched in 2019, the Taycan was Porsche's first all-electric effort—but not its last. Like the rest of the Volkswagen Group, Porsche has big plans for future EVs, including the new all-electric Macan. Now the Taycan gets some improvements for the next phase of its existence.
Unlike the all-new, all-electric Porsche Macan, the 2025 Taycan does not use the latest PPE platform. Instead, it rides on the same platform it's used since its 2019 debut—dubbed J1. But the revised Taycan does bring several major enhancements, including a new high-performance battery pack, a new rear-axle motor with more power, a modified pulse inverter, upgraded thermal thermal management with a new heat pump, and a tweaked all-wheel-drive system with more efficient regenerative braking. It also comes with more standard features than before, an expanded list of options and a slightly tweaked design with better aerodynamics.
This is the upgraded model that, in Taycan 4S trim, achieved an impressive 296 miles of range during a rainy, chaotic InsideEVs test drive. Other testers with better weather achieved far better results, including as much as 382 miles of range in internal testing of the base Taycan and up to 345 miles for the mighty Taycan Turbo.
Of course, official, EPA-estimated range figures are still forthcoming. But considering the outgoing Taycan was only rated between 200 and 242 miles of range, depending on the model, the 2025 update is sure to keep you on the road much longer. It's worth noting, however, that the last Taycan had one of the most conservative range ratings out there. In InsideEVs testing, multiple variants of the Taycan outperformed their official EPA range ratings by over 30%.
Porsche says that the 2025 Taycan will come in two body styles, the Taycan sedan and the slightly lifted, more wagon-like Taycan Cross Turismo. Both surviving flavors of Taycan get the same significant upgrades when they go on sale this summer.
The Sport Turismo model, which was previously only available here in GTS trim, will not be available for the U.S. market when the car launches, Porsche officials said.
Every Taycan model is at least 0.6 seconds quicker to 60 mph than the car it replaces. The base rear-wheel-drive Taycan sedan now accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, down from 5.1 seconds on the outgoing car. The range-topping Taycan Turbo S does even better; it can now move from zero to 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds, making it ""the quickestproduction car Porsche has ever offered.""
I'm putting that in quotes so you know I'm not making it up, but that alone is a staggering achievement. (Especially for a car that doesn't even have a turbocharger.)
We also know that the Taycan Turbo S develops up to 938 horsepower, but power output specs for the other models have not been released. Pricing details have, however, and can be found in the chart below.
And though our recent range test was mostly straight-line highway driving, the Taycan is unlikely to be any sort of slouch in the handling department. The 2025 models all include an adaptive air suspension as standard, and the new Porsche Active Ride suspension can be ordered as an option for all models with all-wheel drive. That's a fully active system with motors that can pump fluid in and out of each damper on the fly, offering a remarkably versatile and super-controlled handling experience.
Here's what Porsche says about that system, which is also available on the Panamera:
The suspension keeps the body of the Taycan level at all times, even during dynamic braking, steering and acceleration. With a smooth ride, the system absorbs bumps almost completely. In dynamic driving situations, the Porsche Active Ride suspension aims for an optimal connection to the road thanks to a balanced distribution of wheel loads. If the appropriate mode is activated, the suspension can compensate for pitching and rolling motions in order to reduce the acceleration forces acting on the occupants.
Sounds like a good time.
But plenty of expensive EVs can drive fast. The big news here is how much better this Taycan is in terms of range and charging speeds than the car it replaces.
Porsche says top Taycan models can be had with a larger 105 kWh Performance Plus battery pack, up from 93 kWh on the last Taycan. ""We increased it 12% [in size] and we changed the chemical density, therefore it's more powerful than before,"" Taycan program director Steffen Christian told me recently. ""It helps with the performance and it helps with the range as well.""
The smaller battery pack gets an upgrade as well. Previously a 79 kWh unit, the Performance Battery now has a capacity of 89 kWh. That's standard on the Taycan and Taycan 4S; the larger Performance Battery Plus is an option for those two. Meanwhile, the 105 kWh unit is standard on the Turbo and Turbo S models, as well as all Cross Turismo models.
No matter which battery you choose, the Taycan can take a lot of juice. Provided you can find such a DC fast charger, the car can charge at speeds of up to 320 kW, up from a max of 270 kW with the old Taycan. We even saw slightly higher numbers than 320 kW during our range test, although the cars had a 350 kW Electrify America stall all to themselves when we achieved those speeds.
Porsche added that all Taycan variants, regardless of battery size, can charge from 10 to 80% in 18 minutes ""under ideal conditions,"" which again tracks with our testing last week. Between the overall charging speed and the time used to do it, this now makes the Taycan one of the quickest-charging EVs for sale in the U.S. Credit to the Taycan's 800-volt electric architecture. Porsche also says the 2025 model gets a 150 kW DC/DC converter to better optimize charging speeds on 400-volt networks.
Finally, the Taycan now recovers 30% more energy during braking than before, up to 400 kW from 290 kW. One-pedal driving remains unavailable, as Porsche—like the rest of the Volkswagen Group—finds coasting to be better for efficiency and the overall driving experience than the alternative setup found on competing EVs.
On the outside, the enhancements fall under ""blink and you'll miss it."" The headlights are slimmer than before, but Christian told me they also slightly improve the car's aerodynamics too. The Taycan always sported a handsome silhouette; designers didn't need to mess with much, and they didn't. It does come in a number of new color options.
The inside also gets some subtle tweaks, including two new leather-free upholstery options, a standard Mode Switch toggle on the steering wheel, a ""push-to-pass"" temporary speed-boost button there similar to other Porsches, video streaming for the central and passenger displays and a revised software interface.
More features that were previously options on the Taycan are now standard. Those include Lane Change Assist, a heated steering wheel, ambient lighting, the intelligent range management system on the navigation, a new cooling system, wireless device charging and more.
As impressive as its range and charging performance was last week, we only got a few hours' seat time in the updated 2025 Porsche Taycan. We'll know a lot more when we get to test it in Europe later this year.
In the meantime, Porsche's O.G. electric effort has clearly matured from an impressive first draft to an on-paper masterpiece—one of the quickest-charging, longest-driving EVs on the market and one with performance far and above most rivals. Porsche may be busy getting everyone amped about the new electric Macan, but it may have also made the Taycan one of the most advanced EVs you can buy right now.

Correction: Porsche mistakenly said that the Taycan sedan models would be available in the course of the summer this year, while Cross Turismo models would follow in the fall. The automaker now says both body styles are expected to arrive this summer.

The BMW i5 Touring Is The Electric Wagon You Want But Can't Have,https://insideevs.com/news/707102/bmw-i5-touring-electric-wagon-forbidden-fruit/,"Unless you're in Europe, of course. There’s also a plug-in hybrid version of the German wagon that’s a solid “nein” in the U.S.",2024-02-06 18:01:00,"The BMW i5 is the all-electric version of the world-famous 5 Series sedan, and now–for the first time–there’s also a battery-powered version of the 5 Series wagon. Plus, the German company is offering a plug-in hybrid version of said wagon both in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive guises.
Bet let me get to the bad stuff first. Neither the BMW i5 Touring nor the 5 Series Touring plug-in hybrid is coming to the United States, with a previous press release shredding Americans’ dreams of ever getting their hands on the electrified wagons with the following sentence: “The unique combination of sporty elegance, modern functionality, and locally emission-free driving pleasure is developed specifically for the automotive markets in Europe as well as in Japan and Taiwan.”
The 5 Series wagon goes all-electric
The BMW i5 Touring is the German company's first-ever series production all-electric wagon. It comes with a bigger trunk than the sedan but, unlike the sedan, it won't be offered in the United States. In fact, none of the 5 Series' wagon options are available here.
BMW is referring to all the powertrain options available for the 5 Series Touring, which include plug-in hybrid gasoline options, mild-hybrid diesel burners, and all-electric trims. That said, it doesn’t mean we can’t dream–an all-electric wagon, especially one that’s branded as a premium product, is somewhat of a unicorn in the automotive industry.
We could say that the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo is sort of a wagon, and there’s also the Nio ET5 Touring that’s available in China and Europe, but that’s about it. Sure, the MG5 exists, but that’s marketed as an affordable electric wagon, and Volkswagen's ID.7 Tourer isn't on sale yet.
So, what does the i5 Touring offer? Well, a bigger trunk than its sedan sibling, for starters. BMW says the wagon has a cargo volume between 570 and 1,700 liters (20.1 to 60 cubic feet), irrespective of the powertrain version. By comparison, the i5 sedan–which is sold in the United States–has 490 liters or 17.3 cubic feet.
This, together with the different body style, is the only thing that separates the electric wagon from the sedan. The battery, electric motors, charging capabilities, and gizmos are the same.
The base i5 Touring carries the eDrive40 badge and comes with a single rear-mounted electric motor that makes 230 kilowatts (308 horsepower) in day-to-day driving conditions and 250 kW (335 hp) when My Mode Sport mode is activated. The same goes for the torque, which is rated at 295 pound-feet (400 Newton meters) but goes up to 317 lb-ft (430 Nm) for a short period when Sport Boost or Launch Control is enabled.
The WLTP driving range of the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring is between 300 and 348 miles (483 to 560 kilometers).
The most powerful version of the zero-emissions wagon is called the i5 M60 xDrive Touring and comes with a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for 380 kW (509 hp) most of the time and up to 442 kW (592 hp) when you choose to live dangerously. Torque is also higher, with 586 lb-ft (795 Nm) available all the time and up to 604 lb-ft (820 Nm) when M Sport Boost or My Mode Sport is active.
But with more power usually comes less range, and it’s no different for the i5 M60 xDrive Touring, which can travel between 276 and 314 miles (445 to 506 km) on a full charge.
More Electric Wagons
Speaking of charging, the i5 Touring accepts up to 205 kW of power from DC sources and up to 11 kW from an AC source (a 22 kW onboard charger is also available as an option).
On the plug-in hybrid front, the 5 Series Touring comes in either 530e or 530e xDrive guise, both of which combine a 2.0-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor to make a combined output of 220 kW (295 hp) and 332 lb-ft (450 Nm). The all-electric driving range is between 49 and 59 miles (79 to 96 km) on the WLTP cycle thanks to a 19.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The all-electric i5 comes with an 81.2-kWh high-voltage pack.
Pricing for the BMW i5 Touring starts at 72,200 Euros in Germany, which is about $78,600 and includes VAT.

Rivian Will Finally Reveal The R2 Electric SUV On March 7,https://insideevs.com/news/707427/rivian-r2-unveil-on-march-7-2024/,Rivian’s R2-platform EV will be made in Georgia and is expected to rival the Tesla Model Y.,2024-02-05 13:31:57,"Roughly two and half years after California-based electric vehicle start-up Rivian launched its first models—the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV—the brand now appears to be poised to unveil its next big EV on March 7, 2024.
It’s been a long time coming. We already know that the upcoming model will wear some sort of R2 badging, but the exact model names remain undisclosed. What we do know is that the first R2 model will be a mid-size SUV or crossover, and likely lock horns with the Tesla Model Y, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and more.
Rivian's more affordable car has an official reveal date.
California EV startup Rivian's first two models—the R1T truck and R1S SUV—earned a reputation for being quirky and fun to drive. But with a starting price of over $73,000, they are out of reach for most people. With the R2 models, Rivian hopes to target a larger audience.
Given how obsessed America is with crossovers, evident with the Model Y’s astronomical sales, it’s logical for Rivian to set its sights on this immensely popular segment. The extent to which the R2 EV might pose a threat to the Model Y will depend on several factors, including pricing, range, fast charging capability, and the brand’s ability to deliver volume sales, among others.
Rivian’s current offerings, the R1T and R1S have a starting price of $73,000 and $78,000, respectively, before fees and tax incentives. These prices make them out of reach of the masses. But Rivian hopes to sell the R2 EV at a much lower price point. CEO RJ Scaringe indicated previously that Rivian hoped to fill a “vacuum” in the $45,000-50,000 price range.
The R1T and R1S are manufactured at Rivian’s inaugural plant in Normal, Illinois. The R2 models are expected to be manufactured at a second site, a brand new $5 billion factory east of Atlanta, Georgia. Rivian earlier indicated that it intended to start production of the R2 models in 2026 after the Georgia plant’s completion.
The upcoming R2 model will also use Tesla’s proprietary charging connector. Rivian confirmed in June 2023 that its future models will get the NACS charging port, giving owners access to thousands of additional charging stations across the U.S. That’s pretty much all we know so far about the R2 EV. Further details will follow in due course.

Volvo Stops Funding Polestar As Geely Prepares Bailout,https://insideevs.com/news/707036/volvo-stops-funding-polestar-geely-new-significant-shareholder/,"The two companies will continue to collaborate on R&D, manufacturing, and sales.",2024-02-01 13:11:38,"Volvo Cars will discontinue funding all-electric performance brand Polestar, the Swedish carmaker said today in its 2023 financial statement. Describing this move as a “decisive transformation phase,” Volvo plans to reallocate funds from Polestar towards its own projects. The decision comes in the wake of a 43% increase in Volvo's profits in 2023, a record in its 97-year history, the company claims.
Both Volvo and Polestar are subsidiaries of China's Zhejiang Geely Holding group. Under the new agreement, Volvo intends to transfer a portion of its 48% stake in Polestar to parent company Geely, which will become a ""significant"" new shareholder in Polestar. Geely has promised to provide “full operational and financial support to Polestar” going forward.
The difference between Polestar and Volvo is rather confusing
Polestar was originally launched as a more performance-oriented, BEV-only, and exclusive sibling to Volvo. But with Volvo's own EV plans taking off successfully, and Polestar struggling, the line between the two brands has blurred.
It’s worth noting that Geely’s 79% stake in Volvo Cars remains unaffected by this development.
2023 was a record year for EV sales for most brands in the U.S., including Volvo. The automaker sold 113,419 BEVs in 2023 globally, a 70% increase compared to 2022. That figure includes the 35,000 plug-in cars (including PHEVs) it sold in the U.S., of which 13,609 were fully electric models. EVs represented 16% of its total global sales volume.
However, the story at Polestar has been somewhat different. It announced early this week that it was laying off 15% of its global workforce to reduce costs. It also struggled to meet its delivery targets in 2023. Despite the setbacks, it said that the rollouts of the Polestar 3 electric performance SUV and the Polestar 4 coupe were imminent.
More Volvo News
“Volvo Cars’ and Polestar’s strong operational collaboration across R&D, manufacturing, after-sales, and commercial will continue to benefit both companies,” Jim Rowan, the president and CEO of Volvo Cars AB said. Volvo is bullish on its 2024 outlook as well, stating that it expects a higher year-over-year growth rate in its retail sales in 2024 compared to 2023.
Volvo's 2023 EV sales are based only on two models, the C40 Recharge and the XC40 Recharge. However, this year, Volvo is on track to expand its EV portfolio with the EX30, the smallest and the fastest Volvo ever, its bigger sibling the EX90, which is a full-sized electric SUV, and the EM90 MPV which Volvo cheekily describes as the ""Scandinavian living room on wheels.""",Suvrat Kothari
Toyota Is Developing New Combustion Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/706930/toyota-developing-new-combustion-engines/,The company chairman believes people should have a choice rather than being forced to buy EVs.,2024-12-25 09:05:15,"Toyota sold more cars in 2023 than ever before but electric vehicles had a minimal impact on the growth. Of the 11,233,039 vehicles delivered by the Japanese conglomerate, only 104,018 were EVs. Just 0.926 percent of the cars sold by Toyota, Lexus, and the other subsidiaries last year were battery EVs. With that in mind, the company reckons there's still a need for combustion engines.
During a speech held in front of 200 corporate managers and executives, Chairman Akio Toyoda reaffirmed plans for a ""major engine development project."" His statement is in line with an announcement made at the 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon where he ""used the opportunity to tell everyone that we're going to keep doing engines.""
During the Q&A session, Toyoda expressed his belief that battery EVs will never exceed a market share of 30 percent, regardless of technological advancements. As a result, the remaining 70 percent will be represented by gasoline cars, hybrids, and fuel cell EVs. The firm's chairman also mentioned that hydrogen-burning combustion engines could potentially offer a solution. Diesel was not mentioned.
While addressing questions from journalists, Toyoda didn't solely focus on decarbonization. He also touched on the delicate matter of jobs:
""If we suddenly shift to BEVs, I'm sure the 5.5 million people in Japan's auto industry who have spent their lives working on engines will start to question, 'What was it all for?' Some of our engine-related suppliers can't even get banks to lend them money.""
We've reached the point where the announcement of a new combustion engine comes as a surprise. In 2024, automakers are predominantly focused on revealing plans for new EVs. Some even go as far as claiming they'll cease production of ICE cars in the coming years. For instance, brands like Jaguar, Chrysler, Lotus, Aston Martin, Bentley, Buick, Cadillac, Rolls-Royce, Genesis, Maserati, Mini, Opel/Vauxhall, and Volvo have committed to becoming purely electric by the end of the decade. Even Toyota's Lexus brand has pledged to halt sales of cars with combustion engines by 2035.
In Europe, Stellantis promises to sell only EVs by the end of the decade. Mercedes also intends to go fully electric on the Old Continent by 2030 but only ""where market conditions allow."" Archrival Audi will stop making cars with combustion engines in 2032. BMW has not set a cutoff date yet. The Volkswagen core brand aims to only make EVs in Europe from 2033.
Toyota sees things differently, as it believes battery EVs can't be the sole solution to achieve carbon neutrality. Akio Toyoda mentioned that the charging infrastructure is far from being ready, pointing out that ""a billion people live without access to electricity"" worldwide. Since Toyota sells cars in those regions, going all-in on EVs wouldn't make sense.

"BMW Brings 5 Series Plug-In Hybrid To U.S., i5 Gets Another Trim",https://insideevs.com/news/706869/bmw-5-series-phev-i5-xdrive40-us-launch/,"The new variants make for a comprehensive 5 Series line-up for the U.S., offering customers gas, PHEV, and BEV options.",2024-01-31 13:00:06,"BMW is expanding its 5 Series model line-up in the U.S. with a new plug-in hybrid variant and a new i5 trim. Additionally for 2024, BMW is also adding Level 2 driver assistance capability to some existing U.S. models.
Currently, there are two variants of the BMW i5 available to order in the U.S.: the rear-wheel-drive i5 eDrive40 with 335 horsepower and a starting price of $66,800 (excluding delivery fees), and the mighty i5 M60 with 593 hp and an MSRP of $84,100.
The U.S.-bound xDrive40 will slot between the two trims mentioned above. It comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive, with a total system output of 389 hp and 435 pound-foot of torque. BMW says the i5 xDrive40 will sprint from 0-60 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds, 0.5 seconds faster than the RWD model, but slower than the ferocious M60 which does the job in a neck-snapping 3.7 seconds.
Enabling this raw performance is a battery with 84.3 usable kilowatt-hours, which delivers an EPA-estimated range of 295 miles on the eDrive40 and 256 miles on the M60. Expect the incoming xDrive40’s range to be somewhere in between those two figures.
The i5 supports 11-kilowatt AC charging, and up to 205 kW of DC fast charging, the latter enabling 10-80% state of charge (SoC) in under 30 minutes, provided there’s a functional and fast enough charger around. As with pretty much every other carmaker in the U.S., BMW will also adopt Tesla’s NACS connector, so i5 owners should have more charging options in 2025.
Moving on, BMW has also confirmed the stateside arrival of the 550e xDrive plug-in hybrid. The PHEV launched in Germany in September 2023, alongside the 530e which the U.S. won’t get. The 550e is powered by a 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder engine mated to a 197-hp electric motor. Combined system output is 483 hp and 516 lb-ft.
Its 19-kWh battery allows an all-electric range of up to 55 miles on the European WLTP cycle. Expect the EPA figure to be lower than the optimistic WLTP number.
BMW will also add Highway Assistant to its $2,500 Driving Assistance Professional Package. It will allow hands-free driving with supervision at speeds up to 85 mph. It will also enable active lane change with eye activation where the car can suggest a lane change, and the driver can confirm simply by looking in the outside rearview mirror. However, this feature will only be available for certain models produced from March 2024 onwards, and that includes the i5.
The production of the 2025 BMW i5 xDrive40 will begin in March 2024 at BMW Group Plant Dingolfling in Germany. The model will cost $71,095 in the U.S., including delivery and handling fees. The production of the 550e PHEV will begin in July 2024, and pricing and additional details will follow at a later date.

All-Electric Mini Aceman Aces Testing In Extreme Temperatures,https://insideevs.com/news/706651/mini-aceman-extreme-temperature-testing/,The British company’s smallest crossover will show its uncamouflaged face in China in April.,2024-01-30 18:01:00,"The all-new Mini Aceman, which is basically the electric crossover version of the latest-generation Mini hatchback, is on the last leg of its development process after completing all the necessary tests in extreme temperatures.
For extreme cold, engineers took the all-electric Aceman to the Arctic Circle to put the charging system, battery thermal management system, and electric motors to the test. Then, the battery-powered crossover was shipped to the desert to do the same–but this time in temperatures of up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).
Mini gets the Aceman EV ready for prime time
The Mini Aceman, which is the British automaker's smallest electric crossover, is getting ready for its world premiere in April after completing the extreme conditions testing procedures.
It’s a vital part of a new vehicle’s development process that should ensure the car can withstand just about any treatment once it goes on sale. It’s a standard practice among established automakers and Mini is no exception here. Only in this case, it’s probably more important than with any other model in its refreshed lineup to make sure everything is right from the get-go.
The Aceman will be Mini’s smallest crossover, and as we all know, the world loves cars that look like SUVs, even if they’re actually smaller than a compact hatchback. Measuring 160.4 inches long and 69 in wide, the Aceman is 9 inches shorter than the soon-to-be-discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EUV and slots between the new Mini hatchback and the new Countryman crossover (which is now based on the same platform as the BMW X1).
Set to be unveiled in April at this year’s Auto China car show, the first-ever Mini Aceman will be available in two power versions, both front-wheel-drive only. The Aceman E will be powered by an 181-horsepower electric motor that gets juice from a 40-kilowatt-hour battery pack, resulting in a WLTP-estimated range of 186 miles. The more expensive Aceman SE will get 215 hp and a larger, 54-kWh battery pack that enables a driving range of 249 miles on a full charge.
Mini’s entry-level electric crossover will be built in China by Spotlight Automotive, a 50:50 joint venture between the BMW Group, Mini’s parent company, and Great Wall Motor. In 2026, Mini’s plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, will also begin manufacturing the electric three-door hatchback and the battery-powered Aceman. That said, we still don’t know if the Aceman will make its way to the United States.

The 2025 Electric Jeep Wagoneer S: First Look Inside,https://insideevs.com/news/706726/all-electric-jeep-wagoneer-s-interior/,The interior looks “tech-focused” with four screens and upmarket materials.,2024-01-30 16:30:12,"Jeep has released the first interior images of its forthcoming all-electric SUV, the 2025 Wagoneer S. We’ve seen its Range Rover Velar-like exterior before with its slim headlamps and a sharply raked rear windshield, along with some iconic Jeep elements like the seven-slot grille, which is now illuminated on the Wagoneer S. The newly released images reveal additional details about Jeep's first dedicated battery electric vehicle for its home market.
The Wagoneer S will ride on parent company Stellantis’ BEV-specific STLA-Large platform (pronounced “stella”), which is also expected to underpin the Recon, the Wrangler-inspired electric SUV. Stellantis regards this platform as highly modular and scalable, as it supports FWD, AWD, and RWD configurations and can also house two different sizes of battery pack: 85 kilowatt hours or 118 kWh. The Wagoneer S will likely get the larger battery, but the range hasn’t been confirmed yet.
Inside the Wagoneer S, there’s ample digital real estate. The images reveal four large screens mounted across the dashboard: a large digital gauge cluster, a massive central infotainment display (which for some reason is playing a poignant song called “Moment of Surrender” by Nick Mulvey), and a dedicated screen in front of the co-driver’s seat, keeping up with the trend of passenger displays on many new luxury and premium software-defined EVs. The fourth screen is under the central display, and it appears to house the climate, seat, and massage functions.
The Wagoneer S also gets a shiny drive-selector knob with a silver metallic finish, and a terrain selector with Sand, Snow, Eco, Auto, and Sport modes, all housed on a piano black panel on the central console. There’s also a dual-pane panoramic sunroof, a “segment-exclusive” McIntosh 19-speaker audio system, and a color-selectable ambient light strip that runs across the door panels and the dashboard.
Early this month, Jeep said the Wagoneer S would pack 600 horsepower, and accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds. If that’s true it would certainly be among the fastest electric SUVs out there—and unlikely to be affordable. Expect more details to surface in the months ahead. It'll launch in the fall of 2024, with electric SUVs like the BMW iX and Rivian R1S in its crosshairs.",Suvrat Kothari
The 2025 Mazda CX-70 Delivers Straight-Six Power In A Two-Row Package,https://www.motor1.com/news/706547/2025-mazda-cx-70-first-look/,Turbocharged inline-six and plug-in hybrid powertrains make the jump to the five-seat SUV.,2024-12-25 09:05:28,"Mazda is doubling down on mid-size SUVs with the 2025 CX-70, a new variant of the CX-90 with seating for five instead of seven. The new SUV shares its platform, powertrains, and most of its bodywork with its larger sibling, meaning if you like the three-row, you’ll probably like the two-row as well.
Still, there are a few detail differences between the Mazda mid-sizers. For starters, the CX-70 is styled with a little more sportiness in mind, with greater use of gloss black than the chrome-laden CX-90. The grille gets a black mesh design in place of the CX-90’s brightwork, and the front bumper is different, with larger simulated grilles leading to the air curtain generators in the corners. The rear bumper also gets a new design, with faux vents on the corners. Dark finishes appear on the mirror caps, door handles, and roof rails, and the available 21-inch wheels get gloss black pockets and machined faces.
The front end looks more aggressive and appealing to my eye than the CX-90, whose flowing grille insert looks a bit swollen, like it got punched in the nose. However, the CX-70 still has a rounded roofline, which doesn’t sit quite right with the flowing bodywork and triangular rear quarter windows. There’s a bit of 1990s Taurus in the decidedly ovoid rear hatch, although the revised bumper design helps chisel out some visual verve.
Inside, the CX-70 looks remarkably similar to the CX-90, at least before you realize there isn’t a third row. Available red leather with a black accent stripe is a CX-70 exclusive, joining an otherwise black interior with contrasting red stitching on the door panels and steering wheel. Gray plastic trim with a printed carbon fiber motif detracts from otherwise excellent materials though, and I hope Mazda will offer the CX-90’s “kakenui” dashboard stitching and genuine wood trim, at least as an option.
Relative to the CX-90, the CX-70 has most of the same equipment, although it's the first Mazda to include Amazon Alexa integration in the infotainment system. It gives voice control to some on-board functions, like climate controls and infotainment, and it also syncs up with Amazon-capable in-home equipment. The CX-70 also has Unresponsive Driver Support as part of its adaptive cruise control and lane-centering functionality; if the person behind the wheel isn’t responding to an escalating set of prompts and warnings (as in the event of a medical emergency), the car will come to a gradual stop in its lane and activate its hazard lights.
The CX-70 uses the same powertrains as the CX-90, with a turbocharged 3.3-liter inline-six producing 280 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque in base form or 340 hp and 369 lb-ft for the high-output S. A plug-in hybrid powertrain is also available, making 323 hp and 369 lb-ft via a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 17.8-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, and 68-kilowatt electric motor.
Rear-biased all-wheel drive is standard across the board, with a 5,000-pound towing capacity for the six-cylinder and 3,500-pound cap for the hybrid. The CX-70 will be incrementally lighter than the larger CX-90 (final specs have yet to be announced), so it might also be a bit more efficient. An electric-only range of about 30 miles for the PHEV would be a tidy little upgrade, ditto a combined fuel economy rating of 26 miles per gallon for the six-cylinder.
The CX-70 rides on the same 122.8-inch wheelbase as the CX-90, and it's also nearly the same length – a Mazda representative confirmed that the revised bumpers may affect dimensions by a few tenths of an inch. But since it doesn’t have to accommodate a third-row seat, the CX-70 has a massive cargo area with extra storage below the floor. I was able to lay out completely flat and still had room above my noggin and below my toes, stoking the imagination for a cross-country journey, sleeping at rest areas and campsites along the way.
Mazda Goes Big:
Mazda hasn’t announced pricing, but it’s fair to assume the CX-70 will be a bit cheaper than the $40,970 CX-90 and $51,320 CX-90 PHEV. Plan on spending about $38,000 for a base-model CX-70, rising to $57,000 or so with every box ticked. The somewhat dated Honda Passport, by contrast, starts at $43,295 including destination, with the flagship Black Edition trim costing $49,365. The stately Toyota Crown Signia will also compete in this space, though pricing for that 243-hp hybrid hasn’t been announced either. The 2025 Mazda CX-70 will arrive in dealers later this year.

Porsche's New EV Macan Offers Fake Vroom Vroom Sounds For $490,https://insideevs.com/news/706536/porsche-macan-ev-engine-sound/,What would you pay to make your EV louder?,2024-01-29 15:54:28,"Porsche's first electric SUV is here. And if you're afraid that trading in your gas-fueled Macan for the upcoming battery-powered version will take all the fun out of owning a Porsche, fret not. The Macan Electric isn't your ordinary EV, offering up the option to blast theatrical, synthetic acceleration noises at passersby.
""Porsche Electric Sport Sound"" will cost you $490 on top of the new Macan's starting price of $78,800 (before a delivery fee). It's part of a laundry list of add-ons that can push the model's total price tag north of $160,000.
Fake engine sounds, coming to an EV near you
Porsche's first electric SUV isn't alone in this. Several car companies are pumping artificial acceleration noises into—and out of—their inherently quiet electric cars to make the driving experience more familiar and dramatic.
The option, listed under ""Performance"" in the Macan Electric's online configurator, ""enhances the vehicle’s own sound and makes it sound even more emotional—both outside and inside the vehicle,"" Porsche says. Owners can toggle the sound on and off as they like using the Macan's central screen.
Like many of the artificial propulsion soundtracks offered in today's EVs, ""Porsche Electric Sport Sound"" sounds like a cross between an alien spaceship and a combustion engine. It's equal parts futuristic drone and familiar rumble.
EVs are inherently quiet, making driving one a remarkably tranquil experience. But that's also led some companies to experiment with artificial acceleration sounds to fill the void and appeal to car buyers who might miss the drama of loud, sputtering gas engines. Typically, those soundscapes are pumped into the cabin via speakers, but some manufacturers are interested in making their EVs noisy to the outside world as well.
More Porsche Macan Stories
Porsche is one of them. Its Taycan electric sports sedan also offers a sound package. Drivers of Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N, a high-performance electric SUV, can choose from a range of different sound profiles that mimic the swelling sound of gear shifts—even though it has a single gear. Dodge, known for its thunderous V8-powered muscle cars, showed off an electric concept car that's nearly as loud as a jet engine.
The new Macan is massively important to Porsche and the wider Volkswagen Group it belongs to. The small SUV is one of Porsche's top sellers, and the upcoming model debuts the VW Group's Premium Platform Electric architecture, which will underpin future EVs from both Porsche and Audi. All eyes will be on the Macan to see how that platform functions following all sorts of software stumbles and delays from VW.
It's not just about making it work. It's also about getting customers excited and keeping people safe, which is where the phony exhausts come in. Not only do they make EVs more entertaining, they could also save your life.
A 2022 study compared how pedestrians react to oncoming electric and gas-powered vehicles. It found that people were way worse at judging the time to collision for EVs accelerating toward them. Maybe making EVs sound a bit louder and more familiar could help.",Tim Levin
Maserati Confirms Quattroporte EV Coming In 2028,https://www.motor1.com/news/706170/maserati-quattroporte-ev-coming-2028/,Three other electric models will be launched before the flagship sedan.,2024-12-25 09:05:29,"Basically confirming the reports from last week about the delayed development of the Quattroporte Folgore, Maserati has shined more light on its EV strategy. It is now official that the electric version of the sedan is planned for release in 2028, but a few other battery-powered products should arrive before that.
The first to be launched will be the GranCabrio Folgore, which is scheduled to be unveiled later this year, closely following the release of its internal combustion engine counterpart. The company's commitment to the electrification journey extends well beyond 2024 with a zero-emissions version of the MC20 due in 2025. A large electric SUV - likely a BEV version of the Levante - is coming next in 2027, before the Quattroporte Folgore hits the market in 2028. Maserati describes all these models as 100 percent designed, developed, and manufactured in Italy.
""Driven by our Modena heart, we are going full throttle to lead change on electrification, with two of our iconic models already available for purchase in their 100 percent electric versions, and another on the way this year,"" Davide Grasso, Maserati CEO, comments. ""We will offer our preferred customers the most powerful Maseratis ever, pushing the boundaries of driving pleasure to a new era.""
The two electric products Grasso is referring to are the GranTurismo Folgore and Grecale Folgore, both of which are already on sale in the European Union. Maserati, under the Stellantis umbrella, became the first Italian luxury brand to focus on developing and producing all-electric vehicles. The Italian firm has also been participating in Formula E since 2023.
Driving Some Of Maserati's Latest Products:
The automaker’s electrification initiative is part of the larger Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan unveiled on March 1, 2022. The strategy positions the luxury brand as a fully-fledged segment within the organization matrix, ensuring that all new models from the marque will feature electric powertrains.
Not everything looks bright for Maserati, though. Stellantis will reportedly temporarily lay off 1,000 production workers at the firm's Mirafiori factory in Turin, Italy, from February 12 to March 3. This is the plant where Maserati produces the Quattroporte and other models.

Fisker Ocean Braking Issue That Prompted NHTSA Probe Was Fixed With An OTA Update,https://insideevs.com/news/706226/fisker-ocean-braking-issue-ota-software-update-nhtsa-probe/,The California-based EV startup claims it issued the software update in December 2023.,2024-01-26 14:00:01,"Fisker, the maker of the all-electric Ocean SUV, said it fixed the braking issue that prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to open a preliminary investigation after it received several complaints alleging the battery-powered crossover could display a partial loss of braking when it hits low traction surfaces.
According to an official document published by the American automaker on its website, the potential problems that led to the NHTSA’s preliminary evaluation were fixed with a software update that was issued last month.
Modern problems require modern solutions
Fisker used the power of over-the-air (OTA) updates to fix a braking issue that prompted the NHTSA to open a preliminary investigation after it received consumer complaints about the Ocean EV exhibiting reduced braking performance in some scenarios.
Here’s what the company said:
The Fisker Ocean brake system uses both friction braking and regenerative braking. In December 2023, Fisker responded to customer feedback and issued an Over-the-Air update (Version 1.10) to the regenerative system that improved the customer experience when traveling over bumps and uneven surfaces, resolving the issue. The Fisker Ocean brake system meets or exceeds all US and international performance requirements.
According to the NHTSA, it received nine consumer complaints about braking performance in the 2023 Ocean SUV. The complaints allege that a partial loss of braking can occur over low traction surfaces without alerting the driver, resulting in longer stopping distances. One complaint alleged a crash and injury, the federal investigation said.
The issue seemed to lie with the so-called blended braking function, which combines the friction braking system with the regenerative braking feature. About 4,000 cars out of the total 4,700 Ocean SUVs that were delivered last year are linked to the braking issue.
Fisker is in a hard spot right now. Last year, it slashed its production output at the Magna factory in Austria so that it could keep some cash on hand for the following months, and reduced its production guidance several times before that. That’s not exactly encouraging news for the EV startup. Neither is the fact that more than half the cars it made in 2023 were undelivered.
That’s partly because the direct sales approach used thus far didn’t quite live up to the expectations, which is why the California firm wants to add dealer franchises to its sales pitch. With help from dealers, it hopes to move all the remaining inventory of over 5,000 cars by the end of the first quarter–but only if enough dealers sign up.

"2024 Porsche Macan: A Daring Electric Redesign With 630 HP, More Range Than Taycan",https://insideevs.com/news/705983/2024-porsche-macan-electric-features-prices/,"With rear-axle steering, new-generation software, and more power and range, the second-gen Macan brings plenty to the table.",2024-01-25 07:30:00,"After selling 800,000 units of the first-generation Macan worldwide since 2014, Porsche breathes a new life into its best-selling model today in the form of a compact all-electric SUV. Meet the reborn Porsche Macan, now powered by batteries.
It's been a long time coming. Over the past few years, Porsche engineers have been driving Macan prototypes in deserts, through extreme winter in Northern Europe, and on public roads and racetracks, covering more than 2.1 million miles in testing alone. And they seem to have traveled everywhere with big fat cameras, making sure enthusiasts know what’s in the pipeline. Turning such a crucial model into an EV is a huge move for Porsche and the Volkswagen Group—a real test of its often-troubled plan to go all-electric in the coming years.
The Porsche Macan is a hugely important EV for the VW Group
The Macan has been Porsche's sales volume driver for years. It now debuts a new dedicated Volkswagen Group EV architecture called the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), gets more power and range, and offers a new generation of software that's crucial to the company's future.
This second-generation model, officially called the Macan Electric, will co-exist alongside its outgoing counterpart—and that car will keep internal combustion power for a bit. “The gas-powered Macan will continue to be sold in its current form as long as customer demand requires and/or regulations permit. We are happy to be able to offer our customers a choice of powertrain in this case for the foreseeable future,” a Porsche spokesperson told InsideEVs.
It’s an important EV for the brand that comes at a critical time. Not only does it debut Volkswagen Group’s Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture, but it also comes after several delays emerging from troubles at Cariad—VW Group’s software arm—when the likes of Tesla and several Chinese players have leaped forward with software-defined EVs.
The Macan Electric measures 188.4 inches long, 84.7 inches wide (with mirrors), and 63.8 inches tall, which is marginally longer and wider than the first-gen model, although the height remains identical. The wheelbase (113.9 inches) is 3.4 inches longer than the previous model, resulting in short overhangs at the front and rear to accommodate the floor-mounted lithium-ion battery.
It appears chic and athletic in pictures. The four-point DRLs are reminiscent of the Taycan, and Matrix LED lights—a highly sophisticated set-up that can dim or deactivate individual LEDs to avoid glaring other drivers while still illuminating the road ahead—are optional.
It has a remarkably low drag coefficient of 0.25—only slightly higher than the Taycan with 0.22 Cd, and almost as good as the Audi e-tron GT with 0.24 Cd. What makes this possible are several active elements: an adaptive rear spoiler, active cooling flaps on the front air intakes, air curtains below the headlight module, and a generally aerodynamic design, Porsche claims.
Other interesting design elements include frameless doors, a buffed-up shoulder line, and the characteristic coupe-like roofline which it carries over from the first-generation Macan.

The electric SUV will be available in two variants, Macan 4 and Turbo, both equipped with dual motors. The Macan 4 makes 402 horsepower and 479 pound-foot of torque, while the Turbo is good for 630 hp and 833 lb-ft. Those numbers would give all gas-powered Macan variants a run for their money. (As with the Taycan, the name ""Turbo"" must refer to speed and Porsche's heritage, since it obviously does not have a turbocharger.)
The Macan 4 accelerates from naught to 62 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds, while the Turbo slingshots in a neck-snapping 3.3 seconds. Top speeds are limited to 137 mph and 161 mph, respectively.
InsideEVs reviewed a near-production prototype last year in California, and we came out seriously impressed. Back then, contributor Tim Stevens wrote, “Dropping the Macan into Sport mode delivers an immediate and noticeable change in character. The throttle response immediately sharpens, and the suspension likewise stops being so soft and starts getting real.” He added, “The harder I pushed, the better it responded, really coming alive when I twisted the mode dial over to Sport Plus.”
Enabling this performance is a 95-kilowatt-hour usable battery capacity (100 kWh gross)—it’s only slightly larger than the optional Performance Battery Plus (93.4 kWh) on the Taycan, but much larger than its standard offering (79.2 kWh). Thanks to 800-volt architecture, it can charge at 270 kilowatts and is capable of adding a 10-80% range in 21 minutes, assuming it gets plugged into a fast enough DCFC.
The battery can deliver a range of up to 381 miles on the Macan 4 and 367 miles on the Turbo—but that’s on the European WLTP cycle which is slightly more optimistic than the EPA ratings here in the U.S. WLTP ratings are estimated to be 22% higher than EPA ratings, so going by this measure, expect the U.S. range to be around 300 miles for the regular version and slightly below that for the Turbo.
Those figures would still be substantially better than the Taycan, whose EPA ratings range between 200-246 miles depending on the variant and model year.
The new Macan can be configured to feature up to three screens: A free-standing 12.6-inch, curved gauge cluster, a 10.9-inch central display, and an optional 10.9-inch screen for the co-driver. What’s also new is the head-up display with augmented reality technology.
Porsche says AR elements such as navigation arrows will be visually integrated and the image would “appear to the driver at a distance of 32.8 feet and corresponds to the size of an 87-inch display.”
The new-generation infotainment system is based on Android Automotive OS (something we know works superbly in Volvos) and is also compatible with Apple Car Play.
We’ll have to wait and see how clean and responsive the user interface is on the new Macan, and the software experience is certainly something to look out for in early reviews of the final product. VW Group’s software division Cariad was comprehensively restructured in 2023 (including 2,000 job cuts) after users reported system freezes and unresponsive touchscreens on some VW EVs. That delayed the development of Cariad’s E3 1.2 software platform, as well as the Macan and the related Audi Q6 e-tron—both crucial cars for the VW Group.
The optional rear-axle-steering gives it a turning circle of 36.4 feet, almost as good as a Toyota Corolla. This feature will set you back by slightly over $2,000, and driving enthusiasts might find value in it. As Stevens said in his review, “[the rear steering system] is paired with an even sharper variable steering ratio to make the car feel almost too eager to get to the apex, a feeling that is utterly addictive.”
Thanks to the adaptive air suspension, the standard ground clearance of 7.2 inches can be raised to 8.8 inches. It also drives all four wheels thanks to dual motors, and Porsche's electronic traction management can respond to wheelspins in just 10 milliseconds.
Both variants are available to order in the U.S. The Macan 4 starts at an MSRP of $78,800 and the Macan Turbo is priced at $105,300, excluding delivery and handling fees. It will be manufactured at Porsche Plant Leipzig in Germany, alongside the Panamera and the gas-powered Macan.
U.S. deliveries will begin in the second half of 2024, and the electric SUV will take on rivals like the BMW iX, Genesis Electrified GV70, and the Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, to name a few.",Suvrat Kothari
The New Volkswagen Golf Plug-In Hybrids Have 62 Miles Of Electric Range,https://insideevs.com/news/705728/vw-golf-plug-in-hybrid-ev-range-2024/,The electrified versions of the German hatchback can also accept up to 50 kW of power from a DC fast charger.,2024-01-23 18:01:00,"The facelifted Volkswagen Golf is officially here, and while the all-electric version hasn’t magically reappeared in the German company’s lineup, the plug-in hybrid versions of the hatchback got significant improvements.
As before, the two plug-in Golfs are called eHybrid and GTE, the latter being a sort of electrified version of the iconic GTI.
The new plug-in hybrid Golf seems like a great choice for commuters
The facelifted Volkswagen Golf in plug-in hybrid variety offers up to 62 miles of all-electric range (in the WLTP test, we assume). It can also be recharged at up to 50 kW and has a maximum range of about 620 miles with a full tank of gasoline.
Both are powered by a 1.5-liter TSI eco2 gasoline engine that works in tandem with an electric motor that gets juice from a 19.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. According to Volkswagen, both versions can drive for up to 62 miles on electricity alone (on the WLTP cycle, we assume) and up to 620 miles in hybrid mode.

Recharging the high-voltage battery can be done from an AC source at up to 11 kilowatts, or from a DC fast charger at speeds up to 50 kW.
Power-wise, the eHybrid makes a combined 201 horsepower, while the GTE ups the figure to a more hot hatch-like 268 hp, which is actually 6 hp more than what the GTI is capable of with its 2.0-liter engine. The eHybrid and GTE transfer power to the wheels via a six-speed dual-clutch gearbox (the GTI has a seven-speed DSG).
That said, we’ll only get the Golf GTI here in the United States, making us a bit envious of Europeans who can get their hands on the plug-in hybrids. That’s because they went through some serious upgrades that make them a compelling choice for drivers who spend time both in cities, where the all-electric range comes in handy, and on long trips, where the gasoline engine can alleviate the range anxiety that some EV owners experience on high-mileage trips.
Compared to the previous iterations, the new plug-in hybrid Golf versions have a high-voltage battery that’s 9.1 kWh bigger (19.7 kWh vs. 10.6 kWh previously), more all-electric range (62 miles vs 50 miles on the outgoing models), a slightly bigger gasoline engine (1.5 liters vs 1.4 liters before), and about 27 hp extra in the case of the GTE.
The charging speeds are also higher. The outgoing models could top up at 3.6 kW from a home charger (the new ones go up to 11 kW), and DC fast charging was non-existent.
Inside, there’s a new infotainment system that runs on VW’s fourth-generation MIB4 system. It brings new graphics, a new menu structure, and it’s simpler to operate than its predecessor.
Two screen sizes will be available for all of the new Golf versions, either a 10.4-inch touchscreen or a 12.9-inch unit as the top-of-the-line option. Beneath the screen, there are illuminated touch sliders for temperature and volume control, but they lack haptic feedback and there are no other physical knobs that can be used instead.
Volkswagen Golf GTE (2024) interior
Outside, the facelifted Volkswagen Golf features newly designed LED headlights, slightly revised LED taillights, and a new front bumper, so you’ll still be able to easily identify one if you see it down the road. Optionally, so-called performance headlights will be available as part of a package that includes a horizontal LED light strip in the radiator grille and an illuminated VW badge. Because BMW and Mercedes-Benz can’t be the only ones offering light-up logos on their cars, right?
But what about those plug-in hybrids? We think they would have a place here in the U.S. where long commutes are typically the name of the game. Let us know in the comments if you agree.",Iulian Dnistran
The New Porsche Macan EV Bares It All In Design Sketches,https://www.motor1.com/news/705532/porsche-macan-ev-design-sketches/,"Plus, Cadillac intends to show an electric V performance car in 2024.",2024-12-25 09:05:33,"Porsche shows the Macan EV in revealing design sketches, and Cadillac announces an electric V.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
2025 Porsche Macan EV Design Sketches
It's safe to say that Porsche has never generated this much hype around a new product. Finally debuting on January 25, the next-generation Macan is being teased one last time in surprisingly revealing images. The design sketches complement the official photos fully showing the interior that were released at the end of last year.
Don't let the evolutionary styling trick you into believing the new Macan is related to the gas model. It sits on a different platform developed from day one exclusively for EVs. From the details released thus far by Porsche, the top version is going to have over 600 horsepower and 738 pound-feet (1,000 Newton-meters) from a dual-motor setup. The juice is going to be provided by a large 100.0-kilowatt-hour battery that can handle 270-kilowatt charging.
Porsche describes the 2025 Macan as a sporty crossover with a ""striking design"" and equipped with all-wheel steering. It'll be offered with a rear electronic locking differential and a sophisticated air suspension with two-valve dampers. Following its debut on Wednesday, it's slated to go on sale later this year when Audi will launch its equivalent model, the Q6 E-Tron.
While an official announcement has yet to be made, the Macan EV is widely believed to supersede the gasoline version in the European Union. Porsche apparently won't be allowed to sell the current crossover for much longer in EU countries because of forthcoming cybersecurity regulations.
Cadillac To Show Electric V Later This Year
The V series is about to enter the electric era as Cadillac has announced a zero-emission performance vehicle will break cover later this year. The disclosure was made during a media roundtable, where journalists were asked to ""stay tuned"" for an electric V model. Cited by Automotive News, a company spokesperson said enthusiasts should look forward to ""performance variants no matter the propulsion.""
It's unclear whether Cadillac was referring to a production model or a concept. Regardless, the CT4-V and CT5-V sedans along with the Escalade-V SUV with their powerful combustion engines will be complemented sooner or later by a hot EV. 2024 is an important year for GM's luxury brand and the V Series since it marks 20 years since the first production model, the 2004 CTS-V.

"BMW, Like Tesla, Will Use Humanoid Robots At Its U.S. Car Factory",https://insideevs.com/news/705378/bmw-figure-robots-car-plant/,"Between moves from Tesla and now BMW, it looks like AI-powered robots may have a place building cars of the future.",2024-01-19 15:01:37,"BMW is taking a page out of Tesla’s playbook by experimenting with artificially intelligent human-like robots at one of its car plants. Figure, a California startup developing said humanoids, announced a deal with BMW on Thursday to “deploy general purpose robots in automotive manufacturing environments.”
Of course, robotics in car manufacturing isn’t anything new. Car companies have steadily automated the way vehicles are built over the years. But the machines currently in operation are programmed to do one thing over and over—like move a door panel from here to there or weld this to that. Figure’s robots, on the other hand, would be able to do a whole bunch of different tasks that are overly tedious or unsafe for human workers, the company says.
Will humanoid robots take over jobs at automotive factories?
BMW, like Tesla, thinks that humanoid robots have a spot at automotive factories. They may, but don't expect them to perform complex tasks anytime soon.
""Single-purpose robotics have saturated the commercial market for decades, but the potential of general-purpose robotics is completely untapped. Figure's robots will enable companies to increase productivity, reduce costs, and create a safer and more consistent environment,"" Brett Adcock, Figure’s founder and CEO, said. Adcock also founded Archer Aviation, an electric air taxi company.
BMW and Figure will identify where robots can fit into the carmaker’s manufacturing processes before letting them loose—in stages—at the carmaker's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. That’s where BMW assembles the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and XM SUVs.
More BMW News
Standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall, the Figure 01 can carry 44 pounds, operate for five hours on a full charge and walk at a speed of 2.7 miles per hour. Figure, which emerged from stealth in 2023, aims to deploy the robot across industries like warehousing, logistics and retail to start.
Tesla is working on a similar robot called Optimus, which it plans to unleash on its factory floors to do manual labor. Elon Musk has said Optimus could also serve as a personal butler and that Tesla’s robotics division will someday eclipse its car business. (By the way, Hyundai already employs camera-equipped robot dogs from Boston Dynamics, which it owns, to do quality control.)
In the auto world, human jobs are already under threat by regular-old automation and the rise of electric cars, which are simpler to build and require less labor than their combustion-powered counterparts. If humanoid robots become smart, skilled and, crucially, cost-effective enough for car companies to use in significant numbers, we could see the automotive workforce erode further. For what it's worth, Figure says on its website that there are 10 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and that it sees robots as a solution for filling roles people don't want.
The robot takeover of complex manufacturing processes isn't happening tomorrow; Figure’s robot just learned how to make coffee.
Granted, it learned how to use a Keurig, basically the simplest coffee machine to operate on the planet. But the fact that it learned to do so just by watching people make coffee for 10 hours is extremely cool and impressive. See it in action here:",Tim Levin
"EV Jeep Wagoneer Hits 60 In Just 3.5 Seconds, Has 600 HP",https://www.motor1.com/news/705195/jeep-wagoneer-s-ev-teaser/,"Jeep's first US-bound electric vehicle is a high-powered Wagoneer, set for a fall 2024 launch.",2024-12-25 09:05:36,"Jeep announced Thursday it plans to launch its first US-bound electric vehicle, the Wagoneer S, in the fall of 2024. To go along with the announcement, the brand released a short teaser video, a single image of the car, and a couple of impressive stats: 600 horsepower and a 0-60 time of ""around"" 3.5 seconds.
The Wagoneer S is exclusively a battery-electric vehicle, says Jeep. It'll come with Jeep's 4xe-branded all-wheel drive as standard, along with the company's all-terrain management system.
There's no word on battery size, trims, motor tech, or pricing for the Wagoneer S right now. We suspect Jeep will trickle out more details as the fall 2024 on-sale date approaches. The SUV will go on sale in the US first before hitting ""key markets around the world"" later on.
Jeep says the design of the Wagoneer S has been ""driven by aerodynamic efficiency."" The lone teaser photo shows a head-on shot of a more streamlined, less blocky structure than we'd normally see on a Jeep. The two blade-like side inlets on either side of the lower bumper remind us of the items found on another upcoming, US-built electric SUV, the Lucid Gravity. The company's signature seven-slot grille is LED-lit, while the rear end will likely feature a solid LED light bar, if the brief glimpses shown in the teaser video are anything to go on. In fact, the car seems to look near identical to the concept Jeep showed back in 2022:
The Wagoneer S is the first of two electric Jeep planned for 2024, with the smaller Recon also expected to enter production sometime this year. The two vehicles are the first steps in a plan to reshape Jeep's portfolio, joining the company's first electric vehicle, the Avenger, that launched in Europe in 2022.

This Ford F-150 Lightning One-Off Is Basically An Electric Raptor,https://www.motor1.com/news/704889/ford-f150-lightning-switchgear/,"It's called the Lightning Switchgear, and it loves to fly.",2024-12-25 09:05:38,"At a glance, one might mistake this burly Ford pickup truck for an F-150 Raptor. And why not? It’s got big mud tires (37 inchers to be exact) bolted to gnarly wheels. There's more ground clearance, more stance, more flash – everything you’d expect from Ford’s popular off-roader. But that face clearly belongs to the F-150 Lightning. Technically speaking, this isn't an electric Raptor. However, Ford tells us it's heavily influenced by years of Raptor experience.
Officially, it’s the F-150 Lightning Switchgear and no, you can’t buy it (yet). This rig is the latest demonstrator from Ford, joining vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E 1400 and bonkers SuperVan to showcase electric performance in various genres. While the Switchgear is aimed at conquering all things off-road, Ford is keen to mention this truck is also designed for performance on pavement. You might say it puts the switch in Switchgear.
For now, you want to know about the F-150 Lightning that gets airborne on purpose. To make that happen, Ford teamed up with RTR Vehicles and Vaughn Gittin Jr, and though it looks merely like a Raptorized EV, Ford tells us the Switchgear is its own entity. Fox 3.0 internal-bypass shocks are installed front and rear, paired with a custom double-wishbone suspension in front and multi-link independent with a stabilizer bar at the rear. The changes give the Switchgear a considerably wider track, 80 inches front and rear, and it wears custom carbon body panels with big ol' fender flares to contain the tires.
In off-road guise, these changes give the Switchgear 13.5 inches of ground clearance in front and 11.0 inches at the back. That's aided by the aforementioned 37-inch off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, and if you peek underneath, you'll see a steel skid plate and custom rock rails. Special front and rear bumpers help with approach and departure angles, too. The upgrades add approximately 150 pounds to the standard Lightning XLT, not bad considering all those changes but we're still talking about a truck that weighs around 7,000 pounds.
Here's where things get a bit interesting. The Switchgear also has an on-road configuration using pretty much the same suspension components. The 18-inch wheels and knobby tires are replaced with 20-inchers on street-friendly rubber. The skid plate, rock rails, and high-clearance bumpers are ditched for a big carbon composite front fascia, rocker panels, and a tonneau cover. The suspension is tweaked with different springs to favor a lower ride height, specifically 7.0 inches in front, 5.0 inches at the back.
In both formats, the powertrain is the same, and by that we mean it's 100-percent stock. That's a dual-motor setup with a 131.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack from the extended-range model. Output is 580 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque.
While Ford won't build a Lightning Switchgear for the public, Ford CEO Jim Farley says demonstrator vehicles like it play a key role in public perception of the brand. Speaking to the press at Multimatic's facility in North Carolina, he evoked the memory of Ken Block, stating the need for vehicles like these ""to generate digital content and just have fun.""
That said, despite the Switchgear's dual nature, Ford debuted only the off-road version of the upgraded Lightning at the big Ford Performance 2024 kickoff in Charlotte, North Carolina. For now at least, there's no denying the company's focus is on having fun in – and above – the dirt.
""We want to own off-road,"" said Farley. ""I don't care if it's Hammers, Dakar, or Baja.""
The hammers to which he is referring is King of the Hammers, a major off-road event held in Johnson Valley, California. Ford will be there with the Lightning Switchgear later this month, but for those more interested in the on-road version, automaker representatives tell us there's more to come.

The New Ford Kuga PHEV Has More Power Than The Escape,https://www.motor1.com/news/704903/2024-ford-kuga-facelift-specs/,Europe's Escape gets a mid-cycle update with a much quicker plug-in hybrid version.,2024-12-25 09:05:38,"If the new-ish Ford Kuga for Europe looks familiar, there's a good reason. The equivalent American version, the Escape, received its facelift near the end of 2022. It's only now that Ford is updating the compact crossover in Europe where there are some notable changes.
For the first time, the Kuga gets the rugged Active trim with extra plastic body cladding and silver skid plates. The adventurous flavor sits 0.4 inches higher at the front axle and 0.2 in at the rear for extra ground clearance. Ford also throws in a Trail drive mode that tweaks throttle response and traction control for more grip on mud, sand, and other soft surfaces.
Inside, the Kuga Active gets a dark wood trim on the dashboard and door panels, along with exclusive upholstery on the 18-way adjustable seats. It's worth noting the Escape has had the Active trim for years in the United States where it serves as the base model. In Europe, the 2024 Kuga will also be available in Titanium and ST-Line grades, each with subtle styling tweaks over the pre-facelifted versions.
As expected, the 2024 Kuga switches to Ford's SYNC 4 infotainment system with a 13.2-inch touchscreen accompanied by a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. The center console has been simplified by eliminating most of the conventional controls after integrating their respective functions into the enlarged display.
The engine lineup doesn't include a diesel anymore after falling out of favor in Europe, but the base version has a turbocharged 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine with 148 hp sent to the front axle via a six-speed manual gearbox. You can step up to a self-charging hybrid with a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor making a combined 177 hp in the FWD version and a slightly higher 180 hp in the AWD model.
The highlight is an upgraded plug-in hybrid, also with a 2.5-liter engine. It now puts out a combined 240 hp, which is 30 hp than the Escape PHEV. It also packs an extra 18 hp than the pre-facelift Kuga PHEV and uses ""an upgraded power-split automatic transmission"" shared with the Kuga Hybrid AWD.
The Kuga PHEV now hits 62 mph in 7.3 seconds, making it nearly two seconds quicker than before. In addition, the towing capacity has jumped by over 30 percent to 4,629 pounds. Thanks to a 14.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, it offers a maximum electric range of 43 miles (69 kilometers) in the WLTP cycle.
Ford is already taking orders in some European countries for the 2024 Kuga. A report published last year by Automotive News claimed the Escape will be retired from the US at some point in 2025.

That Futuristic Electric Kia Van Could Be Your Next Uber,https://insideevs.com/news/704869/kia-uber-deal-pbv-van/,Kia and Uber are teaming up to develop electric vehicles specifically built for ride-hailing.,2024-01-16 15:02:47,"Someday, you may have to say goodbye to rides to the airport in humdrum Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords. Kia’s futuristic electric vans have won over their first customer: Uber.
The two companies announced last week that they’ve signed a memorandum of understanding to use Kia’s upcoming “Platform Beyond Vehicle” (PBV) vans as ride-hailing vehicles. It’s a win-win; Uber aims to use exclusively zero-emission vehicles by 2040, and Kia needs buyers for the new family of commercial models coming in 2025.
Uber and Kia make an EV deal
Uber wants to transition its entire fleet to electric vehicles by 2040. A new line of Kia vans could help make that happen.
Kia announced the line of toaster-shaped PBV models at CES last week. The idea is to offer several different vehicle types—robotaxis, delivery vans, pickup trucks (potentially)—that all use a shared platform and driver compartment, simplifying manufacturing. The medium-sized PV5 will be Kia’s first offering, followed by larger and smaller variants.
Together, Kia and Uber will “identify optimal specifications for PBV models” and develop “PBVs tailored to the needs of drivers that use the Uber platform,” the companies said. The announcement was light on specifics about what that ride-hailing vehicle could look like but did mention “interactive rear seat entertainment systems” as a potential feature.
The PV5 concept that Kia trotted out at CES showcased another feature that could prove useful for Uber drivers and riders: a TV-sized screen embedded in its front bumper. Flashing a rider’s name or a specific code could take the guesswork out of hopping into the right car.
More Kia/Hyundai News
One potential hurdle here: Uber doesn’t provide vehicles for its drivers, who are independent contractors. That complicates its whole plan to clean up its fleet, which it's doing as regulations restricting the sale and use of gas-powered vehicles intensify around the globe. The companies say they’re working on ways to reduce the up-front cost of buying a PV5 and are exploring solutions like a battery subscription option. (An EV's battery is typically its most expensive single component.)
Down the line, Kia plans to introduce a sensor-covered PV5 that would serve as a robotaxi for Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group (Kia’s parent company) and Aptiv (an automotive supplier).

The Nissan Ariya Nismo Is A 430 Horsepower Japan-Only Sports Crossover,https://insideevs.com/news/704448/ariya-nismo-japan-salon/,Nissan has injected the ho-hum Ariya with go-fast goodies and handling upgrades.,2024-01-12 15:32:48,"It’s Toyko Auto Salon time. Akin to the U.S.’s SEMA show, the Tokyo Auto Salon acts as a great space for aftermarket and traditional OEMs to show off their hotted-up projects that are more racy than the standard fare. This year, Nissan has shown off a spicy Ariya—and it looks like it goes way beyond the standard fare of only visual enhancements.
The Nissan Ariya Nismo Has 430 Horsepower
The Nissan Ariya Nismo is the most powerful Ariya on tap and includes a bevy of performance upgrades to make it sharper to drive. It won't be sold outside of Japan, though.
To create the Ariya Nismo, Nissan started with a standard dual-motor AWD Ariya e-4ORCE, then threw a gaggle of visual and mechanical enhancements to make the car more engaging. The 20-inch aluminum wheels are “highly rigid”, and wrapped in special tires specific to this car. Nissan says that coupled with the unspecified chassis enhancements, turn-in on the Ariya NISMO is greatly improved. The Ariya Nismo's aggressive styling is also useful, too – the ground effects kit and rear spoiler contribute to reduced drag, but more downforce at higher speeds, something Nissan says also improves the Ariya’s cornering performance.
The Ariya Nismo’s credentials go beyond racy styling or handling upgrades. Nissan also reworked the car’s EV powertrain so it now its peak output is 10% higher. For Japan, the Ariya Nismo will come in two NISMO B6 e-4ORCE, and the NISMO B9 e-4ORCE. The B6 model comes with the smaller 66 kWh battery good 362 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. The B9 model gets the larger 91 kWh battery, and its two motors produce 430 hp and 443 pound-feet of torque. No official performance numbers have been released, but we’d expect the B9 to out-accelerate the roughly 5-second 0-60 time of the standard top-of-the-line Ariya. At the very least, it should be more entertaining to drive, Nissan has added a special NISMO mode that sharpens throttle response, while providing a formula-E-inspired engine soundtrack to make the car feel even more dynamic.
These all sound like great changes to make a not-very-interesting crossover, exciting. There’s one big problem though: Nissan has no plans to market it outside of Japan. Our sister site Motor 1 received a statement from Nissan: “This is a very exciting time in Nissan’s electrification journey in our region and we are constantly looking ahead to ensure we bring our customers the best products and experiences. For the time being, the car will only be available in the Japanese market. We have no further announcements at this stage regarding introduction of this car to other markets.”
That’s truly a bummer. The Ariya is an okay EV, but when it comes to driving excitement, it definitely does not deliver anything at all. That’s upsetting, considering that this Ariya could have the chops to go against legitimately sporty EV crossovers – last year a lowered Ariya prototype was spied driving around the Nürburgring. If that Nürburgring energy was successfully imparted to the Ariya NISMO, it could be a credible threat to EVs like the Tesla Model Y Performance, Ford Mustang Mach-E GT, Kia EV6 GT, or the forthcoming Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Truly a shame that Nissan won’t sell it outside of Japan.

The 2025 Dodge Charger Looks Just Like The Excellent Concept,https://insideevs.com/news/704431/2025-dodge-charger-pre-pro/,The electric future of Dodge muscle cars is shaping up quite nicely in these pre-production photos.,2024-01-12 10:45:33,"Here's a nice Friday surprise for any muscle car fans out there wondering if an electric future has anything in for them: the first pre-production photos of the car that's expected to be called the 2025 Dodge Charger have emerged. And it looks extremely close to the excellent Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Concept that's been making the rounds for a while.
These photos appeared on Dodge's Facebook page earlier this morning, and the downside is they come with no actual news, unfortunately. No further details about powertrain, price, performance or anything else we need to know as this Mopar icon makes the jump to electric power. But hey, we do know it's going to look awesome, and that's certainly something.
All we get from these photos of a car on a lot (presumably in Michigan) as camo tape is stripped away from it is a caption that says, ""No cameras or recording devices permitted. Pre-production model shown. Available late 2024."" The rest is up to your imagination, but since this is indeed a pre-production model—used for all sorts of things including testing—it does tell us that the design language of that concept car has translated to the real thing.
Unveiled in fall 2022, the Charger Daytona SRT Concept previewed an all-electric future for American muscle. That topic is as controversial as you get for enthusiasts who may not exactly be eager to part ways with internal combustion. But the specs may win them over: an 800-volt architecture, all-wheel-drive, speeds projected to surpass the SRT Hellcat and factory performance upgrades. It's believed the car will come with a variety of power outputs ranging from 455 horsepower to 800 hp or more.
The next Charger (which is a coupe, unlike the outgoing Charger sedan) is equally controversial for what's called the Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust system: an artificial sound that simulates the rumble and pitch of a V8 engine and is said to be as loud as a Hellcat as well. When that feature was previewed in 2022, it debuted to mixed reactions, to say the least. But the Mopar folks have indicated they've been working on it since, so the final product might be much more of a crowd-pleaser.
Interestingly, Dodge initially indicated the Charger would be EV-only, but now it's expected to pack a gas engine as well—possibly the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter ""Hurricane"" inline-six currently available in Ram and Jeep vehicles. It's unclear which one we're looking at in these new pics, but given the importance of this EV to the future of muscle cars, it possible Dodge will want to lead with that version. (And is that a gas cap or a charging port here?)
Either way, I think it looks sharp. We'll see if it has what it takes to win over the V8 die-hards when it makes its official debut later this year.

Hyundai Makes The Ioniq 5 N Meaner With N Performance Parts,https://www.motor1.com/news/704336/hyundai-lexus-2024-tokyo-auto-salon/,"Plus, Lexus does the same with a special-edition RZ that has two rear wings.",2024-12-25 09:05:41,"Hyundai and Lexus have given their electric SUVs more aggressive body kits for this week's 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon in Japan.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Hyundai NPX1 Concept
Forget about BMW's M Performance Parts; Hyundai would like to introduce you to its N Performance Parts. These additional enhancements are showcased on an Ioniq 5 N, dubbed the NPX1, at the Tokyo Auto Salon. While extra bits have been available for N gasoline models for a while, this marks the first time an electric N is getting them.
Although the NPX1 is technically a concept, Hyundai plans to start selling the parts for the Ioniq 5 N later this year. The showcar from TAS looks mean with its comprehensive body kit, featuring a carbon front splitter and a massive rear wing. It also has beefier side skirts and an enlarged diffuser, while the wheels are built from a combination of alloy and carbon to reduce weight
Suspension lowering springs and upgraded brake pads round off the changes on the outside. Although images of the interior have yet to be revealed, Hyundai mentions that the NPX1 sports bucket seats and makes generous use of Alcantara.
Going forward, the South Korean automaker intends to develop N Performance Parts for all its N cars.
Lexus RZ 450e F Sport Performance
Lexus has a similar idea for its electric SUV, as the RZ has also received a collection of performance parts. Unlike the NPX1 concept, this is going into production as is. The special edition is limited to 100 units, based on the RZ450e. Just like the Subaru WRX S4 STI Sport showcased at TAS, it will be sold through a lottery system. Japanese customers can enter from now until February 19, with the lucky winners set to be announced on February 22.
The first dedicated electric vehicle from Lexus has gained an aggressive body kit with not one but two rear wings. It incorporates a total of 17 aerodynamic body parts and a sportier suspension kit complemented by 21-inch wheels. The RZ450e F Sport Performance is slightly longer, wider, and taller than the standard model. The flashy SUV is painted in matte white and features a predominantly black cabin with blue accents and suede upholstery.
You're not getting any extra power since it has the same dual-motor setup with a front-mounted motor making 201 hp and 195 lb-ft (265 Nm) along with a rear motor rated at 107 hp and 130 lb-ft (170 Nm).
Taking after the 2023 RZ Sport Concept, the special edition costs 11,800,000 yen ($81,300).

"Biden Announces $623 Million In Funding For 7,500 Charging Plugs",https://insideevs.com/news/704272/biden-charging-plugs-funding/,More charging plugs are badly needed for Biden's plan to accelerate adoption of electric vehicles.,2024-01-11 15:55:44,"Even with a big infusion of federal money in recent years, charging your electric car in public still isn't the easiest thing to do. The Biden Administration has taken some heat for this situation as of late, but today, it announced some welcome news for EV drivers everywhere: an additional $623 million in grants aimed at putting 7,500 more EV charging ports in the ground across 22 states and Puerto Rico.
The funding comes by way of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program, which arms the Federal Highway Administration with $2.5 billion to spend on alternative fueling stations, including EV chargers, in local communities and along highways. The grants announced on Thursday were the first awarded through the initiative.
Biden's big EV charging plan
President Biden has made it a central mission to combat climate change and get more Americans buying electric cars. Congress has allotted $7.5 billion to build out the country's charging infrastructure.
“This funding will help ensure that EV chargers are accessible, reliable, and convenient for American drivers, while creating jobs in charger manufacturing, installation, and maintenance for American workers,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.
The FHA will dole out $311 million to 36 so-called “community” projects building EV charging and hydrogen fueling stations at schools, libraries, public parks and the like. The other $312 million will go toward “corridor” projects along major highways.
President Joe Biden has made transitioning U.S. drivers away from gas-guzzlers one of his central policy missions, touting a goal to make half of the country’s car sales electric by 2030. More charging infrastructure—along with more robust and reliable stations—is badly needed to make that happen.
Importantly, the CFI program invests in slower Level 2 charging plugs in local communities, complementing the national network of Level 3 fast chargers that the White House is funding along interstate highways. (While it tends to be less of a priority than fast charging, there remains a strong need for overnight public charging as well.)
More Charging Stories
The U.S. government’s $7.5 billion program to blanket the country with 500,000 extra charging stations is only just starting to bear fruit. The first Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-funded charging location came online in December, just over two years after Congress approved the funding. That progress comes on the brink of a presidential election and during a time when electric cars are more politicized than ever.
Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates—including former President Donald Trump—have ramped up their attacks on EVs, bashing them as impractical, expensive cars that Democrats are forcing on the American public. The more progress the White House can make on charging in 2024, the better things will be—both for EV buyers and for Biden's reelection chances.

The Tesla Model 3 'Highland' Facelift Is Finally Coming To North America,https://insideevs.com/news/703915/tesla-model-3-facelift-us-debut/,Deliveries in the United States are estimated to begin this month.,2024-01-10 02:40:31,"The refreshed Tesla Model 3, also known as Highland after its internal development code, can now be ordered in North America, five months after it debuted in Europe and other parts of the world.
As with its European counterpart, the American-bound Model 3 is available with only two powertrain options: the base Rear-Wheel Drive, which starts at $38,990 and offers an EPA-estimated driving range of 272 miles, and the Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive Long Range, which has an MSRP of $45,990 and ups the range figure to 341 miles.
The updated Tesla Model 3 makes its way to the U.S.
Five months after its European launch, the refreshed Tesla Model 3 is now available in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The pricing is the same as before, but there’s no Performance trim and the car is not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit in the U.S.
There’s no Performance trim yet in the online configurator, but a Sport or Ludicrous version might come at a later date, as discovered in the official Tesla parts catalog and the software code for the car itself.
Compared to the pre-facelift version, the new Model 3 offers the same number of driving miles on a full charge, while the Long Range version comes with 8 more miles of advertised range. The prices are the same as for the outgoing model.
Leasing is also available starting at the same price of $329/month as before, but there’s no word on whether the facelifted Model 3 is eligible for the $7,500 tax credit when buying outright. Before the updated model became available Stateside, the Model 3 Performance was the only version eligible for the tax credit.
More Model 3 Stories
Tesla is now taking orders for the refreshed EV through its website, with deliveries estimated to begin in January-February.
Few if any surprises are in store for U.S. buyers, as the car was revealed back in August of last year. The updated Model 3 comes with a redesigned face that no longer features standalone fog lights and indicators, as they have been integrated into the main headlight units). It also has new rear lights that are now single-piece rather than the split type that was fitted to the old version.
Inside, there are LED ambient light strips and a newly added 8-inch rear display with controls for climate, ventilation, and infotainment, while the front 15.4-inch display is the same size as before but has slimmer bezels.
The column-mounted stalks are gone, with buttons on the steering wheel taking over the functions of the levers. Furthermore, comfort was increased thanks to the use of acoustic glass for the entire glasshouse and more sound-deadening material, and the ride is a bit better than before thanks to a revised front suspension geometry. Ventilated front seats are also offered as standard.
The facelifted Tesla Model 3 is also available in Canada and Mexico with the same features and estimated delivery window.",Iulian Dnistran
"Honda's First Next-Generation EV Will Look ""Very Close"" To Concept, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/703890/honda-saloon-concept-ev-very-close/,Honda revealed two futuristic concept cars on Tuesday that preview its next-generation global EV lineup.,2024-01-09 18:35:01,"When car companies show off outlandish concept cars, it’s often tough to distinguish fact from fiction—to parse out what’s purely a design exercise versus what’s actually headed to production.
Those questions were top of mind as Honda pulled the wraps off of two futuristic electric concepts on Tuesday at CES in Las Vegas. At a press conference, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe cleared up some of the confusion.
“A production model, based very close on this concept, will come first to the US and then around the world in 2026,” he said, referring to a long, sleek concept called the Saloon.
It’s likely that many of the Saloon’s quirkiest attributes—like a dazzling screen in place of a grille and enormous gull-wing doors—won’t make it to American roads. But Mibe’s comments suggest that the overall design and look of the Saloon, which is unlike any vehicle on the road, will in fact be carried through to production.
Visually, the Saloon is simple and striking. It's comprised of a single form, rather than the traditional three-box design (hood, greenhouse, trunk) that sedans traditionally follow. It evokes wedge-shaped cars of the 1970s and 1980s—like the Lamborghini Countach—more than anything from the 21st century. Its low roofline and slippery silhouette will help reduce drag and increase range, a primary concern for EVs, Honda said. It also features a new Honda logo.
More CES 2024 News
Honda also unveiled a concept van called the Space Hub, but it hasn't indicated that a production vehicle like it will hit the market.
The Saloon-inspired car will launch Honda’s new family of electric vehicles, dubbed Honda 0. They debut new tech from Honda that will allow for faster charging and better efficiency than today’s EVs. Specifics on the new line of vehicles are scant. We hope to learn more as 2026 approaches.

Honda EVs Will Sport A Brand New Logo,https://insideevs.com/news/703866/honda-new-logo-ces/,Next-gen electric versions of Honda's passenger cars are getting a new logo for the first time in 22 years.,2024-01-09 14:04:06,"Next-gen electric versions of Honda's passenger cars are getting a new logo for the first time in 22 years.
At CES today, Honda announced two new EV concepts, the Saloon and Space-Hub, as well as a new global EV platform called ""Honda 0."" Only the Salon is going into production—well, kind of, anyway. The Saloon will serve as the basis for Honda's EVs coming in 2026. That's not to say that the radical design cues will come to a driveway near you (although the Cybertruck is real, so here's hoping), but maybe its spacious interior, high-tech steer-by-wire, and other small tidbits.
Honda's electrification strategy is the company's biggest transformation in decades.
Honda's new ""H mark"" logo represents not just the brand's drastic change by electrifying its fleet, but also its shift from the typical ""thick, heavy, but smart"" mentality for EVs to one that makes its cars ""thin, light, and wise.""
One design that we know will be coming is a new Honda ""H mark"" logo that sits square in the center of its grille.
Honda says that its new ""H mark"" logo will be used exclusively for its next generation EVs. The idea is to visually demonstrate that Honda is taking on a a historic transformation as the world pivots to EVs. The logo is said to represent ""two outstretched hands,"" which Honda says represents its commitment to expand the possibilities of mobility.
Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda, says that the automaker plans on doing things a bit differently. Rather than build land yachts, Honda is committing to building lean and efficient battery-powered driving machines. And that alone is a huge deal. Here's what CEO Mibe has to say about the brand's path forward:
The mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of ""thick, heavy, but smart"" EVs. We will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.
Now that we've got the marketing talk out of the way, let's get into the meat of this. This is a pretty big branding change for Honda. It has held the current H mark for more than two decades now, and it's had some sort of surround to its older vehicle emblems for the better part of a half-century. This departure certainly is different, and—let's be real—is probably better than Kia's recent rebranding that has people asking ""what is the KN car brand?""
Obviously, Honda's going to need more than a logo change to prove it's a serious player in the EV space. It only sells a few electric models globally and will depend on General Motors' Ultium platform for its first modern EV efforts in North America, the upcoming Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX. Things may be changing quickly, however. Honda is now planning a major battery hub in Ohio and may also be doing a huge EV factory in Canada. Perhaps this logo change signals a shift many fans have been waiting for.
Tell us: what do you think of Honda's new design shift?

"The Tiny, Ultra Cheap VinFast VF3 EV Is Coming To The U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/703867/ultra-cheap-vinfast-vf3-confirmed-us/,The Vietnamese automaker also showcased a mid-size pickup concept that will supposedly become a series production model.,2024-01-09 14:00:00,"The pint-sized VinFast VF3 all-electric urban runabout is officially coming to the United States, a company spokesperson confirmed for InsideEVs during the model’s global launch at CES 2024 in Las Vegas earlier today. The Wild mid-size pickup concept, which previews a series production model, was also revealed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show.
It’s good news for anybody who’s looking for a no-frills, affordable all-electric vehicle that offers the bare necessities and just enough space inside for four people. That said, we still don’t know when exactly the diminutive EV will reach American shores or how much it will cost when it eventually arrives in dealerships here, but an adviser to the automaker went on record last year saying that “it’s probably sub-$20,000.”
VinFast confirms tiny two-door EV will come to the U.S.
VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker that's trying to make a name for itself in the American car market, confirmed that its smallest and most affordable model, the VF3, will come to the United States.
If it turns out to be true, it would be the cheapest new EV on sale in the country that’s not a Neighbourhood Electric Vehicle (NEV), meaning that getting a battery-powered car would be easier for many more people who can’t afford anything more expensive.
More VinFast Stories
Measuring just 125.6 inches long, 66.1 in wide, and 63.8 in tall, the VF3 is about 30 inches shorter, 3 inches narrower, and 1 inch taller than the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Details are still scarce, but VinFast said it’s aiming for an EPA driving range of 125 miles on a full charge.
Is that enough for American streets? We’ll have to wait and see when the car becomes a real occurrence on U.S. roads and not just a placeholder. In the meantime, you can scroll down to the comments section to let us know what you think.
There’s a 10-inch screen for the infotainment system, as well as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, although the company didn’t mention if they’re of the wired or wireless variety.
The two rear seats fold flat to create a total cargo capacity of 550 liters or 19.42 cubic feet, which is on par with a compact four-door hatchback. It’s worth noting, however, that VinFast didn’t say what the cargo capacity of the VF3 is with all four seats in place, but we’d argue it’s tiny.
Then, there are the unavoidable potential issues of reliability and build quality. One of the marque’s bigger EVs, the VF8, which is already being sold in the U.S., was slammed by several reviewers when it was launched Stateside. The InsideEVs review of the 2023 VinFast VF8 City Edition summed everything up into one word in the headline: “Yikes.”
The Vietnamese startup will begin accepting reservations for the VF3 sometime this year. In its home market of Vietnam, deliveries of the pint-sized EV are scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year, and we expect the U.S. to follow.
Stepping into the fantasy world for a moment (even if we were just barely outside of it), VinFast also revealed a concept vehicle that portrays an all-electric pickup truck. Dubbed the Wild, the EV is 209 in long and 79 in wide and features a power-folding mid-gate that allows the bed length to expand from 5 to 8 feet with the rear seats folded down automatically.
There’s also a panoramic glass roof and a pair of digital side mirrors that supposedly improve aerodynamics, but probably the most important piece of information is that the Wild pickup previews a series-production electric pickup that may or may not come to the United States.
If it does make its way to the U.S., it would go against other pickups like the Tesla Cybertruck, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Rivian R1T, but it’s worth mentioning that all of these are real vehicles you can buy and that all three are longer than VinFast’s concept (the R1T is classed as mid-size while the Lightning and Cybertruck are full-size).
They also benefit from established and growing service networks, as opposed to VinFast, which is still in its infancy on all fronts.",Iulian Dnistran
Honda Previews New Line Of EVs With Two Futuristic Concept Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/703699/honda-concept-evs-new-platform/,"A production vehicle based on the sleek Saloon concept should hit the North American market in 2026, Honda says.",2024-01-09 14:00:00,"Lacking a single electric model on sale in the U.S., Honda hasn’t embraced electrification quite as enthusiastically as some rivals. But that’s changing.
On Tuesday at CES in Las Vegas, the Japanese automaker took the wraps off of two futuristic concept cars that preview a new lineup of EVs dubbed Honda 0. Honda has bold plans to launch 30 new electric models globally by 2030 and transition to exclusively zero-emission sales in the US by 2040. Tuesday’s announcement gives us a better sense of what that transformation will look like in practice. So let’s dive in.
The more significant concept car here is the Saloon, which will serve as the basis of the first Honda 0 production car come 2026. It will launch in 2026 in North America before hitting other markets. Honda says the long, sleek concept sits on a dedicated EV platform and has a “surprisingly spacious” interior made from sustainable materials. With a silhouette vaguely reminiscent of wedge-era cars like the Delorean DMC-12, it would be an EV that looks unlike anything else on the road today.
It’s likely that the production car's design will be significantly more restrained. (But here’s hoping that come 2026 you’ll be able to buy a Honda that looks just like this.)
Other features found in the Saloon that could make it into a future production vehicle: an airplane-style steering yoke and a steer-by-wire system. The latter means the steering wheel tells the wheels to turn electronically, not mechanically like usual. That type of setup could allow for some interesting capabilities. Turning the steering yoke the same amount could result in different turning behavior in a tight parking lot versus on the highway, for example.
Details are much more scant on the Space Hub concept, a rounded, van-looking thing with a big interior and two rows of seating that face one another. There’s no word yet on whether it’ll inspire a production vehicle, but you can bet that Honda will introduce an SUV to the Honda 0 portfolio sooner rather than later. That’s just what Americans crave.
Both concepts showcase a new design and engineering approach Honda’s using for the Honda 0 lineup.
Until then, the company’s first EVs for the US—the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX SUVs, hitting roads this year—will borrow their underlying technology from General Motors. (And, I’ll add, the Ultium technology underpinning GM's latest EVs has hit a few stumbling blocks during its prolonged development. Software glitches in a Chevrolet Blazer EV recently stranded our very own Kevin Williams.)
These next-generation vehicles will use EV technology that Honda is developing completely in-house. Until then, concrete details remain fairly scant. The range of these vehicles is anyone’s guess; Honda says it will be “ample.”
The company is prioritizing lightweight packaging, efficiency and new software features. Honda 0 vehicles will be powered by energy-dense batteries that can recharge from 15% to 80% in 10-15 minutes, faster than most vehicles today, the company said. Those batteries will degrade by less than 10% over 10 years.
The vehicles will come equipped with a Honda-developed operating system that uses AI to learn a driver’s needs and preferences over time. And they’ll offer a next-generation automated-driving system that will allow for hands-free driving on surface streets, according to Honda. Oh, and in another sign that Honda means business here, it's introducing a new ""H"" logo to slap on these bad boys.
We’ll have to wait and see how this all pans out come 2026 and beyond. In the meantime, we’re on site at CES and hope to hear more. Feel free to drop any burning questions for Honda executives, designers and engineers down below.

"AI Assistants, In-Car Gaming And Tons Of Range: Coming To Your Next Mercedes-Benz",https://insideevs.com/news/703668/mercedes-official-ces-2024/,"Mercedes has some bold, experimental ideas for how your driving experience could feel in the next few years. Will customers bite?",2024-01-08 21:00:00,"The fight for automotive supremacy in the future won't come down to horsepower or mechanical specs. It will probably come down to software; at least, that's what the car companies tell us. That idea may seem radical to anyone driving a car from the last decade who's just happy that their Apple CarPlay or Android Auto setup works so well, but all of the automakers have much bigger, grander plans for what we experience inside their cars than we currently do.
Case in point: Mercedes-Benz's big announcements at CES 2024 aren't about performance or even electric range this time, but the future software-driven features coming to its cars very soon.
The giant Las Vegas tech show served as a preview for a bevy of Mercedes technologies coming to both its EVs and internal combustion-powered cars starting next year, including its smartest voice-controlled virtual assistant ever thanks to AI; more expansions into in-car gaming; a taste of its new all-encompassing suite, MB.OS; the North American debut of its future electric sedan and Tesla Model 3 competitor; and a unique system co-developed with musician will.i.am that ""allows music to react to how the car is being driven,"" in Mercedes' words. (More on that in its own story right here.) Let's dive in.
In-car software and AI is the big story at CES this year
After years of EV and concept car debuts, automakers like Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW are focused on upping their software game at the tech mega-show in 2024. All car companies have huge plans for revenue through software features, including via subscriptions.
If you've been fortunate enough to experience Mercedes' MBUX software system across all three parts of the Hyperscreen on certain EQ electric cars, you know how powerful and graphically impressive it is. (At least, that's my take.) Equally impressive are the voice controls, where you can say ""Hey, Mercedes"" and get a swift response to most things you need without having to fish through the Hyperscreen's menus when you're on the road.
To that, Mercedes says: ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" The MB.OS system coming soon to the company's all-new MMA platform is a purpose-built chip-to-cloud operating system that brings a number of diverse functions under one roof: in-car content, charging, maps, car setting controls and automated driving.
A big part of that will be the MBUX Virtual Assistant, which Mercedes calls "" the most human-like interface with a Mercedes-Benz yet."" Powered by ChatGPT—something Volkswagen announced today at CES as well—Mercedes' Chief Technology Officer Markus Schäfer said the system can do more than just follow your voice commands. It can have a ""dialogue"" with users, and even pick up on the moods they're in to respond with ""empathy.""
The AI has four different personality traits—Natural, Predictive, Personal and Empathetic—that can be adjusted to your personal tastes or situation behind the wheel. The AI Projects as a glowing three-pointed star logo with various color changes and animations to illustrate its state of being. It could glow a certain way when providing a warning, for example, and a different way when it's listening to you.
""In some cases, hopefully, the assistant predicts already what you want, depending on your moods, the daytime, the location you are in and the circumstances you are in,"" Schäfer said. But after an easy conversation, Schäfer said the assistant ""can address whatever you want from your car, whether you want entertainment, you want information and so on.""
The assistant has four different ""emotions"" and can respond to your requests based on your own mood at the time. ""You can have a constant interaction with your car,"" Schäfer told InsideEVs at a press roundtable earlier today.
In other words, this system should do a lot more than just tell you where the nearest charging station is when you say ""Hey, Mercedes."" It may also commiserate with you about how annoyed you are to be stuck in traffic.
These days, it's not uncommon for high-tech EVs to have displays with visualizations of the cars and objects in the surrounding area; Tesla's center screen is arguably the best example of this. But Mercedes is taking this to a different level.
Using the Unity game engine, the next-gen cars will offer MBUX Surround Navigation: a 3D visualization that allows you to ""see what the car sees,"" as Mercedes puts it. Though your eyes are good at what they do, this system gives more of a bird's-eye view of other cars, trucks, cyclists or even pedestrians—superimposing potential hazards onto the route guidance to help you navigate a tough urban environment beyond just what you yourself can see.
""So for example, navigating through downtown traffic, finding a parking spot, knowing where you're going to make your turn""—all are projected via Surround Navigation, Mercedes' Chief Software Officer Magnus Östberg said during the press conference. The 3D game engine projects ""all the sensor data that we're taking from the cameras, the radar, the LIDAR, that really gives the driver situational awareness. It's not only beautiful graphics but also a safe experience,"" he said.
Though we weren't offered the chance to experience this for ourselves at CES, it does seem like an impressive evolution of the navigation experience—and a good visualization of much of the data the car normally keeps to itself.
Mercedes also knows you need something to do while you're charging, and at least one answer to that is the video games I had when I was a kid. Bubble Bobble is back, kids. Get excited.
Mercedes announced a wide array of partnerships bringing new music, movies, video games and other content to those giant screens soon. Those include Audible and Amazon Music for podcasts and audiobooks, as well as Antstream Arcade for retro cloud-based gaming. It's not far off what you can already do with your smartphone, but the native access to these services should provide a nice experience on some much bigger, more high-res screens when you have downtime in the car.
Though some early iterations of these features are available on the new 2024 Mercedes E-Class, which runs a ""precursor"" to MB.OS, the real show starts when the car above hits the road next year. That's the Concept CLA Class, which first debuted at IAA Munich in 2023 and is making its first-ever appearance in North America for CES.
The final production version of the next CLA isn't expected to veer too far from the concept here, and when it does, it will not only be a Model 3 fighter—something badly needed in an SUV-focused world—but it will debut MB.OS for the first time. That car will also be the first of at least four EVs on the new MMA platform, which, together with MB.OS, represents a much more cohesive transformation of Mercedes than we've seen before. By putting all these technologies together with one software platform, the automaker says it can offer a level of features and personalization it's never been able to before.
And the next CLA is expected to be a mighty EV, not just a computer on wheels. With an 800-volt architecture, an estimated 466 miles of range on Europe's WLTP cycle and the ability to add an estimated 248 miles of range in 15 minutes, this should be a winner if it even come close to those claims. Furthermore, with an estimated 5.2 miles per kilowatt-hour, it should be one of the most efficient EVs on the road.
We'll see this and more from Mercedes as CES goes on this week.

Kia’s 'Platform Beyond Vehicle' Is A Line Of Transforming Commercial EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/703518/kia-platform-beyond-vehicle/,"With extensive modularity, advanced software control and even a robotaxi eventually, Kia has wild plans for the utility vehicle space.",2024-01-08 18:00:00,"Car companies love to talk about “mobility solutions” and “last-mile delivery systems,” but with a few notable exceptions, the commercial vehicle space feels like a pretty stagnant one. Even if they happen to be electric, most efforts in that arena are just delivery vans or maybe pickup truck. Where’s the innovation? Well, Kia—the Korean automaker that’s rapidly becoming a major power player in the EV space—unveiled some future commercial vehicle plans at CES today, and they do seem to be on a different level.
Meet the Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV for short. It’s not just one car, but an entire platform of transforming, modular electric vehicles designed to underpin a family of future work-focused vehicles. The cars unveiled at CES are the PV1 small van, PV7 large van, and the midsize PV5, which actually comes in several variants that will also ultimately include an autonomous robotaxi.
Kia's got big, global plans
Though it used to be an ultra-budget brand, Kia is one of the fastest-growing automakers now in multiple countries and segments. Along with its corporate sibling Hyundai, it's got big plans for more EVs and EV factories globally—and now the commercial and delivery world, too.
In a news release, Kia's president and CEO Ho Sung Song said the PBV line ""represents our vision of going beyond the traditional concept of automobiles by fulfilling the unmet needs of diverse customers and communities through optimized vehicles and services catering to specific market and business circumstances.""
In other words, what you're seeing here is something different from the average electric crossover that seems to debut every week as of late. Moreover, this appears to be an entirely new line of business for Kia beyond just selling cars. These vehicles are ""intended to be a total mobility solution that combines fit-for-purpose EVs with advanced software solutions based on the Hyundai Motor Group’s software-to-everything, or SDx, strategy,"" the automaker said in a news release—meaning that fleet management via software will be a big part of what's to come here.
A few key details have not been released yet, however, including the cost of these vehicles, what battery packs they'll use and their estimated ranges. But this news offers a fascinating preview into what Kia has in store next.
We'll start with the PV5 family, which for now is just being called the Concept PV5 even though it looks fairly production-ready. You still get Kia's futuristic design language here, although it's pared down a bit for commercial use and kind of stands on its own. Four variants of PV5 debuted at CES—Basic, Van, High Roof, and Chassis Cab—each with large, pillarless door openings and a great deal of interior room.
Here's where things get really interesting. Kia says that the body parts behind the driver are modular and transformable, such that a single chassis can be used in multiple forms if the owner desires. Behind the cab, or ""driver zone,"" sit the ""life modules""—basically, the different van bodies. Those ""can be connected to the base vehicle via a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology, turning the PBV into a taxi during the day, to a delivery van at night, and a personal recreational vehicle on weekends,"" Kia said.
The idea of a modular car has been around for many decades—the old Nissan Pulsar Sportbak delivered on this back in the 1980s—but it's an idea that's generally stayed in the concept realm. Presumably, using a battery pack and electric motors in the floor might allow this idea to become more of a reality, since that setup eliminates a lot of the drivetrain challenges you'd encounter with a modular internal combustion car.
Kia adds that the body structure of these vans is weldless, too, enabling moveable members to adjust to the different vehicle sizes at work here. We're eager to learn more about how Kia's doing that and the manufacturing techniques involved. "" Shipped in standardized, convenient kit form, Dynamic Hybrid technology is intended to allow for the quick and simple in-field transformation of a Kia PV5,"" the automaker said.
More importantly, the PV5 is how Kia plans to introduce a dedicated robotaxi down the line. That van body style makes a lot more sense for such duty than, say, a Jaguar I-Pace. Kia added few details about that model, except to say that it aims for Level 4 autonomy—a high degree of full automated driving.
It's crucial to note that the robotaxi industry has had a rough go the past few years. Last year saw a number of crushing setbacks for General Motors subsidiary Cruise, and a year before that, the whole business was stunned at the closure of Argo AI. But even if that industry is contracting, many automakers and tech companies alike seem dead-set on the business potential of eventual full autonomy.
Kia added that it's working with companies like Boston Dynamics, Uber, the Dubai Taxi Corporation and its own Motional joint venture for a ""PBV-dedicated business system"" around these robotaxis.
Next, we have the two vans that that make up the smallest and biggest ends of the lineup. The PV7 is expected to be a large van with ""impressive range"" for long-distance hauling, while the PV1 is meant for short-distance transportation and has a turning radius designed for tight spaces.
There are several other key announcements here too. There's a huge software focus with the PBV line that includes fleet management, over-the-air updates, AI technologies for custom business solutions and more. ""Features may include inventory monitoring, temperature control, and intelligent route planning for efficiency. The solution is intended to streamline fleet management with real-time data and AI integration for predictive maintenance and optimal operational efficiency,"" the automaker said.
Moreover, Kia is building a dedicated plant in Korea for the PBV family of vehicles—complete with customization for different commercial clients—that is expected to go online in 2025 and will have an annual capacity of 150,000 units.
All in all, this announcement represents a big expansion of what Kia does, how it does it and who it serves; it almost sounds like the Korean company's cross between Google's Waymo and Rivian's commercial van business, on perhaps an even larger scale. And it's another example of how car companies find themselves facing a future where they need to do more than just sell cars to survive.
More on all of this as we sit down with Kia's executives at CES this week.

Volkswagen Says An Electric GTI Is Coming In 2026,https://www.motor1.com/news/701860/vw-design-boss-electric-gti-2026/,"Plus, Abarth launches a hot hatch with a retractable folding roof and Lexus-like vertically stacked exhaust tips.",2024-12-25 09:05:58,"An electric GTI is coming in two years' time, and Abarth launches an interesting version of the 595 pocket rocket.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Electric Volkswagen GTI Coming In 2026
While we're patiently waiting for the GTI to get a mid-cycle facelift in 2024, Volkswagen is already thinking ahead. The company's design boss took to Instagram to announce a fully electric version is coming in 2026. Andreas Mindt shared a sketch of the original Golf GTI alongside the recently unveiled ID. GTI concept.
Since the Mk1 came out in 1975, VW has managed to sell more than 2.8 million units of the Grand Tourer Injection out of a total of more than 35 million Golfs sold throughout eight generations. The first one without a combustion engine is arriving in roughly two years' time. It should peacefully coexist with the gasoline hot hatch for several years.
The sketch seemingly suggests that VW will use the ""Golf"" moniker for a production version of the ID. GTI. However, lest we forget the concept was based on another showcar, the ID. 2all. That was a smaller vehicle seen as future electric replacement of the Polo supermini. The peeps from Wolfsburg said it would be ""as spacious as a Golf, as affordable as a Polo."" Both concepts were underpinned by the forthcoming MEB Entry platform for front-wheel-drive vehicles. The ninth-generation, electric-only Golf due in 2028 will ride on the upcoming SSP platform.
Time will tell whether the electric GTI due in 2026 will be a Golf GTI or an ID.2 GTI since it's all a bit confusing right now. We wager it'll be the latter. In the meantime, VW has trademarked a new ""GTI"" logo where the ""I"" is replaced by a lightning bolt.
The Abarth F595C Has A Lexus-Like Exhaust
Abarth introduced the 500e electric hot hatch about a year ago but it’s still selling the gasoline versions in some parts of the world. Japan happens to be one of the markets where Fiat’s performance division is keeping the ICE alive. Not only that, but the feisty city car is getting the special edition treatment based on the convertible with its electrically folding fabric roof.
Available in both left- and right-hand-drive configurations, the Abarth F595C is capped at 160 units. Production is evenly split between LHD and RHD, both of which come with a five-speed manual gearbox. The special variant also gets a Beats audio system inherited from the beefier 695 series. Customers can pick from Grigio Record (gray) and Rosso Passione (red) colors, each capped at 80 units.
Power is provided by a turbocharged 1.4-liter gasoline engine making 162 hp and 154 lb-ft (210 Nm) of torque. That might not sound like much, but the car only weighs 2,557 pounds (1,160 kilograms). It's just about as heavy as a Mazda MX-5 Miata RF. It features vertically stacked exhaust tips that might make you think of a Lexus F model. BMW has an optional M Performance exhaust with stacked exhaust tips as well but they're mounted near the center. Mind you, this is not the first Abarth to adopt this setup since the F595 had it first back in 2021.
The Abarth F595C goes on sale today in Japan and costs 4,750,000 yen, which works out to about $33,200 at current exchange rates.

This Electric Porsche 964 RSR Misses The Point,https://www.motor1.com/news/701356/everatti-porsche-964-rsr/,"It looks cool, but those looks are passing checks the powertrain can't cash.",2024-12-25 09:06:00,"There's no shortage of Porsche 911 restomods these days. There's a version for every taste, whether you want something perfected by Singer, something a bit more wild by Guntherwerks, or something that revs to 11,000 by Tuthill. Then there's Everrati, the British company that's done some pretty clever work in converting 911s to full electric cars. Their latest, a tribute to the 3.8 liter 964 RS, though, is a bit of a conundrum.
Before we get into why, perhaps a bit of an explanation of what Everrati does is warranted. The company rips out the heart of the 911, the flat-six, and replaces it with two electric motors behind the rear axle. It then loads the car up with batteries, but in order to maintain weight distribution it splits the batteries between the front and rear. They're proud of being able to keep that the same to hopefully continue to give the 911 the same unique character its had since it debuted 60 years ago.
By all accounts, they are fun to drive and cost little to run, a zero-emission way to continue having a car that looks like an old 911 in a future when the combustion engine isn't dead. This particular model, though, is where things start to make less sense.
This flash of yellow is inspired by the 3.8 liter 964 RSR, one of the most raw 911s of that era, a true motorsport-inspired car with a widebody, big wing, and 325 hp that ran through a five-speed manual. Think of it like a race car for the road. They fetch big bucks now, too, with one selling in 2022 for $1.2 million.
Now, Everrati's version is likely better built than the original. It's better for the environment, too. It even gets to 60 in 3.7 seconds, about a second quicker than the original. I find it very hard to care.
The thing with a car like the RSR now is that it doesn't matter how well it's built, how good it is for the environment, or how quick it is. What matters is what it represents, a throwback to a time when cars were all about deep mechanical involvement. It's the thing that resonated with me after driving the new 911 S/T, and how every little bit of the mechanical experience connected with the driver. The RSR was an equally raw experience 30 years ago, a car that demanded your attention at all times and had an engine that spoke to every sense. Take away the engine and replace it with batteries and motors, and while the 911 S/T would probably still be great to drive, it'd no longer be the 911 S/T. It'd be a fun EV sports car.
More 911s? More 911s.
Here, we have a body kit on an old 911 and its heart ripped out, gearbox and all. The engagement that came from the drivetrain is dead, and you're left with a car that looks like the coolest 911 on the block and might even be fun to drive, but you're missing one of the most important elements of the original.
That's not to say EV conversions are bad things. On the contrary, for certain cars they make all the sense in the world. There are luxury cars from decades ago that would be better powered by electricity and some small sports cars could harness an EV powertrain in an interesting way. EV swaps have also certainly saved older cars that had blown engines and given them a second chance at life.
And while the base for this car may have given a scrap 964 a chance to live again, it's also gotten the body of a true legend, a car famous for how raw and uncompromising it is. Except its lost the component that not only gives it part of its name, but much of its character. I tend to judge owners who put badges on their cars that they don't deserve – here's looking at you guy with a 528i that says M5 on the back – and this 964 Carrera RS without an engine sure is one of them.
If you think I'm full of crap and that you want to buy one, be my guest. But if you buy an EV converted 911 with an RSR bodykit, prepare to do a lot of explaining, and be prepared to not sound cool at all while you do it.",Travis Okulski
The Toyota Crown Sport Goes Plug-In Hybrid With 302 Horsepower,https://www.motor1.com/news/701393/toyota-crown-sport-phev-details/,It can cover 56 miles without sipping any gasoline.,2024-12-25 09:06:02,"We only get two of the four Crown models here in the United States – the raised sedan and the upcoming Signia SUV. In Japan, there's also a traditional sedan without the lift kit, and this smaller crossover, the Crown Sport. That model is now getting a charging port and a more potent powertrain, but still won't be coming to the U.S.
Smaller than the Crown Signia, the JDM-spec Crown Sport looks like Japan's Ferrari Purosangue, especially in red paint. Sadly, it doesn't have a V12, but it's still pretty powerful by Toyota standards. With a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor, it has a combined output of 302 horsepower delivered to all four wheels.
For the PHEV variant, Toyota upped the stopping power by upgrading the front brakes with 20-inch discs hugged by six-piston calipers, finished in red at both axles. It also went through the trouble of fitting paddle shifters, although we can't imagine many drivers using them on a plug-in hybrid SUV. Compared to the non-plug-in hybrid Crown Sport, this new variant has extra bracing in the floor tunnel for greater body rigidity.
Since this is a plug-in hybrid, it predictably excels in terms of efficiency. Located beneath the floor in the center of the vehicle is a lithium-ion battery with enough juice for a pure electric range of 56 miles (90 kilometers). It takes 38 minutes to charge the battery to 80 percent. Factor in the gasoline tank with its capacity of 14.5 gallons (55 liters), and the vehicle will be able to cover more than 746 miles (1,200 kilometers).
It rides on large 21-inch black wheels with wider tires and benefits from an adaptive suspension with modified shock absorbers. Toyota goes as far as to say the Crown Sport PHEV delivers a ""planted ride.""
One neat feature is support for bidirectional charging as the 1,500W (AC 100V) external power supply function might come in handy in an emergency. It can also power a variety of devices an outdoorsy person might need out in the wilderness. The Crown Sport PHEV costs 7,650,000 yen (about $52,900) and Toyota expects to move about 300 units each month.

This Nissan Disaster Support Van Uses Leaf Batteries For Onboard Power,https://www.motor1.com/news/701185/nissan-2024-tokyo-auto-salon/,There will also be a concept with denim upholstery.,2024-12-25 09:06:02,"Essentially Japan's SEMA show but more tasteful, the Tokyo Auto Salon is taking place next month. Nissan is attending the event with a comprehensive lineup of customized vehicles based on existing production cars, plus the Formula E race car.
The Disaster Support Mobile-Hub is based on the Caravan and gets a portable power station by repurposing old batteries from the Nissan Leaf electric hatchback. As the concept's name implies, the van-based mobile support hub is intended to be used in case of disasters such as earthquakes and floods when there's no power.
Sold in Japan as the X-Trail, Nissan is teasing the Rogue alongside the Crawler Concept. It has a raised suspension and a chunky roof rack with a built-in LED light bar. The rock-crawling SUV probably rides on all-terrain tires and has a beefier body kit with extra cladding. Nissan says the cargo compartment ""contains the tools that have always been looked for in the X-Trail.""
In case you're unfamiliar with the Roox, it's a tiny minivan developed to comply with the kei car regulations. It’s based on the Mitsubishi eK Space and went through a facelift in Japan a few months ago. This Beams Customized Concept has been created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion house Beams and incorporates denim fabric inside and out.
Just as quirky is the March Customized Concept. March is the name used by Nissan in its domestic market for the Micra supermini. For the 2024 TAS, the small hatchback has been modified to fit the needs of a pastry chef. It boasts a variety of wooden elements and has a menu written down on the rear doors' windows.
Joining these cars will be sportier-looking versions of the X-Trail Autech crossover and Serena Autech minivan as well as Nismo variants of the Skyline, Z, and GT-R. The next Tokyo Auto Salon takes place January 12-14, 2024.

2026 Cadillac Vistiq Three-Row SUV Is The Electric Baby Escalade,https://insideevs.com/news/700432/2026-cadillac-vistiq-debut/,The tailgate badge suggests the Vistiq gets the Lyriq AWD's dual-motor powertrain rated at 500 hp and 450 lb-ft.,2023-12-14 09:00:00,"Cadillac has way more electric vehicle models in the ""upcoming releases"" section than in showrooms, and you can add a new one to that list—the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq midsize SUV.
Don't get us wrong, the more EVs the better, but we hope Cadillac will be able to launch and manufacture these new models as planned. After all, the Lyriq's rollout has been far from ideal in that respect. Now, GM's luxury arm describes the Vistiq as a ""distinctive and innovative"" EV designed for the modern family, but unfortunately, it provides very few details about the new model.
The Vistiq looks like a good addition to the lineup, but when will it launch?
The 2026 Cadillac Vistiq will join a market segment that's not that crowded at the moment, that of mid-size luxury three-row electric SUVs. But GM has had so many delays with its EVs that we can't help but wonder when the Vistiq will hit the market—the fact that it's a 2026 model year doesn't look that encouraging.
This is a new luxury three-row SUV that will slot between the Lyriq—Cadillac's only EV on sale at the moment—and the forthcoming Escalade IQ. Think of it as the all-electric equivalent to the Cadillac XT6 but with the same styling language we've already seen on the Lyriq, Optiq, and Escalade IQ.
Actually, it looks like a baby Escalade IQ, although the body appears slightly better proportioned in these photos. Photos of the interior aren't available yet, but we should probably expect influences from both the Lyriq and Escalade IQ when it comes to the looks and functionality of the cabin.
""Vistiq adds another compelling EV to the Cadillac lineup, reinforcing our commitment to an electric future,"" said John Roth, vice president of Global Cadillac. ""Our brand now has an EV entry in most luxury segments, offering customers a range of choices, and Cadillac EVs will cover most luxury SUV segments across critical global markets in the next two years.""
Additional Vistiq details, including available features and pricing, will be released sometime next year when the full unveiling takes place. The Vistiq utilizes GM's Ultium battery and drive units, just like the other electric SUVs Cadillac has announced so far and the rest of the GM EV family. Given its size and positioning, it may use the BEV3 architecture and not the Escalade IQ's BT1 SUV/truck platform that's shared with the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and more upcoming models.
It remains to be seen which drivetrain configurations the Vistiq will offer, but a dual-motor AWD setup is a given, either standard or as an option. We say that because of the ""600E4"" badge visible on the Vistiq's tailgate in one of the photos. The ""600"" represents the rounded torque figure in Newton-meters (for some reason), while ""E4"" stands for ""electric"" and ""four-wheel drive.""
More stories on all-electric Cadillac models
An identical badge is used by the Lyriq AWD, so it's safe to assume that the Vistiq gets the same dual-motor AWD powertrain that makes 500 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque. Does it also get the 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack that enables a range of 307 miles in the Lyriq? We don't know, but if it does, we expect the range to take a significant hit. A single-motor RWD powertrain could be offered as standard, but that's just speculation.
The Escalade IQ's standard AWD setup that delivers 680 hp and 615 lb-ft of torque in the normal driving mode would probably be a good fit as a range-topping powertrain for the Vistiq, although we doubt Cadillac will put a 200-kWh+ battery in its midsize SUV.
Still, the beauty of GM's BEV3 platform and its Ultium batteries and drive units is that they're very modular and configurable, so General Motors has probably been able to tailor the ideal drivetrain for the Vistiq, including a right-sized battery pack.
The Vistiq is Cadillac's fifth EV and the third one confirmed this year, after the Escalade IQ and the Optiq, which acts as the Cadillac EV lineup's entry point in North America starting in 2024. How will the Vistiq stack up when it goes on sale? And more importantly given it's a 2026MY, when will it go on sale?",Dan Mihalascu
"Tesla Model 3 RWD, Long Range Will Lose The Entire EV Tax Credit In 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/700533/tesla-model-3-rwd-long-range-lose-entire-tax-credit-2024/,Tesla’s most affordable EV takes a hit because of its Chinese-sourced batteries.,2023-12-13 06:39:07,"Buyers of Tesla’s most affordable model, the Model 3 sedan, will no longer be eligible for the $7,500 U.S. electric vehicle tax credit starting next year, at least when it comes to the Rear-Wheel Drive and Long Range versions.
The news comes from Tesla itself, which already updated its website to reflect the change, likely as a result of the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance that was announced at the beginning of the month.
Confusion around the EV tax credit rules trickles down to car shoppers
The U.S. EV tax credits are changing again in January 2024, to crack down on battery materials from ""foreign entities of concern"" like China. It's confusing to buyers, and losing tax credits a car as important and affordable as the Model 3 could mean bad news for EV sales.
Previously, the electric automaker had a slightly different language on its webpage, instructing potential buyers to take delivery of their new Model 3 before the end of the year because starting from 2024, the RWD and Long Range variants of the EV might benefit from just half of the tax credit.
However, things have changed and buyers of the sedan’s two cheapest options will no longer be eligible for the $7,500 incentive at all. With this being said, the Performance trim doesn’t seem to be affected by this change, at least for now.
Here’s what Tesla says on its website regarding the change:
Customers who take delivery of a qualified new Tesla vehicle and meet all federal requirements are eligible for a tax credit up to $7,500. Tax credit will end for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on December 31, 2023 based on current view of new IRA guidance. Take delivery by December 31 to qualify for full tax credit.
Currently, all the Model 3 trims, the Model X Dual Motor, and the Model Y Long Range and Performance are eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit. That said, there are price caps in place: $55,000 for the Model 3 and $80,000 for both the Model X and Model Y.
In the case of the Model Y, Tesla says that reductions in the tax credit are likely after December 31. However, there is no such language when it comes to the Model X, which incidentally has a starting price of $79,990–just $10 under the $80,000 price cap.
More Stories Like This
Most likely, the change that affects Tesla’s most affordable model has to do with the fact that it’s powered by Chinese-made batteries, but the company hasn’t released details on why the two Model 3 variants are losing the entire tax credit eligibility. The updated tax rules state that any vehicle containing battery components from a so-called “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) like China will be disqualified from receiving tax breaks.
Ultimately, it's certainly not great news for Tesla, which saw record-breaking growth this year—and the continued domination of the U.S. market—thanks to the affordability of the Model 3 and Model Y. It's possible Tesla could cut prices further to compensate, but its investors are already nervous about these changes cutting into profit margins. Even worse off may be other automakers, most of whom can't match Tesla's ability to produce EVs at scale and could see their tax credits evaporate in a few weeks too.",Iulian Dnistran
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Is Officially Going Racing,https://www.motor1.com/news/699916/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-cup/,The Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup car is also getting a lowered sports suspension and slick tires.,2024-12-25 09:06:06,"Hyundai held its N Festival in South Korea last night to celebrate its racing achievements in 2023. But there was a surprise. Hyundai revealed concept images of the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup race car along with some juicy technical specifications, with the goal to finish development work in February 2024.
Featuring an aggressive body kit with massive air intakes, a large diffuser, and a rear wing, the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup sits on 18-inch wheels wrapped in 280/680 R18 slick tires. It gets a stiffer suspension setup lowering the ride height by as much as 2.8 inches. Stopping power is supplied by six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers, and to quickly lift the car, it has an air jack. Hyundai is also giving it a six-point, FIA-compliant roll cage, and upgraded battery protection.
The biggest change will be the weight loss, which estimated to be as much as 551 pounds (250 kilograms). Full details have yet to be disclosed since the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup is still being developed, but we do know the side and rear glass is being replaced with polycarbonate. We still don't know how much the street-legal Ioniq 5 N weighs, but it’s estimated to tip the scales at 4,650 lbs (2,109 kg).
Additional hardware changes include an adjustable suspension with spherical-joint pillowball mounts to stiffen the connection with the chassis. It also has disconnectors in case the battery runs too hot. Each team that will race the Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup will have its own fake engine sound. In addition, the drivers will be allowed to simulate gear changes by using the N E-Shift function, which mimics the behavior of an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
The Ioniq 5 eN1 Cup is more than just for show since it'll actually go racing. If everything goes according to plan, it'll hit the track as early as May 2024 in what Hyundai refers to as Korea's first one-make EV competition.

BYD Seal Lands In Mexico To Taunt The Tesla Model 3 From The Other Side Of The Border,https://insideevs.com/news/699895/byd-seal-north-america-debut/,The Chinese sedan is one of the most compelling EV contenders to enter North America. But would you buy one in the U.S.?,2023-12-08 08:57:23,"The BYD Seal, which is considered one of the better competitors to the Tesla Model 3, has officially launched in North America, according to CarNewsChina. But don’t get your hopes too high because the EV’s arrival in the United States is still uncertain.
But take a trip over the border to Mexico, and you’ll be able to check out the Chinese battery-powered car in person–along with its sticker price.
Representing the fifth battery-powered car to be sold in Mexico by BYD, after the Han sedan, Tang SUV, Yuan Plus crossover, and Dolphin hatchback, the Seal starts at 778,800 pesos, or about $44,800, for the entry-level rear-wheel drive version.
This comes with a 150-kilowatt (201 horsepower) rear-mounted electric motor and a 61.44-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate (LFP) Blade battery pack that enables a WLTP-rated range of 285 miles (460 kilometers).
There’s also an all-wheel drive version that features two electric motors making a combined 390 kW (529 hp) and a bigger 82.56-kWh LFP Blade battery that offers a WLTP range of 323 miles (520 km). The AWD costs 888,800 pesos, which translates to about $52,000.
More Chinese EVs
Now for the price comparison. In the U.S., the Tesla Model 3 is cheaper, starting at $38,990, but in Mexico, the American EV is actually more expensive than the imported Chinese sedan, with a base MSRP of 881,900 pesos, which is about $50,500.
It’s worth noting that BYD doesn’t sell any of its passenger cars in the United States at the moment, but it’s planning to do so in the future, with a Mexican factory being under consideration. With this being said, the Chinese manufacturer has a presence in the U.S., but for electric buses, assembling mainly school buses at its factory in Lancaster, California.
Chinese cars in general are a very hot topic in the U.S. Due to continued geopolitical and trade tensions between the two countries, Chinese-made cars are subject to stiff 27.5% tariffs, including from established brands like Volvo, and that is keeping companies like BYD from selling in the U.S. for now. But while the tariff is unlikely to vanish anytime soon, BYD and the other major Chinese automakers have huge global plans. And in theory, building cars at their own factories in Mexico—which many of them are planning to do—allows them to sell in the U.S. without the tariffs.
The question is, would American buyers go for a BYD Seal over a Tesla Model 3? In the next few years, we may just find out.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Next Chevrolet Bolt Will Be EUV-Only, GM Confirms",https://insideevs.com/news/699880/gm-bolt-euv-2025/,"The larger version of the popular Bolt is the only one making a comeback in 2025, the automaker told InsideEVs.",2023-12-07 16:42:47,"The Chevrolet Bolt is having its best sales year ever—right in time for it to get canceled. But General Motors is responding to the immense popularity of the pair of compact electric vehicles by releasing a heavily updated Bolt with more advanced hardware in 2025. And when it does, only the larger Bolt EUV will be on the menu.
GM officials confirmed to InsideEVs this week that the upcoming next-generation Bolt will be EUV-only, citing the overwhelming popularity of the crossover model over the smaller Bolt EV. “We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt. We will share details as we get closer to its launch date,"" a GM spokesperson added. ""We’re excited, as the new Bolt will build on the formula that has made it the success it is today.""
What to know about the Bolt's big(ger) comeback
GM angered quite a few EV fans by killing off the ultra-popular and affordable (but unprofitable) Bolt. Now that it's coming back as a small crossover, its success will depend on keeping that cheap price tag.
That success is clearly pointing in the direction of the crossover model. Though GM doesn't break out the sales figures between the Bolt EV and the Bolt EUV, it's generally believed the latter is outselling the former about two-to-one.
Between January and September, Chevrolet sold 49,494 examples of both models combined, a staggering 125% increase from the same period in 2022. By an extremely wide margin, the Bolt twins have been GM's most popular EVs, especially as it has occasionally struggled to scale up production for next-generation EVs on the Ultium platform like the Cadillac Lyriq, Hummer EV and Silverado EV.
But this year, scores of buyers were drawn to the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV thanks to its low price tag being further cut by the new Inflation Reduction Act's electric tax credits. Between federal and state tax credits, as well as dealer discounts, many Bolt models were acquired in the $20,000 realm—not bad at all for an EV with a respectable 259- or 247-mile range, depending on size.
The Bolt Is Back (In 2025)
At the same time, the Bolt is getting old. The smaller one first debuted way back in 2016 and was joined by the compact EUV crossover in 2022. It is only capable of 55 kW DC fast charging, making it far less quick to add range than more modern rivals. Moreover, the Bolt's older battery setup was said to be long unprofitable, leading to its cancellation earlier this year.
But GM quickly reversed that decision, citing the car's popularity, and said the next Bolt would instead use the Ultium batteries and architecture underpinning other new EVs—thus allowing it to be scaled up profitably.
GM officials, including CEO Mary Barra, have said the next Bolt will not be a clean-sheet redesign but rather an updated version of the current car with lower-cost LFP batteries, faster charging, more advanced active safety features and other significant upgrades. But the plan is to keep the next-gen Bolt around the same level of pricing, which is good news, as high EV costs are continually seen as a major barrier to wider adoption.
In any case, given the Bolt EUV's success with crossover-crazy Americans, it's no wonder that GM would opt to go with that body style as the car's sole Ultium-based successor. If the automaker can hold true to that claim around the low price tag, it will almost certainly have another major hit on its hands.",Patrick George
"Morgan's New Electric Three-Wheeler Only Weighs 1,540 Pounds",https://www.motor1.com/news/699515/morgan-three-wheeler-ev-details/,And it will do 150 miles on a single charge.,2024-12-25 09:06:10,"Even the smallest automakers must adapt to the inevitable electric future. And for sports car manufacturers focused on weight, installing a battery pack and an electric motor can be a tough task compared to the equivalent combustion engine.
Caterham showed that minimizing the weight penalty is doable with its Project V electric coupe. Now, another British marque is revealing what it has achieved so far in terms of a sporty, lightweight EV.
Meet the Morgan XP-1, an experimental prototype with an all-electric heart. It's based on the Ford-powered Super 3, but it has had its oily bits yanked off to make room for the new hardware. Fun fact: This car uses Morgan's first powertrain developed in-house, regardless of whether we're talking about a combustion engine or an electric motor.
To keep development costs low, the engineers mounted the electric motor in the existing transmission tunnel. It's good for 134 horsepower (100 kilowatts) routed to that single rear wheel. The e-motor gets its juice from a tiny 33-kilowatt-hour battery pack mounted under the hood where you'd normally find the gasoline engine in the Super 3. Fully charged, the battery is good for approximately 150 miles (241 kilometers) of range.
Tipping the scales at less than 1,543 pounds (700 kilograms), the Morgan XP-1 is only about 132 lbs (60 kg) heavier than its gas counterpart. While the donor car has a drag coefficient of 0.65, the Cd has dropped to 0.42 after tweaking the underbody, wheels, and front fascia. These changes have lowered the drag coefficient by a third to maximize efficiency.
The Morgan XP-1 has been developed with four selectable drive modes that are hilariously illustrated on the digital driver's display by chili symbols. To cope with the extra heft, the electric three-wheeler has been fitted with Nitron adjustable dampers while the spring rates have been changed. As for the battery, it supports fast charging, and it even has a bi-directional charging capability.
Morgan isn't ready to talk about a potential production version, but Chief Technical Officer Matt Hole told Autocar it would cost ""just north of Super 3."" The Ford-powered model retails for $53,938 in the United States where there are 12 showrooms.

Honda To Unveil A Whole New 'EV Series' At CES In January,https://insideevs.com/news/699494/honda-ces-preview-2024/,"If Honda is really getting serious about EVs, we may see some evidence soon.",2023-12-06 09:00:00,"Honda has been saying for a while now that it plans to sell 30 new all-electric models by 2030. I don't know if any of you have checked the calendar recently, but by my calculations, that's six years and 25 days from now. At present, Honda's global electric presence includes the not-for-North America Honda e, some joint venture stuff for China, the upcoming Prologue SUV with hardware on loan from General Motors and a few other stragglers. Just how does Honda think it's going to accomplish that lofty goal, exactly?
We may get some answers to that $40 billion question in January at CES. There, the Japanese automaker says it's going to unveil a ""global EV series [and] several key technologies that illustrate the significant transformation Honda is currently undergoing."" A number of Honda executives will be at the tech trade show to speak to what's next for the apparently electric future.
More Honda News
""Toward its global goal to achieve carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities by 2050, Honda will introduce 30 new EVs globally by 2030 with a global sales volume of 2 million units,"" the automaker said in a news release. ""In North America, Honda has laid out an aggressive timeline of EV introductions leading to 2030 and ultimately to 100% zero-emission automobile sales by 2040, which includes battery electric and fuel cell electric-powered models.""
For now, that's all we know. The announcement came with this cryptic teaser, which you can see above. It's hard to draw any real conclusions from that image; it looks. to be some kind of sleek concept car with a sharply angled windscreen and a flat nose, if that's the front end, and I think it is.
Truth be told, it's great to see Honda get serious about EVs—an area where all of the Japanese automakers are sorely lacking at present, much to the chagrin of their environmentally minded fans. (Honda's even down to just two hybrids in the U.S., though a third is coming.) But of all of Japan's car companies, Honda built its legendary reputation on a total approach to what you'd call ""mobility"" today—cars, motorcycles, scooters, lawnmowers, even planes and robots—and brilliant engineering solutions. If any of those car companies can come up with truly memorable entries in the EV space, I always thought it might be Honda. And it's worth noting that Honda just scrapped its partnership for small, affordable EVs with GM, so whatever this plan is, it seems to be a solo act.
Now, things do seem to be looking up on the electrified front for Honda. It's got more hybrids coming, including the 2024 Civic Hybrid and the all-but-confirmed Honda Prelude. (I've seen the latter up close and in person twice now, and if anyone thinks it's just a ""concept,"" I have a bridge to sell them.) It's also got more in the works for electric motorcycles and scooters; plans to re-tool its plants in Ohio and Japan for EV production; and the Prologue's upscale cousin, the Acura ZDX.
Here's hoping for positive and concrete news out of CES come Jan. 9. The world could use more great electric Hondas, and ones Americans can actually buy, too.",Patrick George
The 2024 Lucid Air Lineup Just Got A Whole Lot Simpler,https://insideevs.com/news/699263/lucid-air-2024-updated/,"The Pure gets more range, but the 1,050 horsepower Grand Touring Performance trim is dead.",2023-12-05 09:00:00,"I love the Lucid Air. It’s one of my favorite EVs on the market. But it seems like not everyone else has felt the love, if the brand’s lackluster sales are any indication. (The approximately $80,000 to $250,000 price tag may have contributed to this.) Regardless, it looks like Lucid’s gearing up for a fight to win the hearts and minds of the EV-buying public. For 2024, the startup has made the car even more competitive and alluring with an updated model line that includes adjusted pricing, reworked trim levels, a new color and new packages so consumers can spec their Air sedan just to their liking.
First up is the Pure trim. Acting as the entry to the Lucid brand, it starts at $77,400, slightly cheaper than its 2023 price. The next trim up, the Touring, now starts at $85,900—a sizable reduction from the $95,000 in 2023. However, the real story is how simplified the model lineup is for 2024, all while making the base Air Pure a better deal.
For example, the Pure trim now has a choice of interior themes and materials. Consumers can equip the natural grain or nappa leather interior options, rather than just the PureTex grey synthetic leather interior options. The Pure trim can now be had with 14 or 20-way power seats that have both ventilation and massage features.
Mechanically, the Air’s powertrain lineup is simplified. The dual motor Pure AWD is dead, making the Pure trim RWD, a single motor only. The motor itself still makes the same 430 horsepower as before, but this time the car now returns an estimated 419 miles of range, up from 410 miles from last year's model.
If you’re in search of extra power and AWD, you’ll now have to step up to the Air Touring. The Touring model is now the cheapest way to get an AWD dual-motor Lucid Air, and at 620 horsepower, it’s way faster than the outgoing AWD Air Pure.
The Touring and Pure are both available with a new Comfort and Convenience package. This package adds niceties like a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, soft-close doors, four-zone climate control, and power rear sunshades. When equipped on the Touring model, Lucid throws in a power opening and closing frunk and heated wipers. Oh, and that Fathom Blue exterior paint once only found on the base model Pure trim is now available on the Touring and Grand Touring models.
Speaking of the Grand Touring, Lucid updated that model as well. But it hasn’t quite let all of the details out. It too, will get the optional 20-way power seats and mechanical upgrades via an “updated powertrain that enhances thermal performance and enables more sustained spirited driving.” But, the actual pricing, range, and battery capacity are still to be determined. Lucid says it expects the Air Grand Touring to remain the longest-range electric luxury sedan in the US, though. Sadly, the 1,050 horsepower Grand Touring Performance model is gone from the lineup.
These updates seem like a solid way to make a good car more compelling in an increasingly crowded EV luxury market. For Lucid’s sake, let’s hope these updates are enough to get drivers behind the wheel of the Air. And down the line, backup is coming in the form of the Lucid Gravity SUV as well.
Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that the Lucid Air Touring was $95,000 in 2023, not $87,500.

"The 2024 Fiat 500e Is A $32,500 Answer To Big, Expensive EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/699277/2024-fiat-500e-revealed/,Fiat’s iconic city car returns to the U.S. with 149 miles of range and a price that’s tough to beat.,2023-12-05 00:01:00,"The U.S. is in dire need of electric cars that are affordable to everyday consumers. Right now, if you pick a new EV at random, it’s likely to cost upwards of $50,000. And that just isn’t realistic for most people—especially those taking the plunge into an unfamiliar technology.
Good news: A new, relatively accessible option will arrive early next year in the form of the 2024 Fiat 500e. The iconic Italian city car is returning stateside after a brief hiatus, and Fiat unveiled it to the world on Tuesday. It went on sale in Europe in 2020.
The (500e)RED edition, the first model available, will start at $32,500 plus a $1,595 destination fee. While that isn't exactly cheap, it's a lot less than the average going price for an EV, which was $51,762 in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Fiat plans to “drop” future variants in limited quantities, as fashion brands do. While I’m not sure people will line up for the latest Fiat colorway like they do for Supreme hoodies, Fiat thinks there’s something to the strategy.
Just like its predecessor, the new 500e sports two doors, four seats, retro-inspired flair, and a tiny footprint meant for squeezing into the tightest of parking spots. In a time when automakers keep doubling down on bulky electric pickups and SUVs, some buyers may appreciate a legitimately compact and energy-efficient option. Plus, Fiat says the updated model is both longer and wider than before, yielding more interior space.
The (500e)RED’s funky cabin features lots of red accents, a rounded gauge cluster, and a red dashboard insert made of shiny plastic. Alongside the 7-inch driver-facing display is a 10.25-inch center touchscreen equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Now for the really important stuff: range and charging. Fiat estimates the 500e’s range at 149 miles, which is roughly what you’d expect from such a small car with a consequently tiny 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack.
Interestingly, the 500e will be sold with a Level 2 charger that buyers can have installed in their garage or driveway. When plugged into a Level 2 connection (faster than a regular wall outlet, not as fast as DC public fast-charging), the hatchback can top up its battery in four hours and 15 minutes, Fiat says.
Using a DC fast charger (the more powerful kind found at highway rest stops and Tesla Supercharger locations), the 500e can recharge from empty to 80% in 35 minutes, according to Fiat. The 500e maxes out at a charging rate of 85 kW, slower than most other EVs. But it all balances out, since the car’s small battery pack doesn’t need much time to charge anyway.
The car’s 118 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque propel it to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, Fiat says. There are three drive modes. “Normal” is, well, normal. “Range” intensifies regenerative braking to slow the car down harder and send more power to the battery pack under braking. The oddly named “Sherpa” mode maximizes the remaining range by capping the 500e’s power output and top speed.
More Cheap EVs
In somewhat gimmicky news, at low speeds, the 500e doesn’t just emit the typical drone required of EVs for pedestrian awareness. It “sings.”
From Fiat: “The Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) ‘sings’ to pedestrians with a song titled ‘The sound of 500,’ authored by Flavio Ibba-Marco Gualdi. The exclusive melody gives a taste of Italian culture during the first moments of every drive.” That doesn’t sound annoying at all. Nope.
So, is the 500e a good buy? That depends on what you’re after. Rivals include the Mini Electric, which is in the same ballpark as the 500e cost-wise but delivers only 114 miles of range. Then there’s the stalwart Nissan Leaf, which starts at around $25,000 (after a $3,750 federal tax credit) for a model with 149 miles of range. A 259-mile Chevrolet Bolt can be had for roughly $20,000, including a $7,500 kickback from the federal government.
For buyers who don’t need road-tripping range and want something they can park anywhere, the 500e may be just the ticket.",Tim Levin
"Tesla Cybertruck Battery Size, Heat Pump And Colored Charging Indicator Revealed In EPA Docs",https://insideevs.com/news/699248/tesla-cybertruck-battery-size-and-heat-pump/,"Here's what we know from the official specs, including the gross weight of the Cyberbeast.",2023-12-04 17:30:57,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released its official Tesla Cybertruck filings, revealing additional details about the stainless steel triangle on wheels that few people seem to have had enough of. The information in the documents, reviewed by InsideEVs, is not earth-shattering by any measure, but some details are worth noting.
For starters, the Certification Summary Information Report, filed on November 21, 2023, just ten days before the buoyant delivery event, mentions the total voltage of battery packs at 816 volts, battery energy capacity at 150 (amp hours, we believe), and battery specific energy at 170 (watt-hours per kilogram, we believe). That leaves us with 122.4 kilowatt-hours of energy capacity—in line with the unofficial value of 123 kWh in some reports. Annoyingly, Tesla does not release the battery capacity of its EVs.
Moving on, the initial application for the Certificate For Conformity was filed by Tesla on November 11, 2023, and that document confirms the presence of a heat pump. Well, that’s not entirely surprising because most new Teslas get the heat pump, and we also saw some spy shots early this year, shared by members of the Cybertruck Owners Club, that exposed the cooling systems behind the frunk.
For those who don’t know, Tesla’s ingenious heat pump design is its solution to minimize heat losses and maximize range and efficiency. In principle, heat pumps reuse the heat generated by the battery and drive units to warm the cabin, save energy, and improve the range on long drives—they’re crucial in the winter when range losses tend to be higher. Here’s what the document says about the heat pump:
The heater unit incorporating a variable speed electric fan is located in the front of the chassis tub with ducting directing the blown air to defrost, face level and floor level vents in the passenger compartment. The heater element is of the heat pump, drawing HV electrical energy from the battery pack High Voltage.
It goes on to mention how the HVAC system reduces energy usage in both heating and cooling scenarios:
The energy required to heat the cabin varies by weather and occupant comfort needs, but on average consumes approximately 10 percent of the total energy available for driving. However, even in moderately cold weather (0 degrees Celsius), consumption can increase to 25 percent or more. A heat pump consumes a small amount of electrical energy to thermodynamically “upgrade” low-temperature (less useful) thermal energy to higher-temperature (more useful) thermal energy, making it suitable for occupant comfort. That is, for a given electrical power input, a heat pump will return 1 to 5x in useful heating power; an electrical cabin heater provides 1:1 in heating power, and therefore is far less efficient.
That said, we also found a quirky little detail about the Cybertruck’s charging. The charging port, mounted on the rear left fender, will put on a colorful display regarding its state of charge (SoC). For example, a solid white illumination indicates that the charging cable can be removed or inserted. An orange light would indicate that the cable isn’t properly latched, and a flashing blue light would signal that charging is underway as expected, among others.
Lastly, the curb weight of the Cyberbeast is 6,898 pounds, and the all-wheel-drive tips scale at 6,669 pounds. The gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is 9,169 pounds for both variants. We were hoping to find details about the rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck, due in 2025, as well. But the EPA hasn’t made those files public yet. That said, the EPA documents are publicly available, so anyone can review them. Let us know if you find any additional interesting nuggets of information worth highlighting.

"Tesla Model 3 RWD, Long Range EV Tax Credits Halved For 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/699154/tesla-model-3-rwd-long-range-ev-tax-credits-halved-for-2024/,"The change goes into effect January 1, 2024, likely as a result of the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance announced last week.",2023-12-04 08:10:36,"Some potentially bad news for any hopeful Tesla owners next year: the two most popular Model 3 variants, the RWD and Long Range, will see their federal tax credits halved come Jan. 1, 2024 thanks to new rules around battery materials in electric cars.
Instead of being eligible for up to $7,500 as it's still the case now, the two Model 3 trims will qualify for up to $3,750 starting next year under the updated Inflation Reduction Act guidance announced last week.
Tesla has confirmed this on its customer website, informing prospective customers that they can still get the full tax credit if they take delivery of a Model 3 RWD or Long Range by Dec. 31.
""Customers who take delivery of a qualified new Tesla and meet all federal requirements are eligible for a tax credit up to $7,500. Tax credit will reduce to $3,750 for Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range on Jan 1, 2024. Take delivery by Dec 31 for full tax credit. Only for eligible cash or loan purchases,"" reads Tesla's announcement.
The electric automaker had posted a similar message on its Model 3 page since July, informing customers that reductions to the federal tax credit were ""likely"" starting from 2024. However, Tesla did not say which Model 3 variants might see their federal tax credit reduced at the time.
Now the new tax rules are clear, and the Model 3 RWD and LR are likely penalized because their battery packs contain components from a so-called ""foreign entity of concern""—in this case, China. Tesla has not revealed details on why its Model 3 variants are losing full tax credit eligibility.
If you're in the market for a Tesla Model 3 and want to take advantage of the full tax credit this month, you should know the electric sedan also comes with six months of free Supercharging if you take delivery by Dec. 31.
More Tesla Model 3 stories
This promotion is likely part of Tesla's efforts to boost sales for the 2023 calendar year. In its third-quarter earnings call on October 18, the company reiterated its 1.8 million vehicle delivery goal. In the first three quarters of this year, Tesla delivered 1,324,074 vehicles worldwide, the vast majority of which were Model Y and Model 3 EVs (1,278,169 units).
As for what will happen with U.S. EV prices under the revised tax credit rules next year, that remains unclear. More models could see their tax credits evaporate until EV and battery production scales up in the U.S. without Chinese materials, which could hurt EV adoption in the meantime. But given his penchant for rapid-fire price changes this year alone, it's entirely possible Tesla CEO Elon Musk will make his own tweaks to keep his company's sales up.",Dan Mihalascu
"BMW iM3 Will 'Never' Happen, Says M Boss",https://www.motor1.com/news/698755/bmw-im3-ev-not-happening/,But that's not to say an M3 with batteries won't.,2024-12-25 09:06:17,"Earlier this week, BMW filed a trademark for the name ""iM3."" Combining BMW's electric ""i"" and performance ""M"" badges would theoretically suggest a hot EV, but BMW M boss Frank van Meel is here to quickly shut down those rumors.
In an interview with Top Gear, van Meel said the company would ""never"" use i and M badges together on the same vehicle. ""No, that will be a Mission Impossible!"" he says. ""Actually, we would never use an i on an M, even though it would be electric.""
That's not to say that a performance EV with a pure M badge won't happen, though. ""If we would ever do something like that, it will always be called an M without an i,"" suggests van Meel, ""because that's just the technology, and M is not about technology. It’s about a promise, it’s about motorsports, it’s about emotion. It’s not about the drivetrain.""
BMW already has four M-badged EVs – the iX M60, i4 M50, i5 M60, and the i7 M70 – and the company debuted a quad-motor performance prototype in 2022 that looked suspiciously like a 3 Series. So the BMW Neue Klasse electric platform is bound to breed a performance EV, it just won't be called the iM3.

UPDATE: You Can Reserve A Tesla Cybertruck,https://insideevs.com/news/698521/tesla-no-cybertruck-reservations/,The price to reserve one has gone up though.,2023-11-30 16:21:48,"UPDATE: Just moments ago, Tesla re-opened reservations for the Cybertruck. Reservations are now $250 and are still fully refundable.
Original article continues below...
As of last night, Tesla is no longer taking reservations for the Cybertruck. Perhaps the millions who have already reserved a Cybertruck are more than Tesla thinks it can handle in the foreseeable future.
Tesla's Cybertruck landing page now shows a countdown timer to tomorrow's big delivery event. There is no longer a way to bank a reservation for the Cybertruck, which means that, at least for now, reserving a Cybertruck is not possible.
Prior to removing the option to reserve a Cybertruck, Tesla briefly updated the page to show a $250 reservation fee, which is higher than the initial $100 reservation fee. The change didn't last for long though, as Tesla quickly reverted back to the $100 amount before removing the option to reserve one.
According to some crowdsourced info, Tesla Cybertruck reservations surpassed 2 million back in September of this year. The same crowdsourced tracker estimated that Cybertruck reservations reached 1 million in May 2021, 1.25 million in August 2021, and 1.3 million in November 2021. We suspect the number to be significantly higher now that the debut is near and the truck has been out on public roads and on display in recent months.
The anticipation continues to build ahead of tomorrow's Cybertruck debut and delivery event, which is set to begin at 3 P.M. Eastern time. We'll livestream the event and have full coverage of everything Cybertruck, so be sure to join us tomorrow for all of the Cybertruck news.

Tesla Cybertruck: The Full Delivery Specs,https://insideevs.com/news/698764/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-specs-power-range-price/,"Dimensions, towing capacity and more. Here’s everything you need to know about the Cybertruck. Finally.",2023-11-30 15:46:47,"Remember when the Tesla Cybertruck was first revealed four years ago? Yes, it’s been that long, but the wait is sort of, kind of finally over because the first production-spec units of the heavily anticipated electric pickup truck have been delivered during a special event held at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas, right next to the factory that is building Tesla's latest passenger EV.
And I say that the wait is sort of over because just 10 to 50 units were reportedly delivered at today’s event, depending on who you ask, so the bulk of reservation holders–all two million of them, according to an unofficial tracker–will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on what is arguably one of the most controversial cars in recent history.
So, after years of speculation, spy shots, rumors, and a fair share of confusing messages from none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the cat is out of the bag, at least in terms of official specs.
The Cybertruck, in all its production-spec glory, has a maximum combined power output of 845 horsepower in the so-called Beast Mode. According to Tesla, the Cybertruck is capable of accelerating faster than a Porsche 911 while towing a Porsche 911.
The front drive unit itself makes over 300 hp and features an electro-mechanical differential lock that should come in handy when going off-road. There's no word on a rear locker, but Tesla said that the Cybertruck has active torque vectoring. Additionally, in a first for Tesla, there's a steer-by-wire system instead of a traditional mechanical steering column.
As per the company's website, there are three versions on offer: Rear-Wheel Drive with an estimated 250 miles of range and a 0-60 miles per hour time of 6.5 seconds, All-Wheel Drive with an estimated 340 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds, and Cyberbeast, which can drive up to 320 miles on a full charge (estimated) and can reach 60 mph in 2.6 seconds.
A peculiar Range Extender option also appears on the specs portion of the website. With it, the AWD variant has over 470 miles of range, while the Cyberbeast can go for over 440 miles. According to Elon Musk, there will be an additional battery pack that fits in about one-third of the bed. This can be added or removed depending on the owner's needs.
The front trunk is called the Powergate on the Cybertruck and it's Tesla's first-ever powered frunk. It incorporates one of the longest LED lighting elements on any passenger vehicle in the world, according to the company, and when opened reveals a hidden bench that can seat two, as well as more than seven cubic feet of space.
Compared to the Ford F-150 Lightning's 14.1-cu ft front trunk, the Cybertruck's frunk is about half the size.
In the back of the truck, there's the so-called Vault, which is a fancy way of saying it has an under-bed storage compartment. This doesn't seem big enough for a spare wheel but it's weather-sealed and has a drain hole on the bottom, so it could be used to keep some food and drinks cold in ice, and then when you're done and the ice has melted, you just need to pop off the plug. Speaking of a spare wheel, the Cybertruck doesn't have one.
The bed, which is covered by a powered tonneau cover that retracts behind the rear seats, measures 6 feet long and 4 feet wide. It's made out of sheet-molded composite (SMC) and, according to Tesla, it eliminates the need to install an aftermarket bed liner because it's plenty durable.
Adaptive air suspension comes as standard and offers multiple height settings, similar to the Rivian R1T. At its maximum suspension level, the Cybertruck has a ride height of 17 inches. Rear-wheel steering is also part of the mix.
Pricing starts at an estimated $60,990 for the base RWD model that will be available in 2025. The All-Wheel Drive model will cost an estimated $79,990 when it gets delivered next year, and the Cyberbeast has an estimated MSRP of $99,990 with deliveries expected to begin next year.
The Cybertruck weighs about 6,700 pounds, depending on the version, which is more than the Ford F-150 Lightning which tips the scales at roughly 6,300 lbs but less than the GMC Hummer EV which weighs over 9,000 lbs.
There's still no word on the size of the battery pack.
More Cybertruck Stories
The truck is covered in a Tesla-designed stainless steel alloy, which didn't exist before, according to Elon Musk. It is immune to corrosion, it doesn't need paint, and it gives the Cybertruck more torsional stiffness than a McLaren P1, Musk added.
The company also recreated the failed steel ball experiment from four years ago but this time around Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, didn't seem to use a steel ball but rather a softball that simply bounced off the side of the truck.
According to Tesla's CEO, the Cybertruck's center of gravity is so low that it won't flip over in case of a crash.
Here's a list of all the specs that have been announced today:
Compared to the initial specs that were displayed during the truck’s debut in 2019, the final numbers are slightly worse: lower towing capability, shorter range, and a smaller bed. Four years ago, Tesla’s pickup was advertised with the following specifications:
As you can see, the final version of the truck can't tow or carry quite as much weight as it was originally envisioned. The prices are also higher than what was initially promised, but that's not really a surprise considering everything that happened in the world in the past five years.
It's arguably a controversial car, but now that we know more specs, do you think it lives up to all the hype? Let us know in the comments below.

Watch The Tesla Cybertruck Debut And Delivery Livestream Here,https://insideevs.com/news/698309/tesla-cybertruck-debut-delivery-livestream-video/,The livestream starts at around 3 P.M. Eastern (12 P.M. Pacific).,2023-11-30 08:52:59,"Today is the day for the first deliveries of the new and hugely anticipated Tesla Cybertruck. This is perhaps the biggest electric vehicle debut of all time and you can watch it live right here.
Years ago, Tesla released specs and details for the Cybertruck, but some figures have likely changed between then and now. We'll briefly cover some aspects of the Cybertruck below and will update this post in real-time as more information becomes available from Tesla.
Tesla Cybertruck Specs From 2019 Debut
The exterior of the Cybertruck is its most polarizing feature. It is stainless steel, which is not the norm in the auto industry. Additionally, its wedge shape is unusual and the angular design is not very common.
What we do know is that the 3-millimeter-thick stainless steel body panels can stop some lighter rounds of ammunition and that the panels could not be penetrated by an arrow shot by Joe Rogan.
We expect that Tesla will offer factory wraps for the Cybertruck if you prefer it in a color that's not stainless steel.
The inside of the Cybertruck is probably the most ""normal"" part of the truck. It's typical Tesla in the sense that, as our own Editor-in-Chief Patrick George put so precisely ""...the standard Tesla playbook clearly applies here: it's sparse, there's a screen and the Model S-style yoke sits in front of the driver.""
The Cybertruck should be available with either a single-motor / rear-wheel-drive setup, a dual-motor / all-wheel-drive setup, or a tri-motor / all-wheel-drive arrangement. The fastest version can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a claimed time of 2.6 seconds.
Tesla says that the Cybertruck comes with an industry-standard 6-foot pickup bed and it boasts a payload capacity of 2,500 pounds cargo capacity. It can tow up to 11,000 pounds.
For off-roading, it features 17 inches of ground clearance, a 35-degree approach angle and a 28-degree departure angle. The electric truck features an adjustable air suspension and four-wheel steering.
When first announced way back when the Cybertruck pricing started at $39,900 for a single-motor RWD model with 250-plus miles of range and a 0-60 time of 6.5 seconds. The tri-motor flagship Cybertruck had a listed price of $69,900.
We expect that there will be significant changes to the official pricing of the Cybertruck and will update this when and if Tesla makes a pricing announcement.
More Cybertruck Range Info
The range was listed at 250-plus miles for the base version of the Cybertruck and over 500 miles for the top-of-the-line version. The mid-level Cybertruck had a range of over 300 miles. These range figures have likely changed since first announced though.
Stay tuned as we'll have a lot more coverage following the livestream of the Cybertruck delivery event.

New Chinese EV Has Giant TV In The Back And Can Measure Disease Risks,https://www.motor1.com/news/698082/skyworth-skyhome-electric-sedan-china/,"Wait, what?!",2024-12-25 09:06:24,"The Chinese EV industry is booming. Now Skyworth – the automotive subsidiary of Skywell, an electronics company from China – wants to get in on the game with the new Skyhome, a sleek-looking sedan that will go into production next year.
Drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese architectural aesthetics, the EV boasts a design ethos reminiscent of classical pavilions, setting it apart from the conventional EV crowd – or at least that's what the company says in an official press release. One of the highlights is the vehicle's cornice wings, which serve the functional purpose of sliding backward during driving to reduce wind resistance by an impressive three percent. In adverse weather or emergency situations, they tilt up, increasing resistance by five percent for enhanced control.
The Skyhome isn't just about aesthetics, though. The firm responsible for its development says the car has something it calls the Ten Smart Butlers, which is a technology based on AI algorithms, providing a suite of functions ranging from entrepreneurial guidance to emotional support. Yes, you read that part right.
The vehicle's intelligent voice capabilities go beyond the ordinary, boasting the ability to ""listen, speak, see, recognize, understand, and think,"" facilitated by multi-intent voice interaction technology. Even more impressively, the system also incorporates an intelligent non-contact vital signs monitoring system, which is supposed to recognize health risks in very early stages. Again, we are not kidding.
Last but not least, there's also a giant TV for the rear passengers that retracts from the ceiling. We don't know how big it is but from the photos, it looks even bigger than the new BMW 7 Series' 31.1-inch screen at the back.
Skyworth also invested heavily into suspension technology, claiming the new electric sedan has one of the most advanced air suspensions in the industry. It features a double-wishbone front setup, rear aluminum alloy five-link layout, and a perfectly balanced front and rear axle load ratio of 50:50. Also, the overall chassis design with an integrated battery pack, which also acts as the body floor, apparently reduces the number of parts by 127 compared to a conventional EV. The automaker also promises a weight reduction of 24 percent compared to a more conventional design.
There's no official information about the powertrain yet.

Electric Nissan Juke And Qashqai Will Be Inspired By 'Hyper' Concepts,https://insideevs.com/news/697812/electric-nissan-juke-qashqai-will-be-inspired-by-hyper-concepts/,"The electric Juke will be influenced by the Hyper Punk study, while the Qashqai EV will take inspiration from the Hyper Urban concept.",2023-11-24 07:11:21,"Nissan confirmed it will build all-electric future versions of its Juke and Qashqai SUVs alongside the next-gen Leaf at its plant in Sunderland, UK, and said the new EVs will be inspired by its ""Hyper"" series of concepts recently unveiled at Japan Mobility Show.
The Japanese automaker announced it is investing a total of up to 3 billion pounds ($3.75 billion) in the production of the three EVs, the construction of three battery gigafactories with partner Envision AESC—one more than initially planned—and related infrastructure at its plant in Sunderland, UK.
When finalized, Nissan's EV36Zero hub in Sunderland will produce three electric vehicles and battery cells for them at three gigafactories.
Of the total investment, up to 1.12 billion pounds ($1.41 billion) will be allocated for R&D and manufacturing of the electric Juke and Qashqai announced today. The sum includes facility and manufacturing process improvements, skills training, and tooling for suppliers.
This will be in addition to the 423 million pound ($531 million) investment in the first phase of EV36Zero for the first future EV, the successor to the Leaf entry-level EV. The new model will enter production in Sunderland in 2026.
Interestingly, Nissan said the newly confirmed future EVs to be built in Sunderland will take inspiration from its recently unveiled concept cars.
The Nissan Hyper Urban Concept will influence the design of the future Qashqai EV, while the Hyper Punk Concept will shape the Juke EV. It was already known that the Chill-Out Concept from 2021 would provide inspiration for the next Leaf.
The automaker said it will offer more information about the three upcoming EVs, including names, specifications and launch dates, at a later time.
""Exciting, electric vehicles are at the heart of our plans to achieve carbon neutrality. With electric versions of our core European models on the way, we are accelerating towards a new era for Nissan, for industry and for our customers,"" said Nissan President and CEO, Makoto Uchida.
""The EV36Zero project puts our Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest ever car factory, at the heart of our future vision. It means our UK team will be designing, engineering and manufacturing the vehicles of the future, driving us towards an all-electric future for Nissan in Europe.""
Nissan said the electricity needed to power the production of EVs and batteries in Sunderland will be supplied by the EV36Zero Microgrid, which produces 100% renewable electricity from the company's wind and solar farms—including a brand-new 20MW solar farm.
Nissan previously confirmed that all its new cars in Europe from now will be fully electric. By 2030, the automaker expects its passenger car lineup in Europe to become 100% electric.

"VinFast VF7 Compact Crossover Starts At $35,000 In Vietnam",https://insideevs.com/news/697417/vinfast-vf7-vietnam-launch-price-specs/,How will the price change when it makes it to the U.S.?,2023-11-22 09:29:18,"VinFast, the Vietnamese automaker that currently sells the VF8 and VF9 all-electric crossovers in the United States, has officially launched the smaller VF7 in its home market in Vietnam.
Set to make its way in the United States at some point in the future, the new VinFast VF7 starts at around $35,000 (VND850 million) in the Southeast Asian country, but that’s without owning the high-voltage battery that powers the car. With the battery pack included, the starting price rises to about $41,000 (VND999 million) for the base trim.
For those who want a lower purchase price, there’s the option of leasing the battery pack for approximately $120 (VND2.9 million) per month, which is good for a maximum of 1,864 miles (3,000 kilometers). If an owner drives over the limit, the monthly fee goes up to roughly $198 (VND4.8 million). Customers who want to benefit from the lease deal will also have to cough up a $1,695 deposit (VND41 million), which will be refunded when the contract ends, the battery is returned, or when the vehicle and battery are transferred to another owner.
Currently, the Vietnamese carmaker doesn’t offer a battery lease deal in the United States, and we don’t know if it will ever do, but we do know that the specs are slightly different between the Vietnamese market and U.S.-bound VF7.
In Vietnam, the compact crossover EV will be offered in two trim levels–Base and Plus–while the American market specs revealed at the beginning of the year say the VF7 will come in either Eco or Plus variants.
In its home market, the VF7 Base is set in motion by a single electric motor making 174 horsepower (130 kilowatts) that draws power from a 59.6-kilowatt-hour battery. With it, the EV can travel up to 233 miles on the WLTP test.
The U.S.-spec VF7 Eco, on the other hand, will reportedly have a slightly more gutsy single motor that sends 201 hp (150 kW) to the front wheels and is energized by a larger, 75.3-kWh battery, the same as on the Plus version, which offers the same specs in both markets.
The top trim gets a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup that’s good for a combined 348 hp (260 kW), while the bigger battery enables a WLTP-estimated driving range of 268 miles on a full charge.
VinFast didn’t say how fast the VF7 can be recharged, but it did say that all models come with 11 basic driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. There’s also a virtual assistant that can answer questions in Vietnamese and in-car voice control.
Penned by Italian designer Torino Design. the new electric crossover benefits from a 10-year or 125,000-mile warranty, whichever comes first, while the battery is covered under a 10-year warranty with no mileage limit. It measures 178.9 in (4,545 millimeters) long and 74.4 in (1,890 mm) wide and has a wheelbase of 111.8 in (2,840 mm).
Customers will be able to reserve a VF7 in Vietnam from December 2 with a non-refundable deposit of approximately $2,000 (VND30 million). Deliveries are expected to begin in early 2024.
We reached out to VinFast to know when the VF7 will make its way to the United States and will update this article when we hear back. But until that happens, let us know what you think in the comments section below: would this electric crossover be a good deal if it starts at around $40,000 in the U.S.?

"China's Latest Electric Super Sedan Looks Outlandish And Has 1,287 HP",https://www.motor1.com/news/696367/hiphi-a-electric-hypercar-debut/,The awkwardly named HiPhi A was developed in cooperation with Apollo Automobil.,2024-12-25 09:06:27,"Another day, another new electric vehicle from China. This time around we have a rather special model as it promises a sprint to 60 mph in just over two seconds. We’ll get to other numbers in a minute but first, say hello to the new HiPhi A.
For the uninitiated, HiPhi is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer focused on developing and producing luxury and performance cars. The new HiPhi A is based on the Z and no, we aren't talking about the Nissan Z. The company unveiled a chunky electric liftback sedan with 600 horsepower back in March, and well, things have escalated since then. The automaker promises we won’t be dealing only with renderings, either – an actual car will be displayed at the upcoming 2023 Guangzhou Auto Show starting Friday. The first customer deliveries are scheduled for early 2025.
Whereas the Z has a dual-motor electric powertrain, the A is powered by three electric motors. You'll find one on the front axle and two at the back, one for each rear wheel. This is an in-house developed system, which has a peak output of 1,287 hp. The electric energy comes from a battery pack with an as-yet undisclosed capacity that should be capable of discharging up to 1,500 kilowatts at its peak. The powertrain is based on an 800-volt electric architecture – also an in-house development for the company – promising to maintain its peak output for more than 30 minutes. As a result, the top speed of the EV is listed at 186 miles per hour.
From China With Love:
An air suspension system shared with the HiPhi Z is standard, but the A model upgrades that with a rear-steering setup, adaptive dampers, and a new torque-vectoring system. The company also says the electric performance vehicle has a perfect 50:50 weight distribution. HiPhi partnered with Apollo Automobil, the company behind the Intensa Emozione and G2J electric supercars, to bring this new model to life
HiPhi promises to unveil more details in the coming months. We are eager to see whether the new A will be sold in markets outside China as the company already has showrooms in Germany and Norway. Don't get your hopes up for a US launch, though.

2025 Cadillac Optiq Electric Luxury Compact SUV Is The Brand's Entry EV,https://insideevs.com/news/696372/cadillac-optiq-electric-luxury-compact-suv-is-brand-entry-ev/,"Slotting below the Lyriq, the Optiq will be the entry point for Cadillac's EV lineup in North America.",2023-11-17 09:00:00,"Say hello to the 2025 Cadillac Optiq, the automaker's latest all-electric model after the Lyriq, Celestiq, and Escalade IQ.
Described as a luxury compact SUV, the Cadillac Optiq will slot below the Lyriq and will act as the entry-level model for the brand's EV lineup in North America.
Cadillac hasn't said much else about its new EV other than the fact its ""spirited driving dynamics are designed to appeal to global luxury customers."" The automaker noted that additional details, features, and pricing will be unveiled next year.
The two images released by Cadillac reveal the exterior design of the Optiq in the Sport trim level, and the fact it's labeled a 2025 model suggests it will launch sometime in 2024. It remains to be seen if GM will be able to pull that off given the difficulties it has when it comes to ramping up production of the Lyriq.
From a styling standpoint, the Optiq looks quite similar to the Lyriq, sharing the same design language with the larger electric crossover. However, it gets different details such as smaller upper and lower grilles, different headlights and taillights, a unique C-pillar treatment, and more.
If you feel like you've seen the Optiq before, your memory does not fail you. The vehicle's design was first uncovered in China in August by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The U.S.-spec Cadillac Optiq looks identical with the China-spec model, but we're not so sure if the powertrain specifications will be the same.
In China, the Cadillac Optiq will be available with either single- or dual-motor Ultium Drive powertrains and Ultium batteries. There will be two rear-drive powertrains with 201 horsepower (150 kilowatts) or 241 hp (180 kW), and an all-wheel-drive powertrain making 283 hp (211 kW) and 343 pound-feet of torque.

Built on a variant of GM's BEV3 platform shared with the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Buick Electra E5, and Buick Electra E4, the Cadillac Optiq is not that much smaller than the Lyriq.
It's 189.8 inches long, 75.3 inches wide, and 64.7 inches high, while its 116.3-inch wheelbase is exactly the same as that of the Equinox EV, Electra E5, and Electra E4. For comparison, the Cadillac Lyriq is 196.7 inches long, 77.8 inches wide, and 63.9 inches high, with a wheelbase of 121.8 inches.
Expect the 2025 Cadillac Optiq to be more affordable than the 2024 Cadillac Lyriq, which starts at $58,590 (including destination). Exactly how much cheaper the Optiq will be is anyone's guess, but don't get your hopes up too high as even the 210-hp Chevy Equinox 2RS FWD launch model is priced from $48,995 – and the Optiq is a more upscale model.",Dan Mihalascu
