'Get Butts In Seats': Inside Dodge's Plan To Convert EV Skeptics,https://insideevs.com/news/745071/dodge-charger-ev-skeptics-roadkill/,"To win over the Mopar faithful, Dodge is about to lean on them actually experiencing the electric Charger Daytona.",2024-12-19 17:00:00,"Dodge, perhaps alone among contemporary automakers, has seen immense success in translating the archaic 20th-century Muscle Car formula into the 21st. It has done this by stuffing increasingly outrageous iterations of its modern Hemi V8 into nearly every vehicle in its product line. Its fervent Hellcat-ing has been enough, surprisingly, to maintain steadily vigorous sales of its Challenger coupe and Charger sedan, 20-year-old cars aping 55-year-old designs and riding on platforms developed more than 30 years ago.
But those vehicles are finally going away. They will be replaced by flexible-powertrain two- and four-door models, both called Charger, that will be motivated, at launch in early 2025, solely by a 100.5 kWh battery pack and a pair of electric motors. (And if you’re a Mopar nut but are committed to internal combustion, your muscle-car future means an inline-six engine, as if you were one of those guys whose entire wardrobe consists of ///M apparel. Can you imagine?) So how does Mopar’s methylized muscle-maker plan to convince potential consumers to buy into such a blasphemous switcheroo?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To get enthusiasts’ “butts-in-seats” and assist with this electron baptism, Dodge is planning a whole series of events in the upcoming year, said Matt McAlear, the brand’s CEO. It will take its new EV muscle cars on tour in the first quarter of 2025 to train its sales and dealership staff and demonstrate the vehicles’ capabilities. It is launching a courtesy transportation program wherein it will send EVs to dealers to use for short-term consumer test drives, or as 96-hour loaners when customers come in to have their vehicle serviced. It will host consumer-facing “Thrill Ride” drive events at upcoming Mecum and Barrett-Jackson classic car auctions, and at its drifting/drag racing “Roadkill Nights” live events in the summer–—prime sites for the gathering of Hemis of all vintages.
“Dodge is always best as a brand when it does something different,” McAlear said, referencing the automaker’s marketing slogan from the 1980s and 1990s, Dodge Different. And he’s certainly right about convincing people with actual seat time and not just ads. Study after study indicates that once people experience EVs for themselves, or hear from friends and family who do, they’re far more likely to pull the trigger themselves.
Plus, he said, this EV has the bona fides. “This vehicle, it's a muscle car first. If you look at the specs, the design, the capability, and take powertrain out of it, it’s a better muscle car on paper than the cars it replaces,” he noted. “So while there is a polarizing, controversial aspect to this—that it happens to have an EV powertrain as one of the powertrains that’s going to power it—no one can argue the battery electric technology enables terrific performance, and that's what we're bringing to market with this.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
To enunciate this point, McAlear pointed out that even after Dodge introduces ICE-powered iterations of the Charger in the second half of 2025, gasoline power will represent “the entry-level vehicles from a performance standpoint.” So if a potential consumer desires a car with the quickest acceleration (0-60 in 3.3 seconds) they’ll learn that that capability is a battery-only option.
This powertrain rollout and hierarchy is a stated part of Dodge’s strategy for muscling the muscle car faithful toward EVs, according to McAlear. Another prong in this program is to focus on added utility and daily drivability, to create what Stellantis design chief Ralph Gilles called “emotional alibis” to lead consumers toward acceptance of this new product.
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear listed a suite of capabilities that can provide such cover for what amounts to a highly irrational and emotional purchase. “All-wheel-drive, for instance, helps us compete more in the North as a daily driver,” he said, referencing its all-weather capability. “A hidden hatchback capability gives you amazing cargo space that you didn’t have in your old vehicle. The new Charger two-door now has more rear-seat legroom than the outgoing four-door,” he said. “So this becomes much more of a daily driver than any of the muscle cars that we've had prior.”
Will this litany of added functionality convince Dodge die-hards, who will receive a defeatable synthetic exhaust note that is as boisterous as that of the outgoing car, but no scent of unburned fuel or ability to smoke the rear tires from a standstill?
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
“Probably not immediately out of the gate,” McAlear said. “It's going to take some time. It's going to take them seeing one on the street. It's going to take them going in for service and testing one while they're getting an oil change. But I've seen those people get behind the wheel and come out with changed opinions.”
However, convincing the faithful may not be the ideal tactic for furthering this car’s market penetration. “Though a muscle car and an electric vehicle seem diametrically opposed, there is an opportunity for electrification to magnify the idea, benefits, and aspirational nature of the muscle car,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a Southern California automotive research and consulting firm. “However, the conversion of those from the past, I do not believe is the best strategy. Instead, a new generation of muscle cars can find success with younger folks who think they like muscle cars.”
As it turns out, Dodge has just such consumers in its targets. “If you look at our current demographic today, we have the youngest demographic in the mainstream auto industry,” said McAlear. “We have the highest percentage of Gen Z and Millennials. And those customers have the highest propensity to be willing to adopt electrification. So that sets us up.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Dodge might be onto something here. Though muscle car seems like an anachronistic category to anyone who isn’t a Boomer, research shows that these vehicles have and maintain broader appeal. “The interesting thing with those cars, I think, is they’re far more long-lived than cars like tri-five [1955-57] Chevys, or other American cars of the era,” said Brian Rabold, vice president of valuation for Hagerty, the world’s largest insurer of collectible vehicles. “There are a lot more entry points for younger generations to become interested in them—through driving video games, through movies like the Fast and Furious franchise.” As Rabold notes, pop cultural exposure conjures interest and desire, and translates into purchases, whether those be old Polaras and Road Runners, or more recent Fox Body Mustangs and fourth-gen Firebirds.
Still, rumors have persisted that interest in Dodge’s new muscular EV is less robust than the brand initially suspected and that it is thus rushing the inline-six-powered iterations to supplement this engagement. McAlear denies this categorically.
“That's what you call an urban legend,” he said. “Someone put one thing on the Internet. And if it's on the Internet, it's true, right?” He laughed, underlining his sarcasm. “We're always trying to bring every new vehicle to market as quickly as possible,” he continued. “It doesn't do us any good from an R&D and a capital expenditure standpoint to hold sales any longer than we have to. So nothing has changed with our timing.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
Overall, once both powertrains are on the market, McAlear expects the mix of Charger buyers to segment about evenly: half electric, half gas. This aligns with Dodge’s current mix of high-test Hemi- versus lesser-powered Challengers and Chargers. “If we look historically at our V6 versus our performance V8, it was roughly 50/50,” McAlear said. “So I still think there's an opportunity, over time—as adoption continues to happen, and as infrastructure comes in across the U.S. in terms of charging capability—I think there's the ability for this [EV] to beat a 50/50 mix.” (Dodge officials declined to address questions about demand or pre-orders, but said they plan to remain flexible in terms of production based on consumer demand.)
If any marque is positioned to succeed with an electric muscle car, it seems to be Mopar’s performance brand. “Consumers who own the Charger and Challenger usually love their vehicles,” said Edwards, whose firm conducts hundreds of thousands of in-depth psychographic surveys with new car buyers annually. “Even those who never buy a Dodge can often agree that Dodge is an exciting brand that has a lot to offer. If Dodge takes the position that they are innovating excitement, then this next step could be a doorway for Dodge’s electric future.” He added one further provision. “They just have to get the messaging right.”
2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV
McAlear and his teams seem to be thinking about this carefully, calibrating their messaging to entice purchasers who may be simultaneously powertrain-aware and -agnostic. “People buy a muscle car for so much more than just what powers it. They buy it because of how it makes them feel. It's an extension of their personality. It puts a smile on their face. They have fun being in it. They have fun being seen it,” he said. “So I think that's what this vehicle does. And it opens this up to a much larger demographic and audience.”
After spending some time in the Daytona Charger EV, recently, I felt like it succeeded in charting a freshly charged path into the moribund world of muscle cars. So Dodge seemingly has the product right. And it has a history of creating memorable messaging.
We’ll see if it can find a magic recipe that yields results from a youthful audience open to this surprisingly compelling and venerable category.

"Tavares: China Is 'Many Years' Ahead With EVs, Says EU Politicians Created 'Dead End'",https://www.motor1.com/news/744740/tavares-resignation-amicable-blames-eu-politicians/,"The Ex-Stellantis CEO believes China is years ahead when it comes to EVs, hence his push for company goals many said were unrealistic.",2024-12-25 07:27:49,"Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares isn't backing down from the decisions that led to his resignation. In his first interview since voluntarily exiting the company, he effectively double-downed on his stance that conflicted with the Stellantis board members. At the same time, he voiced concerns that China was far ahead in the electric fold, essentially forcing European brands into survival mode.
Speaking with Portuguese news outlet Expresso, the ex-executive emphasized the importance of having a strong, singular vision and admitted his plan didn't mesh with the board.
""A company that has 250,000 employees and 15 brands cannot be managed with a lack of alignment,” said Tavares, according to Expresso. That was the catalyst for his resignation, which Tavares described as an ""amicable"" joint decision between him and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann. And it seems he has no regrets, as Wards Auto reports he would make the same calls if it all came about again.
His views on China likely have something to do with that. In the interview, Tavares likened the current situation to something of a Darwinian challenge for European automakers, where only the strongest will survive. He reportedly said China was ""many years"" ahead with its EV development and as a result, it created a ""dead end that was created exclusively by European political leaders.""
Meanwhile in the United States, Elkann is already talking with disgruntled Stellantis dealers on how to go forward. The US Stellantis National Dealer Council blasted Tavares for making poor short-term decisions to generate quick global profits at the expense of long-term health for Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, the US side of Stellantis. Sales for Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler are down through 2024; dealers say Stellantis priced its newer offerings above the market for its customer base. And there's also the demise of the popular Hemi V-8, something apparently only Tavares wanted.
Following his sudden resignation on December 1, former Dodge and Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis was rehired to lead Ram. As for a new Stellantis CEO, that decision will be made in the first half of 2025.

The Lucid Gravity Is Here. Now Comes The Hard Part.,https://insideevs.com/news/744393/lucid-gravity-production-eric-bach/,We talked to Lucid chief engineer Eric Bach about the start of Gravity production and what comes next.,2024-12-14 12:00:00,"Sleek, futuristic Lucid Gravity SUVs started trickling off the production line at the startup automaker's Arizona factory last week after years of development and some delays. Lucid Motors hopes its second-ever model will ignite sales like never before and pave the way for long-term financial health. But it has a hill to climb before any of that can happen.
Soon, Lucid will have to start churning out more vehicles more quickly than it’s ever had to before. That ramp-up process has proven fraught for new automakers, like Tesla. And that’s only half the battle. There’s not even a guarantee that buyers will line up in droves, given Lucid’s prior challenges with brand awareness.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
The launch of the Gravity is a make-or-break moment for Lucid, which has yet to turn a profit and has relied on billions in infusions from its majority shareholder, the Saudi Public Investment Fund. It’s the SUV that will drive revenue until Lucid’s true mainstream EV hits the road later this decade. The arrival of “Project Midsize,” a roughly $50,000 crossover, will mark Lucid’s Tesla Model Y moment—when it can hopefully hit the scale needed to reliably earn more than it spends.
Until then, the Gravity needs to be a hit. And that starts with ramping up production from a few units to thousands and then tens of thousands—no small feat.
“The key is to bring all the elements and areas together at the same time, at the right quality,” Eric Bach, Lucid’s chief engineer, told InsideEVs in a recent interview. “And that is what a ramp is about.”
Here are those elements, according to Bach. First off, you need a product that’s mature and durable and won’t result in endless warranty repairs once it starts going out to customers. You also need a supply base that’s dialed in and can ramp up production alongside the main assembly plant.
Lucid Gravity and Lucid Chief Engineer Eric Bach
The third leg of the stool is a competent factory and logistics system. Bach says ramping up production is stressful for any car company, but he believes Lucid is ready for it.
“The second ramp is always better than and easier than the first ramp because we've built more capabilities. I'm not afraid of the ramp at all,” he said. “Surely, there will be some hiccups and pain, but that's normal.”
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Lucid ran up against all manner of supply-chain and manufacturing issues when it started producing the Air sedan, its first and so far only model, at scale in 2022. But it’s far from alone there.
Famously, Tesla nearly went bankrupt during early Model 3 production in 2017 and 2018, a period Tesla CEO Elon Musk called ""production hell."" Even well-oiled automakers that have been doing this for a century have hit snags in manufacturing new electric models. General Motors spent months solving battery-production bottlenecks as it launched its new EVs like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq last year.
Lucid is focused on ramping up the Gravity with high quality, Bach said, echoing Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson’s comments on a recent earnings call. Although production has begun, Lucid hasn’t said when customer deliveries will start.
“I anticipate that we're going to be manufacturing-constrained next year in the buildup of Gravity,” he said in early November. “We need to get the quality right and take a judicious and very prudent approach to meeting customer expectations with the quality as we ramp up.”
As production gets underway, Bach’s team is hammering away on future over-the-air updates for the Gravity. And it’s working on homologating the SUV for global markets. It’s also been conducting testing with Tesla Superchargers, seeing as the Gravity will ship from the factory with Tesla’s previously exclusive charging port design. (It’s one of the first such models since the entire auto industry announced it would migrate to Tesla’s plug.)
Lucid hasn’t officially announced access to Tesla’s charging network for its owners, but Bach says that will happen in advance of the first Gravity deliveries.
The other big challenge facing Lucid here, and Rawlinson referred to it on that same earnings call, concerns demand and brand awareness. The startup sold just 6,001 Air sedans in 2023, and it’s projecting production of 9,000 vehicles this year. That’s a far cry from where it had expected to be by this point.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
In 2021, Lucid predicted that it would make 90,000 vehicles in 2024, including 41,000 Airs and 49,000 Gravity SUVs. That was based on the Gravity starting production in 2023, which it didn’t. So that delay accounts for about half the shortfall. On top of that, lots of people simply don’t know what a Lucid is or that they should even consider buying one.
“I’ve stated before that we’re not manufacturing-constrained,” Rawlinson said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “We’ve been market-constrained.”
Rawlinson said that Lucid’s brand awareness has been improving and that the Gravity should benefit from that momentum. Plus, the brand is planning an advertising blitz and more brick-and-mortar locations as part of the Gravity’s launch.
The 2025 Lucid Gravity
Bach is convinced that the Gravity itself will do wonders for the Lucid brand.
Sedans like the Air don't sell in large numbers anymore, which has held Lucid back. It’s a shame, in a way, because the Air is one of the best—if not the best—electric vehicles you can buy in America today. The Gravity, a seven-seat SUV, should unlock six times the addressable market of the Air and get Lucid on a lot more radars, Bach said. Then word-of-mouth can take over.
“I'm very positive that a better product is always the key starting point” for building a brand, he said.
On paper, the Gravity is indeed a mind-blowing vehicle. The Grand Touring model, the first to launch, will offer a whopping 450 miles of EPA-rated range, over 800 horsepower and over 900 pound-feet of torque. It’s pretty extraordinary in person as well, as I learned during a test drive in Malibu, California this month.
The thing looks like nothing else on the road, drives better than any hulking SUV should, offers a dazzling digital interface and has as much room inside as your average New York City apartment.
A teaser of Lucid's upcoming midsize crossover.
It has the potential to be a slam dunk. But it’s yet to be seen whether people will embrace that oddball, minivan-like shape. And then there’s the price; the Gravity Grand Touring starts at $94,900, more than tried-and-true gas-powered rivals like the BMW X7 or Volvo XC90. A $79,900 Touring model should arrive sometime next year.
There’s a lot riding on the Gravity. But Lucid is also steaming toward its next project, a smaller, more affordable family of vehicles expected to start production in 2026. About half of Bach’s team is working on that, he said.
“It never stops in my role,” Bach said.

"Why We Got Our Tesla Cybertruck Testers From Turo, Not Tesla",https://insideevs.com/news/744232/tesla-cybertruck-press-cars/,Tesla doesn't operate like other automakers. That makes testing one a bit more complicated.,2024-12-12 14:00:15,"There's a weird relationship at the heart of car reviews. Dealers largely won't let us drive cars for more than an hour, and that's not enough for a review. We'd love to buy every car we drive, but anyone suggesting that's possible doesn't really understand the economics of the modern digital media business. That means we have to turn to manufacturer-provided loaners, a compromise we aim to consistently note via our ""Full Disclosure"" section of the review. Yet that strategy doesn't work for Tesla.
The company does everything differently. While other automakers have press teams to handle inquiries from the media and, in most cases, provide loaners, Tesla merely provides a generic press@Tesla.com email address. It's effectively a wishing well. You throw questions and requests in, and nothing comes out.
The Breakthrough Awards
Tesla used to do this, back in the 2010s. Certain members of the current InsideEVs team got access to cars like the Model S and Model 3 when they were brand-new, writing for other outlets. But since CEO Elon Musk dissolved the Tesla press team, that's a no-go for us.
Now, Tesla does seem to loan some cars to so-called influencers, certain large magazines and outlets in Europe; its press team allowed us a new Model 3 for review in Europe because the company still interfaces with journalists over there. But here in the U.S., it's radio silence for all communications with the media: requests for comment, press releases, updates on new products and, yes, cars to test.
Some Tesla fans may see this as a victory over companies that are too buddy-buddy with the press. I get it. If you're trying to be ethical in this business, this sort of thing is a minefield and it's often abused.
The conflicts regarding reviewing a product you get for free are substantial, and I devote large parts of my efforts here to making sure we remain fair and free of outside influence on our reviews. I hope that comes through. I'm proud of the fact that our reviews are harsh when necessary, glowing when appropriate and always honest representations of what the author actually thinks. We don't pull punches.
The last thing I want to do is come off as entitled by complaining that a certain company won't give us free cars to test, either. But as an InsideEVs reader, you should know this makes it difficult to learn anything about what Tesla is doing. If we want to try out the latest software, or version of Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, or see what the updates to the Model 3 Highland and upcoming Model Y Juniper are like, we're basically out of luck. That can make the largest EV manufacturer in the world a kind of black box more often than we'd like.
Tesla's approach, unfortunately, guarantees that no one can do the sort of in-depth reporting that we do on other automakers. If we have a technical question about an engineering decision, a factual question about company policies or a genuine curiosity about something new, we can go kick rocks. Tesla isn't picking up the phone.
That makes it nigh-impossible to combat misinformation about the company—which abounds—as the one source that could refute a claim will never engage. When the company does communicate with the public, it does so through Elon Musk's X account, which often bears no resemblance to the truth (and unlike in the 2010s, has very little to do with Tesla these days.)
Lately, what we've seen is that the few people who are allowed to talk to Tesla executives or review their products with company demo cars, are sometimes the most fawning, hand-selected ""critics"" Tesla knows.
InsideEVs doesn't make that list. That means that if we want to experience the cars, we have to get them ourselves. Fair play.
The company doesn't owe us test cars; frankly, none do. But Tesla forces us to treat its products differently from others, so I wanted to lay out my thinking on the issue. If you think there's a better way, don't shy away from telling me. My email is below.
The first option is to borrow a car from readers. That is the fairest option on paper, as it doesn't require us to take discounts or rentals from other companies. But there's another moral tie-up there. I like our readers. I love the many, many readers who have volunteered to give us time in their cars, at no cost and with no strings attached. You are all so kind, and so well-intentioned. That there is the problem.
Because what happens, then, if I hate your car? If you're a Cybertruck owner who gives us a car out of the kindness of your heart, it'll be pretty hard for me to say the Cybertruck is a car you mostly buy for attention, even if I think that's true. Though there's no direct financial relationship there, there's an emotional one.
Plus, the liability of driving a private owner's car on company business is a nightmare. Most importantly, we can't really bother a reader's personal car for a week, and if we only drive for an hour it's hard to tell you anything you can't learn in a test drive.
We tested Cybertrucks all over the country for our Breakthrough Awards this year.
So there's one option if we want to spend a few days with a specific model. We use Turo. For the unfamiliar, Turo allows you to rent cars from private owners (and small businesses that use the site), and its key selling point is the ability to rent a specific car. So instead of getting a ""Chrysler Pacifica or similar"" that turns out to be a Mitsubishi Mirage, we can rent a specific Cyberbeast or Model S Plaid. And we pay for this ourselves.
It's the best solution, one that allows me to criticize a car freely while still providing something to the owner to make it worth their time. The one issue is that owners set the price, and for a hot new product like the Cybertruck loans can be expensive. When I drove one back in February, it was about $1,000 per day, plus extras. Then we have to insure it, and multiply that out by the six Breakthrough Awards judges we had and... oh my. This is why—full disclosure—we also work with Turo to get a discount in certain cases, particularly for bigger projects like this. Because of that, we also mention that we get the cars on Turo. I hope that's an acceptable compromise.
We're free to criticize the cars as needed, to drive them hundreds of miles and get real-world experience in them. The owner gets paid, Turo gets some publicity and Tesla doesn't have to lift a finger. I think it's a win-win-win for us, the readers and Turo, but I'm open to other suggestions.
And if you have any personal complaints about me, feel free to send them to press@Tesla.com. I'm sure someone will read them eventually.

Dodge Says The Charger EV Will Save The Planet From 'Self-Driving Sleep Pods',https://www.motor1.com/news/743108/dodge-charger-ev-save-planet/,"We won't know until the Charger Daytona goes on sale, which still hasn't happened.",2024-12-25 07:27:51,"Dodge wants to make sure you understand the new electric Charger isn't like other EVs. The newly revamped fastback will save the world from ""soulless, self-driving sleep pods everyone else keeps polluting the streets with,"" according to the company in a recent social media campaign.
Dodge proclaims the Charger Daytona—with 670 combined horsepower from a dual-motor powertrain—is the world's most powerful muscle car. Somehow, it seems Dodge isn't being sarcastic about any of this.
There are certainly many dual-motor EVs making more than 670 ponies. Whether those vehicles meet the definition of a muscle car, that's a debate we'll leave to you fine readers in the comments below. That said, we get what Dodge is doing here. At the Charger Daytona debut earlier this year, former Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis was keen to point out the Charger EV's mission wasn't to offer an environmentally friendly performance vehicle. With the optional Scat Pack (required to reach the aforementioned 670 hp), range is only 260 miles. And then there's the sound, which was revised numerous times before settling on a classic V-8 rumble.
Will buyers buy into the Charger Daytona as an electric muscle car saving us all from ""soulless"" EVs? If social media comments on any Charger Daytona post are an indication, it'll be a tough sell. And we suspect Dodge feels the same way, because the combustion-powered Charger Sixpack—originally slated to go on sale in late 2025—has allegedly been fast-tracked to arrive in early summer. But it's unclear how that model will be received since the Hemi V-8 is officially dead. It will use the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, making either 420 or 550 hp.
In the meantime, Dodge is running through the last of its outgoing Charger models. Sales, predictably, are way down as the transition takes place, made worse by the electric Charger Daytona not being available as we enter the final month of 2024. It was originally scheduled to go on sale last summer.
Saving the world, it seems, will be a project for next year.

Jaguar’s Electric Comeback Is Big And Bold. But Time Is Running Out,https://insideevs.com/news/742967/jaguar-type-00-business/,"The Jaguar Type 00 Concept is a $120,000 bold bet on EV power, but this brand is already on its ninth life. Can it pull off a comeback?",2024-12-02 20:10:00,"Jaguar’s title sponsorship of Miami Art Week featured its own blank canvas in the Type 00, a concept car the brand hopes will spawn some electric masterpieces beginning in 2026. Its design is remarkably striking, easily the most interesting thing Jaguar has done in years.
But design is one thing; making a business out of it is another, and Jaguar is running out of time.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The Miami venue underscored the brand’s intention to collaborate with artists, who aren’t known for buying roughly $120,000 EVs; but also to market to wealthy coastal types who might. Forget the gray U.K. or a gritty Detroit in January—that’s so 1960s. Forget British punters crying in their Guinness over classic E-Types. They’re ambivalent at best toward EVs, and probably can’t afford these cars anyway. JLR estimates only 10 to 15% of current customers will come along for the ride.
That brings us to the first of Jaguar’s problems and possibly the ninth of its lives: lately, Jaguar hasn’t had many customers at all. The brand sold 8,348 cars in America in 2023, down nearly 80 percent since 2017, and about 64,000 worldwide. Mercedes and BMW each sold about 40 times that many cars in the U.S. Its current lineup, if you can even call it that, is just holdovers from the previous decade like the once-groundbreaking but now irrelevant electric I-Pace.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
As company executives note, that has proven the folly of butting heads with BMW, Benz or even Genesis in the mass-luxury ranks. Blame whatever you like, a dodgy quality reputation, anodyne designs, a revolving door of ownership and strategies. That includes balling and tossing a near-completed electric XJ design, and $634 million with it.
These are valid diagnoses of an ailing brand. But I prefer a swipe with Occam’s Razor: Jaguar is a sedan and sports-car specialist in a world that has turned its back on sedans and sports cars. And Range Rover has the SUV-heritage-thing wrapped up, leaving scraps for its starveling sister.
Jaguar’s good old days are over, and its internal-combustion ways weren’t working. So the brand will shutter its factories, pretend 2025 isn’t a thing, and start fresh in 2026. Type 00 might refer to the revenues Jaguar will generate between now and then.
More seriously, U.S. dealers, their count already reduced to 120, will spend at least 12 months unloading a staggered inventory of leftovers, including the excellent but oft-overlooked F-Pace SUV. You think you’re peeved about Jaguar’s reimagining? I’m sure those long-suffering franchisees love to hear Jaguar tout posh new in-house stores to offer “immersive steps into the world of the Jaguar brand.” This red-hot industry trend, whose failures include a now-shuttered Cadillac House in Manhattan, has shown little to no evidence of boosting sales or brand image.
But at its Gaydon design studios, where I saw the Type 00 prior to the Miami reveal, Jaguar showed a rendering of a future store design: More shelter-magazine fantasy than traditional dealership, complete with a dramatic spiral staircase. Jaguar plans to open the first of these brand showcases in Paris’ “Golden Triangle” luxury-fashion district in the 8th arrondissement.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
The question lingers: How many Parisians, Persians or Philadelphians will spend six figures on an electric Jaguar? As Rawdon Glover, managing director, confirmed in an interview, the brand plans to boost average transaction prices from today’s $60,000 to roughly $120,000.
Considering today’s option-stuffed luxury models, that to me suggests base prices closer to $100,000, which I believe Jaguar had better be targeting through ruthlessly disciplined design, supplier deals, and resource sharing. Much higher than that, and the air gets thin and customers are finicky and scarce—especially for an underdog like Jaguar.
Plot an industry sales chart based on prices, and you’ll be struck by how new-car sales tumble off a cliff above $100,000. That surprisingly small niche of buyers tends to head straight to blue-chip ICE perennials, your Porsche 911s, Mercedes G-Classes and S-Classes, a few BMWs. Oh, and Range Rovers.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Normally, if people don’t want your $60,000 cars, shooting for $120,000 sounds like madness. But these aren’t normal times. Like many legacy brands, Jaguar rightly sees its current fossil-fueled path as a dead-end. If you’re going to go down, you might as well go down swinging, with three chances to hit a home run or even a bloop single. The strategy appears simultaneously desperate, smart and necessary. The entire industry, including mainstream GM and Ford, has figured out it’s better to build fewer cars and charge much more for them, rather than go broke chasing volume and market share.
So Jaguar will aim for just 50,000 global sales, a fraction of the roughly 130,000 it sold under Ford’s high-volume auspices in 2002. Glover believes Jaguar can make money at those volumes, and finally carry its weight within JLR.
If Jaguar has a trump card, it’s Gerry McGovern, and his status as likely the industry’s most successful contemporary luxury designer and turnaround artist. McGovern basically hit reset on Land Rover after its own years in the wilderness. When you see people routinely paying $200,000 and more for top Range Rovers; and their sleek convoys on shows like Succession that have become a stereotypical visual shorthand for wealth and power, you can thank McGovern. Now running the entire JLR design show from a tastefully curated office in Gaydon, McGovern won’t be getting his hands dirty with Jaguar clay models, but nothing will reach showrooms without his signoff. And considering McGovern’s track record, I’m not ready to bet against him.
For all that, Jaguar may still be leaping from frying pan to fire.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
I can’t shake a suspicion that Jaguar is trying to locate an imaginary slice of the market where competition doesn’t exist, or will curl up in a ball when faced with Jaguar’s (purportedly) superior designs. When I asked Glover to name the brands or models Jaguar was benchmarking or viewed as rivals, he demurred; saying Jaguar had often spent too much time worrying about the competition and was better off playing its own confident game. Fair enough.
Yet at Gaydon, Glover and other execs took plenty of broad shots at today’s luxury EVs as being generic, cab-forward transportation pods, designed to satisfy wind tunnels rather than discerning eyes. (I’d say “Looking at you, Mercedes,” but I’m not telling them anything they don’t already know.)
In contrast, Jaguar’s distinctive, design-led models would stand out and carry the day. But even recently, Jaguar often boasted the sexiest cars in various segments—the XJ sedan, the F-Type sports car and F-Pace SUV—and a fat lot of good it did them. Jaguar needs to bring the performance, tech, quality, everything, and not just show up at the party with the sharpest suit and prettiest bouquet.
If Jaguar won’t breathe a few Voldemort names, I will: Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lucid to start. All of those brands, I humbly submit, have managed distinctive EV designs of their own. Then there’s Tesla, which will flip you a Model S Plaid for $89,900. The Tesla may not be as swanky as a future Jaguar, but it’s got 1,020 horsepower, will cost roughly $30,000 less.
And there are signs that the uber-wealthy would rather pay for the privilege of internal combustion.
Global sales of the Porsche Taycan, a benchmark luxury EV, have tumbled a whopping 50% in 2024, though the heavily updated 2025 models aren’t out in force yet. Mercedes’ EQS sedan, with base prices ranging from about $105,000 to $129,000, has failed to win over traditional Mercedes ICE customers or conquest new ones. Despite stellar performance and industry-leading range and efficiency, Lucid’s Air has not done what the Model S did for Tesla. If Porsche, Mercedes and Lucid are struggling in the EV stratosphere, what chance does Jaguar have?
Other nagging questions include the brand’s ability to make money with a standalone Jaguar Electric Architecture. Can Jaguar sell enough cars and share enough components with Range Rover to balance the books and justify that investment?
Jaguar is also failing to take a lesson from Lucid’s gravest mistake, which was coming to market with a sedan first and not a higher-volume SUV. Akin to Lucid, Jaguar says its sedan-shaped GT will establish a design language and underscore its electric bona fides. But Americans especially don’t care about high-minded philosophies; they just want SUVs.
To the good: Jaguar may be out of cars for now, but it’s not out of money, engineering and resources. And nearly every EV purveyor, legacy or start-up, is currently struggling to make a go of it. Lucid and Rivian have yet to earn a profit, and are burning through billions of dollars each quarter, with the Saudis and Amazon/Ford as their respective key financial patrons. At Ford, the F-Series is the real sugar daddy, that bankrolls and offsets an EV operation that’s losing billions.
Jaguar Type 00 Concept
Jaguar’s deep-pocketed patron is Tata Group, India’s mightiest conglomerate.  JLR itself posted record revenues of $36.3 billion in the last fiscal year. JLR’s $2.75 billion in profit is its highest since 2015. Wait, actual profits? Lucid’s Peter Rawlinson and Rivian’s RJ Scaringe would pop champagne at the very thought. Sure, Land Rover generates roughly 100 percent of those earnings. But Land Rover has been carrying Jaguar like a sickly kitten since Ford sold both brands to Tata 16 years ago. What’s a few more?
Finally, the Jaguar name still carries more recognition than any start-up. Among laypeople, I hear this all the time: What’s a Rivian? Lucid, you say? But people know Jaguar, for better or worse. Their doctor or neighbor once drove one. A mechanic told them they should never buy one. In this brand-obsessed culture, that three-syllable name—redolent of classic cars, fragrant leather, British royals, the gentrified good life—still has potential value. If this revival fails, I can see the brand being sold to a Chinese automaker just as BMW bought Britain’s foundering Rover Group in 1994, then broke it up and sold the Land Rover portion to Ford in 2000.
Something else is being overlooked. Jaguar appears on track to become the world’s first legacy luxury brand with an all-electric lineup, even as others backpedal from promises. For people who support EVs and the fight against climate change, wasn’t that the idea all along? So let’s go easy on the hot-pink outrage, reserve judgment for now, and maybe hope that this once-glorious brand can thrive again.
Jaguar’s electric transformation does appear to be the ultimate Hail Mary play. But teams draw it up for a reason: Every once in a while, it works.

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares Quits Amid Strategy Dispute,https://insideevs.com/news/742850/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-resignation/,"UAW boss Shawn Fain, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the move is “a major step in the right direction.”",2024-12-02 03:14:35,"Carlos Tavares has suddenly resigned from his position as Chief Operating Officer at Stellantis, one of the largest car manufacturers in the world. The decision was announced yesterday evening and the board of directors has already accepted Tavares’ resignation.
Stellantis has created an Interim Executive Committee which will effectively do Tavares’ job until a new CEO is appointed “within the first half of 2025.” Board of Directors chairman John Elkman leads the IEC.
Previously, Tavares, who has acted as CEO since Stellantis’ creation in 2021, said he would stick to his role in the company until his mandate ended in early 2026. The comments came after Stellantis acknowledged it was looking for a successor to him.
More Stellantis Stories
Bloomberg wrote that Tavares’ sudden resignation came after a dispute with the board over how to turn the tides on weakening sales and a stock slump. In the third quarter, Stellantis reported a 27% drop in revenue and a 20% decline in shipments globally. In North America, the picture is even bleaker, with shipments down 36%.
Earlier this year, the automaker announced it would sell its massive Arizona proving grounds by the end of the year as a cost-cutting measure. Slow sales have also prompted Stellantis to pause the production of several models around the world, including the venerable Fiat Panda, electric Fiat 500e, Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee. The launch of the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and the range-extended Ram 1500 Ramcharger has also been delayed.
Maserati, the conglomerate’s highest-priced brand, is bleeding money, and Alfa Romeo, a staple of the Italian auto industry, is having a rough time appealing to American consumers–the Giulia sedan was the slowest-selling car in the U.S. in September, according to an analysis by CarEdge. Chrysler, meanwhile, is trying to survive with just one model in its lineup, the Pacifica minivan.
Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, who criticized Tavares in the past, said the decision is “a major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.”",Iulian Dnistran
"Lotus Delays Electric Sports Car, Hybrid Emira Could Happen",https://www.motor1.com/news/742660/lotus-emira-hybrid-possible/,The Emira might stick around longer now that its electric replacement has been pushed back.,2024-12-25 07:27:56,"At the beginning of the year, Lotus said it would replace the Emira with a purely electric sports car before the decade's end. However, the zero-emission “Type 135” is being delayed now that the British marque has realized the transition to EVs will take longer than initially estimated. The Geely-owned brand has already pushed back its objective to go completely electric by 2028. Where does that leave Emira? Its life cycle could be extended.
Asked by Autocar whether a hybrid Emira could happen, the firm’s European CEO Dan Balmer didn’t rule it out: “In today's world? 'Never say never' is the current rule because we have to be open-minded and understand what the marketplace wants and also what technology is available to us at the time. So the potential for hybrid powertrains is there.”
It's too soon to identify what sort of a hybrid the Emira would be. However, Lotus did say earlier this month that it plans to launch plug-in hybrids. The engineers are also working on range-extenders where the gasoline engine serves as a generator to juice the battery. In specific scenarios, such as driving at higher speeds on the highway, the car would run strictly on the combustion engine. This technology has been dubbed ""Hyper Hybrid.""
Let's not forget that the Emira borrows its two engines from other automakers. The base model uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline unit from AMG. Mercedes' Affalterbach-based division offers this “M139” four-cylinder mill in mild-hybrid flavor in its “35” compact cars and as a plug-in hybrid in the heavily criticized C63, plus the GLC63. Codenamed “2GR-FE,” the beefier supercharged 3.5-liter V-6 is sourced from Toyota, and it, too, has been electrified already.
If Lotus decides to hybridize the Emira, it means that the car will certainly put on weight. Seeing the glass half full, at least it’ll remain on sale longer. While an electrified setup is exactly the opposite of Colin Chapman’s “simplify, then add lightness” ethos, it represents a necessary evil. Emissions regulations are getting stricter worldwide, so for the sports car to survive, it needs a hybrid setup to comply.
In the eyes of a Lotus customer, a hybrid Emira will probably be more appealing than the electric successor anyway. At least there’s a combustion engine behind the seats, right? Logic tells us the hybrid would still be significantly lighter than a similarly sized electric sports car. The EV was supposed to be co-developed with Renault’s Alpine performance division, per an announcement made in early 2021. However, the two companies parted ways last year, deciding to go solo instead.
Aside from delaying the two-door EV, Lotus is also pushing back its Porsche Macan rival. Positioned below the Eletre, the “Type 134” crossover was scheduled to come out in 2025, but that’s not happening anymore. Why? “The market has told us what it wants and when,” according to Balmer. In other words, there are concerns demand for the smaller electric SUV would not be enough.

"Tesla, Two Other Brands' EV Sales Are Most Driven By Tax Credits",https://insideevs.com/news/742782/tesla-ev-tax-credit-jdpower-study/,"The modern EV tax credit system may be on the way out when President Trump returns, but it has some surprising winners and losers.",2024-11-30 16:25:31,"President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal the electric vehicle tax credits ushered in by the Inflation Reduction Act, but that move is surprisingly supported by his new buddy-advisor-campaign financier Elon Musk. But a new study from J.D. Power indicates that Tesla's sales really do stand to take a hit if those credits go away.
The auto industry marketing research firm's latest E-Vision Intelligence Report has some fascinating new data about which automakers benefitted most from the tax credits, which cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new EV purchase or lease if certain conditions are met. The biggest winners: Volkswagen, Chevrolet, and Tesla, in that order.
""Among all EV purchase drivers, tax credits and incentive programs are the most frequently selected reason for purchase among Volkswagen (81%), Chevrolet (77%) and Tesla (72%) buyers,"" the study said. The report was based on a survey of new car buyers but interestingly does not include Tesla Cybertruck, Polestar, and Rivian owners.
To qualify for EV tax credits, generally speaking, the EVs and their batteries must be made in North America, as the IRA is meant to incentivize local production.
According to the survey, the ""premium vehicle segment""—of which all Tesla models are included—benefitted the most from the tax credits. While that does play into the criticism that tax dollars are essentially helping wealthier people buy expensive cars, it also makes sense; EVs for now are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts and cheaper, more mainstream models are just now starting to debut after years of being confined to the higher end of things. In the ""premium"" arena, ""64% of EV owners say tax credits and other incentives influenced their purchase decision. In the mass market segment, 49% of EV owners were influenced by tax credits and incentives."" And it seems like the inclusion of Tesla as a ""premium"" brand helped skew the data in that direction as well.
After all, a Volkswagen ID.4 can be obtained at fairly mainstream prices now, and all of Chevrolet's EVs represent great values that aren't too far off their gas-powered counterparts depending on equipment and trim levels. Thus, it could be argued that the tax credits are succeeding in moving the EV sector into more normal levels of pricing; as EV sales increase and the battery supply chain grows, prices will continue to go down.
The numbers are fascinating: ""Among premium brand EV owners, 64% say that tax credits and other incentives were a primary driver of their decision to purchase or lease their EV,"" the study said. ""Among mass-market EV owners, 49% selected their vehicle based on tax credits and incentives. Industry-wide, 87% of all EVs purchased or leased in 2024 received the federal EV tax credit.""
Moreover, the tax credits are helping people to save money at a time when new car prices are through the roof and everyone's getting squeezed out on grocery prices. ""On average, consumers purchasing or leasing a new EV in 2024 saved $5,124 thanks to federal EV tax incentives,"" the study said. ""That’s up from $4,302 in 2023 and $1,629 in 2022. For EV leases in 2024, the average amount claimed in federal tax incentives was $6,696, and for sales, it was $4,257.""
So whose buyers were least motivated by the EV tax credits? According to J.D. Power, that would be Toyota, Hyundai and Kia—a truly interesting result. None of those Asian automakers build their EVs in America (though this is changing right now with the new Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and others) and so they do not qualify for the tax credits unless they're leased. Somewhere between a fifth and a third of those brands' buyers said they were motivated by the tax credits. In Hyundai and Kia's case, EVs also benefitted from aggressive manufacturer and dealer discounts. That all tracks with what we already know: most Hyundai and Kia EVs are leased, and it may speak to why the Korean automakers' executives say they aren't worried about sales dropping if they lose the credits.
The study also confirms one thing we've been hearing for the past few years: that the EV tax credit scheme is confounding to many buyers and they probably aren't getting much help navigating it from their dealers. ""All told, 43% of EV shoppers say they would describe their understanding of current EV incentives as 'vague,' 'minimal' or 'don’t know,'"" the study said. ""Just 17% say they have a 'strong' understanding of EV incentives.""
There are a few things we can glean from all of this data. First, it's yet another data point that counters Musk's claim that losing the tax credits ""probably actually helps Tesla"" in the long term, unless he's counting on a total collapse of the sector without the IRA. Second, losing the tax credits will probably hit reset on the calculus the entire auto industry has been working on for the past few years. And finally, it's further proof that the tax credits are helping to move metal and save people money at the same time.  “Having that extra incentive was enough to convince people to buy their EV,” Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice, told Automotive News. “It wasn’t just the price alone.”

Porsche: Future EVs Might Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/742256/porsche-future-evs-gas-engine-possiblity/,"The company admits it's ""sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.""",2024-12-25 07:27:57,"Porsche has realized people still want gas cars, admitting recently the EV adoption isn’t going as planned. Indeed, sales of the fully electric Taycan sedan/wagon duo are down by a whopping 50% globally through the third quarter of 2024. Automotive News Europe now quotes the company’s Chief Financial Officer saying the new plan is to “react in our product cycle” by continuing investments in combustion engines.
Lutz Meschke said Porsche will be pouring money into gas engines for the Cayenne and Panamera. As already announced, the V-8 is sticking around for the long haul as it will live to see the 2030s, at least in the SUV. Interestingly, the CFO went a step further and admitted that future models initially conceived as EVs might spawn derivatives with ICE power:
“We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.”
That’s easier said than done considering upcoming models are all expected to ride on a dedicated electric car platform. As you can imagine, Meschke didn’t say which future EVs could be joined by gas-engine counterparts. We reckon the fullsize, three-row SUV known by its “K1” codename is a potential candidate. The luxobarge will slot above the Cayenne once it arrives in the second half of the decade. For now, it’s an EV-only product, but given the CFO's statement, that could change.
Of course, what we really want is for the next-generation 718 lineup to still have gas engines. The current Boxster and Cayman models will be phased out by late 2025 when their EV replacements are scheduled to arrive. Development is largely finished by now, so we’re circumspect about the prospects of seeing a gas engine. The sports car segment is small, so the math might not work out in the ICE 718’s favor.
Elsewhere, the previous-generation Macan won’t live past 2026. Its replacement is already here, sold only with electric drivetrains. Could Porsche find a way to cram in a gas engine? Or just refresh the first-gen model once again? Some would argue either solution is a necessity given how the smaller of the company’s two crossovers has historically been one of its strongest sellers. It was the most popular in 2021 and right behind the Cayenne in 2022 and 2023.
As for the 911, Porsche has no intention of launching a fully electric model this decade. However, the electrification process has already started with the new hybrid GTS. Next year’s Turbo will also be a hybrid.

Trump's 25% Tariffs Would Hit These EVs The Hardest,https://insideevs.com/news/742353/trump-tariffs-hit-these-evs-hardest/,The President-elect has vowed to implement a sweeping tariff on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico.,2024-11-26 16:00:55,"President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to sign an executive order for a sweeping 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada when he takes office on January 20. Trump revealed the plan on Monday on his social media platform, Truth Social, and the move could disrupt global trade and potentially cause a significant blow to the U.S. EV market.
EVs are gaining momentum in the U.S. with automakers reporting consecutive quarters of record sales growth this year, driven by a wave of new, relatively affordable models. Now this growth risks stalling if Trump follows through his proposed tariffs. Several automakers, including General Motors, Tesla, Ford, Honda, BMW and Audi rely heavily on manufacturing facilities across the southern border, making them particularly vulnerable to a policy shift.
Popular EVs currently like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Honda Prologue undergo final assembly in Mexico. While Tesla manufactures its EVs in the U.S., some of their components are sourced from Mexico, according to public records posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). InsideEVs scanned these records to see which EVs and PHEVs could be the hardest hit.
This list covers model year 2024 EVs and PHEVs as many MY2025 cars are not listed yet. Regardless, the percentage of vehicle content sourced from other countries gives us an idea of how the tariffs may affect these EVs.
Cybertruck
Dodge Charger Daytona EV (Upcoming)
As you can see, Tesla isn't immune to these tariffs. Still, it remains to be seen whether Trump will make an exception for the automaker. CEO Elon Musk is set to head the new Department of Government Efficiency and has donated millions to Trump's campaign efforts.
Trump also said that he would increase tariffs on Chinese-made goods by a further 10%. The U.S. has already imposed a 100% tariff on EVs made in China and has also banned Chinese software from being used in cars sold stateside.
Some 2.55 million cars manufactured in Mexico were imported to the U.S. in 2023, as per researcher GlobalFleet. Now, the fear of tariffs making cars more expensive is sending shockwaves across the industry. Share prices of several U.S. and European automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota fell on Tuesday in the face of uncertainty.
Japanese and Korean EVs appear relatively more insulated from Trump's tariffs, but not entirely as they still source a small percentage of components from China. But on a more positive note, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now manufactured at Hyundai Motor Group's Metaplant in Savannah, Georgia. The Ioniq 6 is entirely made in Korea.
The Genesis G80 Electrified, GV60, Ioniq 5 N, Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia EV9 and Kia Niro EV appear to use a small percentage of Chinese components. The Toyota bZ4x and Lexus RZ also use a small percentage of Chinese parts but are predominantly manufactured in Japan.
So if Trump goes through with his America-first tariffs, the big winners will be South Korean and Japanese automakers. It'll be American EVs, trucks and SUVs that will bear the brunt of the new duties.

California May Do EV Rebates Under Trump—Just Not For Tesla,https://insideevs.com/news/742194/california-may-revive-ev-rebates-if-trump-kills-tax-credits/,California Governor Gavin Newsom has floated the idea of reviving the state's EV rebates and leaving Tesla out.,2024-11-25 14:28:31,"California has spearheaded the electric vehicle movement in the U.S. and it doesn't plan to slow down anytime soon. If President-elect Donald Trump repeals the consumer incentives in January, California may restart its EV rebate program, the state's Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed on Monday. But there's a twist: Tesla's EVs would reportedly be excluded from the revival of this rebate program.
EV buyers of all eligible brands nationwide can currently obtain up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, depending on their individual tax liabilities, making adoption easier on the wallet. That’s on top of local and state-level incentives encouraging buyers to go electric. But Trump has threatened to repeal the federal consumer incentives on ""day one,"" falsely calling them a ""mandate"" and repeatedly attacking EVs on the campaign trail. He only recently warmed up to EVs after Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated about $200 million to his campaign effort. Musk and Trump both support ending the tax credits.
But now California's governor says the state won't budge. “Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong—zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California,"" he added. ""We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future—we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.”
Yet his office told Bloomberg today that Tesla will be excluded from this new proposal to allow rivals to catch up. The rebates would come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, wherein industrial polluters can purchase emissions allowances, which the government then uses to support climate programs across industries, including transportation. “It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,” the governor's office said in an email.
The state has sold over two million zero-emission vehicles so far. Its Clean Vehicle Rebate Program helped drive this adoption, but the program ended in Nov. 2023. Throughout its life, CRVP funded 594,000 vehicles, displaced 456 million gallons of gas and helped save nearly 4 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, according to the California Air Resources Board. Transportation emissions are public health hazards directly linked to respiratory illnesses and lung diseases.
Newsom has proposed to create a new version of CRVP to continue driving EV adoption to tackle climate change. Yet exclusion from a potential rebate scheme would be a blow for Tesla sales in the region. It's one of Tesla's sales strongholds—and the birthplace of its success. However, Musk and Governor Newsom's relationship soured after Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin. Newsom has also clashed with Trump on emissions regulations.
That said, Trump cannot single-handedly repeal the federal EV incentives. They are enshrined under law as part of the Biden administration's landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Any pullback would require congressional approval. Governor Newsom cannot revive the state's tax credit program unilaterally either. He requires approval from the state legislature. The state's budget is among the country's largest, but it has witnessed growing deficits since the pandemic, as per the California Legislative Analyst's Office.
California also wants to ban gas car sales by 2035 but has yet to receive federal approval. As many as 17 other states have either already adopted California's emissions standards or are finalizing similar regulations. However, Trump has threatened to strip California of its ability to set its own emissions standards, but he will likely face opposition. When he tried to do the same during his last term, the state sued his administration 120 times.

Tesla Sued This Startup. Getting It To Drop The Case Was ‘A Guessing Game’,https://insideevs.com/news/741987/tesla-evject-escape-connector-lawsuit-dropped/,"EVject makes a charging connector that allows EV owners to drive away while charging, potentially avoiding a dangerous situation.",2024-11-24 14:00:09,"Imagine the following scenario. It’s late evening, and you’re waiting for your EV to charge at a public DC charging station. You’re inside the vehicle and you see someone approaching. What do you do?
Maybe it’s nothing, but you’d rather drive away, just for peace of mind. Here’s the kicker, though: first, you need to unplug the charging cable. Do you have enough time? Will the person approaching you pick up the pace once he sees you are getting out of the car?
It’s a gut-wrenching experience and it’s why Utah-based EVject developed the Escape Connector. In short, it’s a sort of adapter that you hook up to the end of the charging cable and then plug in to recharge. If you need to drive away in an emergency, you just stop the charging session from the EV’s screen and then drive away. The connector is available for cars with a NACS, CCS1 or CCS2 plug.
More Stuff Like This
EVject’s connector splits in half, leaving behind the charging cable and bringing some much-needed peace of mind. Once the charging session is stopped, there’s no electricity running through the charger’s cable or the piece left in the charging port, so it’s completely safe.
Tesla, however, didn’t think so. It sued EVject earlier this year, claiming that the device was “unsafe.” Tesla subjected the Escape Connector to some stress testing and concluded that the temperature could exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit after 30 minutes.
According to EVject’s founder, Kreg Peeler, that testing session was deeply flawed and even Tesla’s equipment would have failed. “They didn't use any communication connections. All they did was wire the two hot pins, which means even if we had a thermal sensor, it would have kept charging,” Peeler told InsideEVs. “The only way any adapter, including Tesla adapters, knows when to turn off is if it stops the communication pins, or if it sends a different signal across communications. They didn't do any of that.”
Initially, Tesla sent a cease and desist letter to EVject, claiming that the Escape Connector and marketing materials surrounding it were infringing on Tesla’s trademark rights. EVject removed all Tesla references and everything else that could have had anything to do with trademark infringement, but then Tesla filed suit against EVject claiming the connector was unsafe.
The automaker eventually dropped the suit, but adapting the product to Tesla’s standard was “a guessing game,” according to EVject’s Kreg Peeler. The solution was to add a thermal sensor to the Escape Connector that automatically cuts off power if the surface temperature exceeds 140 degrees. But getting there was the tough part because Tesla didn’t simply say “Do this and you’ll be ok.” Instead, the maker of the Model 3 reacted when things were wrong, without offering the handbook for what needed to be done.
“Basically, they won't tell you what it needs to be, but they'll tell you when you missed,” Peeler said. “So that's kind of the way they play, and I think part of it is they're constantly changing, right? They're constantly adapting and pushing their own standards, and therefore they don't want to be on record quoting what the standard is because it might change next week. That’s my speculation, but that's what happens when you're really trying to change an entire industry.”
Peeler said he doesn’t hold any grudges against Tesla and reiterated several times during our interview that he and his company are Tesla fans. He just wishes things would have gone another way, with a little more constructive criticism and an easier collaboration.
One half of the EVject Escape Connector remains in the car's charging port and it can be easily removed after getting to safety.
The other half remains on the charging wand and it can also be removed without any risk of electric shock.
“We just wish they did things a little bit differently,” the startup’s founder said. “We don't like the fact that there is a big public notice saying that we were ‘unsafe’ because we just don't think that's the true statement.”
As for the roughly 3,500 people who ordered the device before the whole court case fiasco, they were offered free replacements with the updated version, but only 600 or so chose to go down this route. The remaining 2,900 kept their original connector was “fine.” Customers who need to use the connector in an emergency situation will get a free replacement. Owners can extract the half that stays in the charging port without any risk of being electrocuted, but the connector is fitted together with a special press at EVject's facility, so putting it back together by hand is impossible.
“We’ve never had one complaint from a customer,” Peeler said. “And they also recognize that the new device isn't going to change anything. We're not changing our materials. We're not changing the way it conducts electricity. Nothing about the device is changing, except if, frankly, Tesla overdrives their equipment, our device will turn off. That's it.”\",Iulian Dnistran
Rivian CEO On Dealer Laws: 'As Close As You Can Get To Corruption',https://insideevs.com/news/741992/rivian-ceo-dealer-model/,RJ Scaringe says that dealers essentially paid for laws that protect their business.,2024-11-22 13:10:51,"Despite its recent partnership with the German auto giant, Rivian has no plans to use Volkswagen's sales network, according to CEO RJ Scaringe. It wouldn't want to. But VW's service network is a far more interesting proposition, as scaling service has proved troublesome for Rivian and fellow direct-to-consumer automaker Tesla. Unfortunately, using VW service centers is probably not going to be possible in the U.S. Scaringe told reporters that dealers have made that almost impossible.
""Unfortunately, in the United States it's not an easy question. We have this horrific state-by-state level of rules that are as close as you can get to corruption,"" Scaringe told InsideEVs and other reporters during a roundtable.
""I think you essentially have, like, lots of dealers have paid for laws that make it really hard for us to interact directly with the consumer,"" he continued.
Many states have protections for car dealers codified into law. They broadly protect dealers from having to directly compete with manufacturers, but how those rules are interpreted and applied varies wildly. In Tesla's home state, Texas, the company cannot sell cars out of company stores. Instead, it must sell cars online, and can deliver them at ""service centers."" Rivian's space in Seattle is similar, as in Washington the company's representatives cannot talk about pricing or take orders.
These laws were—in most cases—designed to protect dealerships from their own manufacturers selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out the middle man and outcompeting them on cost. But they are now stifling brands that don't have dealerships to compete with. There's no AutoNation Rivian or Penkse Tesla losing business when these companies sell in Texas or Washington. There's no option at all if you, as a consumer, want to buy a Tesla and take delivery in Louisiana. So these laws are effectively protecting dealers of other brands from legitimate competition with new brands.
Related Stories
The states with the strongest laws protecting dealers tend to have extremely large and powerful car dealer lobbies, which wine, dine and donate to local politicians to make sure they have plenty of friends in state government. These friendly relationships tend to correlate with laws that make sure it is nearly impossible to buy a car without including a dealer in the transaction. It's not hard to see why Scaringe says this is essentially ""corruption."" They're spending vast sums lobbying and being rewarded with laws that restrict consumer choice and competition while protecting their profits.
Because the laws are different in every state, you have to grease a lot of wheels to get the train moving. There are still states where it is illegal to sell Rivians or Teslas directly. And there are many states where dealers plan to challenge Volkswagen's plan to launch Scout Motors with a direct-to-consumer model, a la Tesla. If even one challenge in a major market succeeds, it may mess up the whole plan. Because while it's hard enough to sell vehicles directly to consumers, it gets a lot harder if you also have franchises operating as official sales and service locations.
All of the issues Rivian faces with its direct-to-consumer push ""become exacerbated if we were to use a mixed model"" where they have directly owned and franchise service centers, Scaringe says. So it's likely not possible to use VW dealers for service, even if VW was cool for it. But the CEO is still clear-eyed that expanding service options needs to be a priority, and not just doing service where you sell cars.
""You don't need 5,000 retail locations in the United States to sell three or four million cars a year. Tesla's a good example. [Its] number of retail locations per sale is far, far lower than any of the incumbents. But you do need a lot of service infrastructure,"" he said.
The vehicle's ability to diagnose and report its own problems will help improve service efficiency, as will Rivian's ability to do most service in your driveway. Over half of the company's current service visits are handled by its mobile service arm. But the fact is that the service infrastructure needs to grow, regardless of how difficult it is to navigate the U.S.' state-by-state restrictions.
""We have a service backlog where we're trying to build as much service infrastructure as fast as we can. But in some markets, the product scaling has happened faster than we can build out service infrastructure,"" Scaringe said. ""That's a short-term anomaly. Long term, we think in the United States we're going to a build a really robust service infrastructure. In Europe, the question is—we'll do sales on our own—but whether we partner with somebody on service. It's certainly an opportunity.""
If Rivian needs a service partner in Europe, I know a company in Wolfsburg it could probably call.

Volkswagen's New American CEO Comes From Rivian,https://insideevs.com/news/741708/vw-rivian-laas-cm-2024/,"Plus, the Hyundai Motor Group's EVs plan to own the LA Auto Show, while Ford makes cuts in Europe.",2024-11-20 10:39:45,"The Rivian-Volkswagen $6 billion joint venture got a little more interesting this week. The Volkswagen Group of America, which includes the core VW marques plus Audi, Lamborghini and other brands, is getting a new CEO whose last stint was at the California-based electric vehicle startup. And it's a homecoming of sorts as well, since new CEO Kjell Gruner also ran Porsche Cars North America for a few years. Can he help turn around an iconic brand whose American future feels a bit murky these days?
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news from the mobility and technology spaces. Also on tap for today: we look at Hyundai Motor Group's big electric plans for the LA Auto Show, while Ford is cutting jobs in Europe.
VW NA CEO Kjell Gruner
Even I'll admit that the ""new CEO from Rivian"" in my headline is a bit of a reach here. Yes, Gruner is a former Rivian executive. But he was only the startup's sales chief for 11 months between 2023 and earlier this summer. Gruner is a 25-year auto industry veteran who worked as a manager at Porsche in Germany, what was then called DaimlerChrysler, then Mercedes-Benz, then back to various leadership roles at Porsche until he was CEO of its North American operations.
Gruner's appointment to the top job was announced yesterday alongside the departure of Pablo Di Si, who VW officials said ""stepped down from his position last week on his own request."" Di Si had been CEO of the division for about two years.
So why the change? It's hard to point to one particular reason, but across the board, the global VW Group is generally not in fantastic shape. It's getting creamed in China by new, local competitors, losing ground in Europe to them too, struggling with a shrinking overall car market, and probably has a war brewing with its labor unions as it seeks unprecedented plant closures. In the U.S., it's doing a little better; Automotive News reports sales were up 19% in Q3, but on the backs of heavy discounts, which is never great for the bottom line. And VW's once-ambitious electric transition feels more endangered than ever. After years of hype, in the U.S. it just sells the ID.4 and now the ID.Buzz—the former's sales haven't been great as of late and the latter is on the expensive side for the range it offers.
Volkswagen, as a brand and as a conglomerate, seems to be in the midst of figuring out what it really is in 2024 and beyond. Perhaps Gruner will be able to help figure that out, at least on our shores.
Hyundai Ioniq 9 teaser
One automaker that does seem to have things figured out is Hyundai. Its leaders have repeatedly insisted that it's not slowing down on the EV front as many rivals are, and that it can capitalize on its huge U.S. investments. But that theory is about to get tested if the EV tax credits evaporate.
We'll see a lot of that at this week's LA Auto Show, which like most big auto shows has been inconsistent in terms of new product news in recent years. But Hyundai and its brands are the ostensible stars this time: we expect to see the Hyundai Ioniq 9, the U.S.-spec 2026 Kia EV6, the public debut of the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, some news from Genesis and more. Plus, all of the cars debuting here should have the Tesla NACS plug and almost all—if not all—may end up being built in the U.S. too.
Expect more on these debuts as we get them.
Ford Explorer EV production start in Cologne, Germany
But again, not everyone is having a great time in this space. Ford is cutting jobs in Europe as its Capri and Explorer EV models, which are based on a VW Group electric platform, seemingly fail to take off. Here's Agence France-Presse:
""The company has incurred significant losses in recent years,"" Ford said in a statement, blaming ""the industry shift to electrified vehicles and new competition."" The move will affect 2,900 jobs in Germany, 800 in the UK and 300 in western Europe by the end of 2027, a Ford spokesman told AFP.
""It is critical to take difficult but decisive action to ensure Ford's future competitiveness in Europe,"" said Dave Johnston, Ford's European vice-president in the statement.
The company also said it was adjusting the production of its Explorer and Capri models, resulting in reduced hours at its Cologne plant in the first quarter of 2025.
Europe's entire car market just isn't in a great way right now.
2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz U.S. edition first drive.
What's your advice to Gruner as he steps into the top job? How does VW's American arm—now more important than ever, with China sales shrinking—kick things into high gear?

Make No Mistake: Killing The EV Tax Credit Hurts Tesla Too,https://insideevs.com/news/741135/tesla-ev-tax-credit-end/,"Suddenly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he's anti-subsidies. He may want to double-check his own balance sheet.",2024-11-15 10:00:51,"When former President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to end the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, many people pointed to his newfound close ties with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as proof that he wouldn't really act to deliberately harm America's nascent EV sector.
But as with all things Musk, it's not that simple. It never is.
Yesterday, Trump's transition team made headlines when sources told Reuters that it was already formulating plans to kill the credit, and that Tesla representatives told the team they supported the move. In other words, America's largest EV maker favors ending a subsidy that has helped drive millions of its sales so far. (Tesla no longer responds to requests for comment from news outlets.)
It's a baffling argument to make. The U.S. auto industry and related companies like battery manufacturers are investing some $300 billion into EV production aimed at giving America the tools to compete with a rising China, which also heavily subsidized that transition.
But the going theory is that Tesla is the only American automaker (and really, the only Western one) that is profitable and manufacturing at scale with EVs, so ending the tax credits would hurt competitors taking up Tesla's market share like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai and others. Musk has been saying this for a while; on his social media platform X in recent months, he called for an ""end [to] all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas."" And on a July earnings call, he said ending the credit would be ""devastating for our competitors"" but ""long term probably actually helps Tesla.""
That may depend on the length of the ""term"" Musk is talking about these days. Unless you have complete and total blind faith that his five-dimensional chess game will prevail in the end, this is not good news for Tesla, and its ostensible CEO may want to look at his own balance sheet before he pushes for this.
Tesla EVs
There's no getting around the fact that ending tax credits will hurt the entire EV sector. It's why the U.S. auto industry's top lobbying group is so opposed to the move, urging Congressional Republicans to keep this momentum going or risk losing out to China. Granted, Tesla has always been an outlier in that space, even more so than other startups like Rivian and Lucid; Musk has long leaned into the idea that it's a ""tech company"" rather than an automaker, which is what drives its sky-high valuation.
Yet as countless critics have pointed out, Tesla has long depended on subsidies of all kinds. (So have Musk's other companies, including lucrative government contracts.) The EV and hybrid tax credit actually dates back to the George W. Bush administration. Save for a few years in the late first Trump era and the start of President Joe Biden's before the Inflation Reduction Act kicked in—when automakers would lose the original credit after selling a certain number of cars—Tesla has almost always benefitted from those credits in some way.
While Tesla's U.S. sales have been dipping due to increased competition, the potential backlash to Musk's online presence and politics and its aging lineup (more on that in a moment), it has benefitted tremendously from the IRA too. Though Tesla also implemented intense price cuts in 2023, those tax credits still helped propel it to more than 650,000 sales in 2023—a 25% jump from the previous year. And even though not every current Tesla model qualifies due to where some of their batteries are made, this certainly does help move metal.
Other kinds of subsidies help just as much. It's unclear which ones Musk really wants removed, but Tesla has racked up billions of dollars over the years in regulatory credits: essentially, other manufacturers buy credits from Tesla because they themselves cannot meet strict emissions targets. It's represented almost $2 billion in revenue in each of the past two years. Does Musk want to get rid of the system that creates that situation too? It's unclear.
That doesn't sound like a lot for an automaker that pulled in $96 billion in revenue these past two years, but between that and the hit to sales, it does add up. So does the fact that Tesla once banked on being a key charging driver for the rest of the auto industry. Every U.S. EV maker switched to its plug type and got, or is working on, a deal to access its Tesla Supercharger network. One analyst I spoke to said that was pegged to add up to an additional $20 billion for Tesla by 2030.
If the EV tax credit dies and electric sales from other automakers fall, you can add that revenue to the tally as well.
Tesla Cybercab Robotaxi
If you were to ask Musk in one word the real reason he's doing this, my guess is it would be ""robotaxis.""
This era of Tesla is betting the farm not on electric cars or competing with China, but on the idea that one day it will crack the code of fully autonomous driving. In theory, then everybody will want to move to its cars en masse because driving yourself will be as outdated as owning a horse. (Indeed, that's a big part of why Tesla implemented so many price cuts in 2023: get as many people into its cars as possible and then charge for Full Self-Driving subscriptions.)
But if that's the plan, it must be where Musk means ""long-term."" Autopilot and FSD have gotten better in recent years but they're nowhere near ready for truly autonomous, steering-wheel-free driving. Google's Waymo robotaxi service has logged more than 25 million miles of human-free driving so far; Tesla has logged essentially none. Even in the consumer car space, there are technologies that automate driving assistance better than Tesla can in many scenarios since the automaker is wholly dependent on AI and cameras instead of advanced sensor suites.
Now that he's close with Trump, Musk is also banking on being able to tear through regulations that he feels are holding autonomous vehicles back while setting new ones to drive their growth. But again, that's a long-game strategy at best that isn't validated by anything we've seen so far from Tesla's actual technology. And the company still has to sell cars in the meantime to bankroll that dream.
Tesla Model Y
This is where things really start to fall down for Tesla: its family of cars is getting old. The world's best-selling car in 2023, the Model Y, is quickly losing ground to new competitors in terms of specs and performance. Other automakers are quickly expanding into electric spaces that Tesla is ignoring, like three-row SUVs and affordable compact cars. Musk even recently said he sees no point in making a ""regular"" $25,000 EV that isn't fully autonomous because it wouldn't be investing in the future; ""it would be completely at odds with what we believe,"" he said on a recent earnings call. And there are many signs that Cybertruck demand is slipping as well.
Tesla is expected to release an updated ""Juniper"" Model Y next year, and there's little doubt that will juice EV sales. But with Musk increasingly bored with making cars, and very few new models on the horizon, and an industry and driving populace just not ready for full autonomy yet, where does Musk expect growth to come from? Perhaps the plan for Tesla is to kneecap its EV competitors, coast with modestly updated versions of its current cars, live without regulatory credits and then wait however long it takes to become a robotaxi company—all while hoping the fallout from Musk's own antics don't completely tank its own sales.
If that's really the case, we should all get comfortable. We're going to be here for a while.
In the meantime, it's hard to see who really wins from killing the tax credits besides the oil industry and China. It certainly won't be this country's largest electric automaker.

‘He Doesn’t Know How To Make A Battery’: China’s CATL Chief Blasts Elon Musk,https://insideevs.com/news/740941/he-doesnt-know-how-to-make-battery-musk-blasted-catl-chief/,"CATL is the largest battery manufacturer in the world. Its founder and chairman, Robin Zeng, disagrees with Musk on several topics.",2024-11-14 03:56:18,"Tesla placed a big bet back in 2020 when it announced that it was developing a new battery cell format. The 4680 battery, as it’s known, powers the Cybertruck and in the past, it made its way into a limited number of Model Y crossovers.
The cylindrical cell was touted as being more energy-dense than the 2170- and 1865-type units found in the Model Y and Model 3 and the Model S and Model X, respectively. It’s also supposed to be cheaper to manufacture and easier to assemble.
Recently, Tesla announced that it produced its 100 millionth 4680 cell. That’s a big achievement and a sign that the company managed to ramp up production of the proprietary cell significantly to reach an average manufacturing rate of 495,000 cells per day. That’s enough for 368 Cybertrucks.
More Battery Stuff
However, the biggest battery maker in the world, Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited, better known as CATL, believes that going down the cylindrical cell route is a dead end. CATL’s founder and head honcho, Robin Zeng, told Tesla CEO Elon Musk this to his face. The reaction was silence.
Zang, who spoke with Reuters, said he had told Tesla’s head honcho that his bet on the 4680 cylindrical battery “is going to fail and never be successful.”
""We had a very big debate, and I showed him,"" Zeng said. ""He was silent. He doesn't know how to make a battery. It's about electrochemistry. He's good for the chips, the software, the hardware, the mechanical things.""
But that’s not all. Zang also had some remarks about Musk’s tendency to set unrealistic timelines for upcoming products. ""His problem is overpromising. I talked to him,"" Zeng said. ""Maybe something needs five years. But he says two years. I definitely asked him why. He told me he wanted to push people.""
Tesla 4680 cylindrical battery cell
CATL prismatic battery cells
Musk has been pushing the narrative that Tesla vehicles will be able to drive themselves for about a decade. This promise culminated with the reveal of the Cybercab robotaxi which will supposedly go on sale in 2026 without a steering wheel or pedals.
""He probably himself thinks it needs five years, but if you believe him when he says two years, you will be in big trouble,” Zang said for Reuters. “The direction is right.""
Zeng met with Musk in Beijing in April and the two often talk about various topics, according to Reuters. For context, CATL is a major supplier to Tesla’s Shanghai factory which assembles the Model 3 and Model Y EVs for local and international markets. Tesla has also licensed CATL technology for its upcoming battery manufacturing facility in Nevada, which is expected to become operational next year.
Tesla’s 4680 cylindrical cell uses a lithium-ion chemistry with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode. Meanwhile, CATL specializes in manufacturing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic cells. Recently, the Chinese giant introduced a consumer-grade sodium-ion battery which is even cheaper to manufacture than LFP cells.",Iulian Dnistran
How VW Got A 'Wake-Up Call' That Sparked A Rivian Team-Up,https://insideevs.com/news/740871/rivian-volkswagen-software-venture-cm/,"Plus, Trump prepares to take on California's emissions rules, and we look at Elon Musk's plans for our government.",2024-11-13 11:30:40,"Anyone who follows the electric vehicle race closely knows that the Volkswagen Group has struggled on the software front for years now. That's a broad term, but it includes everything from in-car subscription services to over-the-air updates to autonomous driving. But what probably no one expected is that VW's tech headaches would lead it to a small but scrappy American startup for help. Now, we have a clearer idea of why that happened.
That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news from the tech and automotive space. Also on deck: President-elect Donald Trump may target California's ability to regulate its own vehicle emissions, and we look at Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big plans for the U.S. government. Let's dig in.
2025 Rivian R1 Internals
It says a lot when the world's second-largest car company by sales needs backup from a startup that's never once turned a quarterly profit. But the new $5.8 billion deal between Rivian and VW is a win for both sides: Rivian gets access to capital it badly needs to cross the so-called ""Valley of Death"" to reach true profitability, and VW gets a ""next-generation electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology"" for future vehicles. And that tech will serve both companies, too; the Rivian R2 is expected to use it, as is the new Scout Motors vehicles and future electric VWs—including subcompact cars, the companies said in a press release.
And VW gets to lessen its reliance on Cariad, the in-house software division originally created to consolidate and advance what used to be disparate efforts spread across many brands. But Cariad has, perhaps infamously now, become a money pit with frequent layoffs amid important new car delays.
The Wall Street Journal today explains the other thing that got VW moving: China.
VW’s big wake-up call was the Shanghai auto show in April 2023, when the carmaker saw firsthand that digital features such as automated driving and voice control were proliferating on Chinese cars, while Cariad kept on missing deadlines.
A few months later, VW announced a deal to collaborate with Chinese startup Xpeng to jointly develop tech-forward EVs. But Steiner said VW knew that using Chinese technology in the rest of the world was a non-starter.  Shortly after, Blume met Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe at the Porsche Performance Center in Atlanta.
The talks ultimately became serious enough for the companies to form “clean teams,” whose members would have been contractually barred from working on similar projects if the deal had fallen through.
Yes, that auto show last year—the first one in China since the COVID-19 lockdowns—was a giant wake-up call to the entire car industry as to how far behind they'd fallen to those homegrown brands. (Which begs the question: how did they not know? It's not like they haven't been doing business in China for decades now.)
And VW and Rivian moved fast here, too:
By early June, they had stripped down a cutting-edge Audi Q6 e-tron shipped from Germany and fitted it with Rivian’s components as a lab project. The teams then started work turning a second Audi into a demonstrator vehicle that could actually be driven. A third Audi remained untouched as a reference point.
“In former times, we had kind of a claim that if something is not invented here within the VW ecosystem, it might not be good enough. Now this is gone,” said VW’s Steiner. “We cannot push the technological barrier in every area on our own.”
Of course, the Q6 E-Tron that's about to be on sale doesn't use Rivian-derived hardware or software; anything coming to the new cars will be from this joint venture, not from existing components, Scout's own CEO told InsideEVs recently.
But the lesson is clear: if any automaker wants a chance in hell to catch up to China's dominance in the EV race, they need to move at light speed on batteries and software. This should at least help with the latter.
California Highway
""How do we compete with China?"" is one of the biggest questions coming up in my discussions with industry officials, analysts and experts in the wake of Trump's successful re-election bid last week. The former president campaigned heavily against EVs (though he softened somewhat when he joined forces with Musk) and has vowed to roll back fuel economy and emissions rules driving more electrification—and end California's longstanding power to set its own rules there.
But this isn't like 2016-2020. That wasn't so long ago, but China's auto industry a decade ago was a cash cow, not a competitive threat. Back off in the EV race and America's automakers sign their death warrants at the hands of BYD; maybe not next year, but eventually.
So Automotive News previews what the re-elected president could be in for if he targets California: lawsuits, objections from automakers who need to stick with one set of rules so they can advance their technology, the state itself as a voting bloc and even the heavy trucking industry that's also signed on the Golden State.
The presence of a contractual agreement between the state and automakers, including BMW, Ford, Honda, Stellantis, Volkswagen and Volvo, plus the state’s continuing responsibilities under the Clean Air Act to maintain a certain air quality will complicate a Trump administration effort to block California’s green energy push.
“It’s obviously open to some question, but I think that the core structures are actually pretty favorable” to California, said Craig Segall, senior vice president of environmental group Evergreen Action and a former deputy executive officer with the California Air Resources Board.
[...] Beyond the agreements, automakers may take different approaches. John Boesel, CEO of clean transportation organization Calstart, said the ones that stay committed to the zero-emission push “will be rewarded in the long term.”
“I do wonder if the president is going to follow through on his previous commitment to undermine California’s authority,” he said. “He certainly seems willing to let states set their own policy regarding abortion.”
“This is the fight that California has been preparing for,” one analyst said. Then again, the same can be said of Trump.
Trump Musk EVs Bromance
You, a normal and sane person, may have seen the news last night that Trump will in fact appoint Musk to ""head up"" a ""Department of Government Efficiency"" alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. No, it wasn't just a campaign meme; it's actually happening. Supposedly.
Musk said during Trump's campaign that he would want to help reduce the size, restrictions and spending of the federal government, although he saves particular ire for regulations that get in the way of his own companies. But what can he really do here, and how will he still run Tesla on top of such a monumental job?
That's because this is more like a consulting gig, it turns out. More from Axios today in its morning newsletter:
Trump said in the announcement statement that the ""department"" will actually be outside the government. He said it could become the ""Manhattan Project"" of our time — a reference to the atomic race during World War II.
Musk said: ""This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!""
Fact check: It's essentially a non-governmental commission with no power other than to recommend things for people in power to do.
Congress could grant it official powers. But lawmakers are skeptical.
It also has an end date, Trump said, of July 4, 2026. So no, if anyone asks, Musk is not going to be leading some cabinet-level new division of the government (like when George W. Bush established the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11) but rather advise on where to cut. And it sounds like Ramaswamy will be managing whatever the day-to-day is.
But no one should underestimate Musk's clout here, especially after delivering such a victory for Trump. If regulations around everything from autonomous cars to spaceflight look different in the coming years, we may well trace it back to him.
Ford F-150 Lightning At Tesla Supercharger
We'll have more on this in the coming days. But given that Trump 2.0 is going to have a very different take on EVs than Biden did, and at a very different time in history, what does success look like in your mind?

The Honda Prologue Is Already Proving Toyota Wrong,https://insideevs.com/news/740597/honda-prologue-toyota-bz4x-sales/,"It may be a GM car underneath, but the electric Honda Prologue is a hit. And it proves people want good EVs from brands they trust.",2024-11-11 16:44:22,"One of the more interesting—perhaps even baffling—studies that we've highlighted this year is the one that indicated most consumers are convinced that the Japanese automakers are the ones leading the way on electric vehicles. This, of course, is not true; while companies like Toyota, Honda and Nissan pioneered hybrid vehicles and do very well there (the first two, anyway) they are now playing catch-up when it comes to fully electric cars.
But people still think of those brands as ""green"" and trust their generally excellent reputations for reliability and quality. Put simply, people want good EVs from the Japanese automakers. And Honda is proving that to be true more and more every month.
As we have reported before, the all-electric Honda Prologue is proving to be the unexpected EV hit of 2024. The most recent data running through the end of October had the Prologue at 18,309 sales this year; it outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E that month and has already bested the Nissan Ariya and Toyota bZ4X with year-to-date sales. Not bad at all for a total newcomer to the modern all-electric space.
While Honda has had a few U.S. EV offerings here and there like the old Fit Electric and Clarity Electric, the Prologue is Honda's first really serious entry into the space. The base version has almost 300 miles of EPA range, while the top one has 273 miles due to its all-wheel-drive and bigger wheels.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite
Under the skin, the Honda Prologue isn't even a Honda at all; it's a General Motors Ultium EV, made at GM's Ramos Arizpe, Mexico plant alongside its cousins the Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV. Then again, who cares? The specs are good and the whole package has lots of Honda touches, including its own take on the Android Automotive-based software system and—unlike most GM EVs—Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If you can't live without those things, the Honda may be the one to get of the three.
In fact, the Prologue is the subject of a recent Bloomberg story about how Honda is turning its brand loyalists into EV fans for the first time:
MeLissa Jones, a 45-year-old software developer in Utah, isn’t overly concerned about air quality or climate change, but she does love a Honda. The Pacific Blue Prologue that she got in June is her 19th. “It’s not that I really like electric, it’s just that I wanted the new Honda to try it out,” Jones said. “We drove it as soon as (the dealer) got one in.”
[...] Much of the Prologue’s draw lies in just how unremarkable it is. Its starting price — before incentives or fancier options like all-wheel drive — is $47,400, just $400 less than the average market value of all US cars in September, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Unlike many EVs, the Prologue’s performance will set no one’s hair on fire, but it does feature thoughtful and elevated details of the kind Honda evangelists have come to love. There’s a huge storage bin under the center console, for example, a massive sunroof, a supersized smartphone charging pad and a rash of buttons and knobs to preclude a flatscreen hunt-and-peck typical of the Tesla driving experience.
When asked why they chose a Prologue, Honda buyers cite trust in the brand followed by value, according to company spokeswoman Natalie Kumaratne. What’s more, almost two-thirds of Prologue buyers have owned a Honda before and nearly 80% have never had an EV.
Other car companies, take note: this is probably how EVs crack more mainstream adoption. People don't want spaceships, they want good specs and affordable prices from brands they trust. While Hyundai and Kia used the EV revolution as a chance to hit reset on their brand perceptions, there are tons of Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 buyers out there who just want the same cars they've always loved, minus the need for stops at a gas station. It's the way to win over those mainstream, next-wave EV drivers.

I'd argue that the above is why Toyota's bZ4X has done so well in certain months, especially when extra-generous deals and incentives get involved. But everything the bZ4X can do, the Prologue does better: it has more range, better fast-charging, better software and is, as Edmunds put it, ""a better vehicle in every meaningful way."" Even if it's not the best EV out there, it's clearly delivering what Honda owners want.
And I'd argue it's proving Toyota wrong right now. The bZ4X—which is a car I actually enjoy driving—has tremendous potential. Every time the InsideEVs staff tests the electric Toyota, we get tons of excited questions from curious onlookers; usually, it's some variation of ""Toyota makes an electric vehicle?"" People want EVs from brands they know and trust. If Toyota upped the specs on the bZ4X or maybe had a few other similar offerings in this space, it would be crushing it right now. Yet mere days after an election that could slow down the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle space, Toyota's executives are out there throwing water on California's EV goals. Maybe if they tried a little harder, this wouldn't be an issue for them. (And maybe a little intensified competition from Honda will get Toyota moving.)
2024 Honda Prologue Review
The point is that automakers have to meet people where they are, and the Prologue's steadily increasing sales in its very first year prove that the consumer may just be more ""ready"" than some companies think they are. This race is only going to heat up soon; all of them need to be thinking about whether they have the technology to meet the moment or not.

"Why Hyundai, Samsung And Korea May Stay Ahead In The Trump Era",https://insideevs.com/news/740458/korea-ira-ev-hyundai-trump/,The South Korean automakers and their battery companies bet billions on America's EV race. They see a 'limited' impact now.,2024-11-10 10:13:26,"Over the past four years, the U.S. has had a president who has aggressively supported clean energy investments and pushed for an electric transformation of the auto industry. In two months' time, the White House will be occupied by someone who's been openly critical of electric vehicles and has threatened to repeal the tax incentives and subsidies backing them.
So what happens to all the car companies, battery makers and supporting firms who have planned huge investments in American manufacturing? That's now the $300 billion question facing the entire industry. And if tax incentives may not exist to encourage EV purchases, those plans could face tremendous headwinds in the coming years.
But for the Korean automakers and battery manufacturers, the answer so far seems to be this: We've come too far to back off now.
That's the gist of this post-election report from Korea's JoonAng Daily, which certainly concedes that firms like Hyundai Motor Group, Samsung SDI, SK On and LG Energy Solutions are in an ""uneasy holding pattern"" ahead of President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump has vowed to end what he's falsely called a Biden administration ""mandate"" for EVs as well as Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies, including possibly EV tax credits and incentives for manufacturing.
Stellantis and Samsung SDI's Kokomo Gigafactory Marks Construction Milestone
But the Korean firms have already made big plans for the U.S., and in many ways, they're significantly further along than most—and they hail from a country that's a key American ally and one of its best opportunities to get ahead of China's battery dominance. While the U.S. may be concerned about China's incursion into the autos space and rise in the world, South Korea is basically next door to the country and has countless reasons not to back down here.
“SK On is bent on expanding U.S. investment regardless of the election results to jump on the bandwagon to contain China, though uncertainties are looming over the downsizing of the Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] in Trump’s second term,” the newspaper reported an SK On vice president as saying during a recent earnings call. “The entire repeal of the law is less likely to happen as some lawmakers in states considered Republican strongholds have recently voiced opposition to the IRA's abolishment... the impact on SK On could be limited.”
According to that story, LG has a similar take:
LG Energy Solution, Korea’s largest battery maker, also said it will push forward with the necessary investment in North America considering various anticipated circumstances such as the scheduled launch of new EVs by client automakers. “With the IRA requiring a strict process and political consensus, the AMPC benefits will be maintained in a broad framework,” said Kang Chang-beom, a chief strategy officer at LG Energy Solution. “The policy package aimed at containing China will surely be tightened no matter who wins, and LG’s position in the U.S. battery market will have to be solidified.""
Since Trump's definitive win last week, few automakers have stepped up to publicly announce what this massive shift in policy could mean for their EV plans—many of which have already been delayed or even canceled amid sales that are rising but out of sync with once-rosy projections. One of the only ones to weigh in so far has been a Toyota Motor North America executive who called California's especially aggressive EV targets ""impossible"" to meet. While it's not immediately clear if that statement was directly tied to Trump's ascension, it does represent the questions that are being asked more openly now.
Hyundai Motors Group Metaplant America (HMGMA)
But that's just one automaker. And one that's admittedly skeptical about EVs and slower to get more of them to market. It's a very different story with the Hyundai Motor Group and the various Korean battery firms that have been developing that technology for decades and also have a vested interest in not letting China get ahead.
Given that the Trump administration is hardly expected to be cozy with China, that's going to be a big part of the calculus ahead, according to Don Southerton, a longtime business consultant who has worked with various Korean firms.
""Based on what we know, President-elect Trump’s leadership will intensify Washington’s anti-China trade policies, so Korean battery firms must prepare to diversify and internalize their supply chains,"" Southerton told InsideEVs. ""If Trump blocks Chinese companies’ entry into the U.S. and loosens the regulations on autonomous driving, I see Korean battery firms benefiting.""
After all, those are the ones who have already bet big on the U.S. As JoonAng Daily noted, South Korea was the top international investor in America in 2023, with ""large-scale projects totaling $21.5 billion last year alone."" LG, Samsung and SK On are building battery plants across the U.S. to supply many automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, General Motors and more—not just Hyundai and Kia.
2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited
By the same token, the Korean automakers got in early and may be in a good position to succeed here. Hyundai's new Metaplant, which will produce the 2025 Ioniq 5 and other models soon, is Georgia's largest economic development project ever. And while that's a red state that went solidly for Trump last week, it's bringing too many jobs to be going anywhere—plus, Hyundai has already confirmed it's meant to be a flexible factory, able to produce hybrids as well as EVs. And extended-range EVs could be on the menu there too.
With more U.S. production coming soon, that means cheaper EVs and cheaper batteries as well. Plus, Hyundai's cars will be the first EVs out of the gate with the Tesla-style North American Charging Stanard (NACS) plug from the factory, granting those cars easy access to Tesla's charging network. Even if the EV tax credits vanish, they could be priced and equipped well enough to succeed on their own merits.
Southerton also echoed much of the present thinking across the industry: even if Trump wants to repeal all aspects of the IRA, that may be logistically tough to do. And the new president would probably have every reason in the world to keep jobs and manufacturing going strong—something he campaigned heavily on.
""In reality, this will take considerable work to roll back, with some severe repercussions,"" Southerton said. ""The Department of the Treasury would have to change IRA regulations and guidelines, which would probably result in litigation regarding IRA loans, guarantees, and subsidies. Trump, too, will need support from the Senate to 'scrap' the IRA. And, across America’s 'Battery Belt,' Republican senators have openly supported the laws to boost manufacturing on American home soil and with plants in red states.""

Toyota Calls California EV Rules 'Impossible',https://insideevs.com/news/740400/toyota-calls-california-ev-rules-impossible/,"A top Toyota executive is challenging California's EV ""mandate."" Is there really one in place?",2024-11-08 17:09:10,"Despite being a pioneer of hybrid technology since the late 1990s, Toyota has been a laggard in the electric vehicle race. The automaker offers several hybrid and plug-in hybrid models in the U.S., but there's only pure electric model in its portfolio, the bZ4x crossover. The Lexus RZ and Subaru Solterra are the same underneath but wear different clothes.
Toyota plans to launch several electric models in the next few years, including a three-row electric SUV made in America. It has also increased its investments in next-generation battery technologies and building out EV plants in the U.S. And yet, it has resumed criticizing the regulations that call for increased adoption of EVs to reduce vehicular pollution.
Jack Hollis, the chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said California's EV regulations would be ""impossible"" to meet, CNBC reported on Friday. “I have not seen a forecast by anyone … government or private, anywhere that has told us that that number is achievable,"" Hollis said.
For years, California has spearheaded the path towards broader electrification. The California's Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II regulation calls for 35% of new vehicle sales to be zero-emissions from model year 2026. These models can be a mix of plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel-cell models.
""At this point, it looks impossible. Demand isn’t there. It’s going to limit a customer’s choice of the vehicles they want,” he added. If the regulations remain unchanged, it will lead to ""unnatural acts"" and ""distort the industry,"" Hollis said.
It's unclear how it will ""limit"" choice, as consumers will have the option to choose gas, hybrid, or electric cars when they walk into a showroom for years to come. The word ""mandate"" gets thrown around unrestrained these days, whereas the current regulations only encourage increased adoption, not a national ban on gas cars.
Regardless of his remarks, EV adoption remains robust in the state. Some 22% of new cars sold in California through September were EVs. More than half of them were Teslas, but rival OEMs have started catching up. In the third quarter, U.S. automakers sold a record number of EVs nationwide, with experts saying that 10% market share was now within reach.
Twelve other states, including Washington and New York, have also adopted California's standards. Some plan to adopt the standards from model year 2026 onwards, whereas others plan from MY2027. California also plans to ban sales of gas cars from 2035 onwards, but those plans are pending federal approval and risk getting axed under the new Trump administration.
Scaling back the regulations may have a disastrous impact on the planet, which scientists say is already blasting past the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold that nations were hoping to limit warming to. Tailpipe emissions also have an adverse impact on public health and are linked to several diseases and illnesses.

Rivian Is Still Paying For A Big Mistake,https://insideevs.com/news/740352/rivian-q3-financial-profit/,The promising electric SUV and truck startup gets more bad financial news in Q3.,2024-11-08 09:32:28,"Rivian is having some growing pains, and it really felt them in the third quarter of this year.
On an earnings call Thursday evening, the electric startup announced that production, deliveries and revenue were all down, and a single component is largely to blame. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Rivian was struggling with the ramp-up of its updated 2025 R1S and R1T models thanks to a shortage of a part for its new in-house ""Enduro"" electric motors. Due to a miscommunication with one supplier, Atlanta-based Essex Furukawa, Rivian was unable to secure enough copper windings to get production to where it needed to be.
That shortage was reflected in last night's financials: revenue of $874 million in Q3, more than 12% lower than what analysts estimated. And down quite a bit from Q2's $1.158 billion in revenue.
""This has been a tough quarter for us because of some of those supply chain or supplier ramp challenges,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said on the call. ""And one of those suppliers in particular has limited our production quite substantially and we're working very, very hard to address that. This is one of our highest priorities in terms of the business.
Rivian delivered 10,018 cars in Q3, down from 13,790 in Q2 and way, way down from 15,564 cars in Q3 of 2023. However, there are still signs of optimism for the nascent automaker. In Q3 of this year, production of the new 2025 ""Gen2"" cars was actually up to more than 13,000 cars from Q2's 9,600, suggesting that while these results weren't what Rivian wanted, it is ramping things up and getting past this supplier issue. Scaringe said as much on the call: ""We're seeing this as really a short-term issue, but it certainly introduced challenges as we saw in Q3,"" he said.
Rivian R2
Perhaps more importantly, Scaringe said that these lessons—revamping the R1 models, bringing more components in-house and getting these problems solved—are being applied to the upcoming Rivian R2. That model is seen as key to Rivian's survival as it's a smaller, more midsize and more affordable electric SUV targeting a starting price around $45,000 before incentives.
""The R2 program is advancing,"" Scaringe said. ""From a timing point of view, it's on track. And the product itself is really exciting. It's delivering a level of performance and capability in a package that really looks and feels like Rivian, but it's doing it at a substantial reduction in terms of its overall cost."" Moreover, Rivian's battery partner LG had some exciting news for that car, announcing last night that it will get more advanced and higher capacity battery cells than current vehicles. Scaringe reaffirmed that the target debut for the R2 is still the first half of 2026.
In the meantime, Rivian is hoping that the R1S and R1T can carry it to the point where these new, more mainstream EVs can provide some relief. Soon, Scaringe said, that will come from the debut of the new Tri-Motor models: Rivians with one electric motor upfront and two in the back.
""Performance is better than our first generation [Quad-Motor Rivians], but with a much lower cost in terms of what it takes to manufacture and also with a substantial improvement to efficiency,"" Scaringe said. ""We also expect to see an increase in the R1 average selling price, as we improve our sales mix with more meaningful Tri-Motor sales in Q4.""
Perhaps most importantly, Scaringe said the company still expects a ""modest"" profit in Q4, which would be its first-ever. And Rivian officials reaffirmed that they hope 2025 will provide a ""positive gross profit,"" which would mean it would have to achieve both reliable scale and profitability with the current R1 models. That may be a tough order, especially with still-high interest rates impacting sales of expensive vehicles like the R1T and R1S.
Still, Q3's results were clear: Rivian can pull this off but it has a long way to go. And it literally can't afford mistakes like the one it made with its motor part supplier in the future.

America's EV Revolution Collides With A Second Trump Era,https://insideevs.com/news/740030/evs-trump-election-cm/,Trump has vowed to cancel the Biden administration policies that were driving an electric transition. What now?,2024-11-06 09:45:09,"What now?
If you have a vested interest in all the progress America has been making to forge a cleaner energy future, including with its automotive industry, the news that President Donald Trump will return to the White House is probably not what you wanted today. As we've covered exhaustively over the past few months, much of the electric vehicle transition in the world's second-largest car market was driven by new policies from the Biden administration. Those included EV charger growth and tax incentives to buy electric cars and build them stateside. Trump has vowed to target those policies if he was reelected, which he was last night in a possible landslide. So ""What now?"" is a pretty valid question for the auto industry, the charging industry, policymakers and the planet as a whole.
On today's edition of Critical Materials, we begin the process of figuring out what that all means.
Without a doubt, you're going to read a lot of reactionary, knee-jerk takes out there today and in the coming days. My goal as the Editor-in-Chief of InsideEVs is to give you something better: something more thoughtful, more thorough and more grounded in reality than what our worst fears may tell us. That's always been the case here, and this team will make sure it continues to be so. Let's dig in.
If you ask any automotive industry chief executive what they want most for the holidays, besides copious bonuses and returns for shareholders, they'd probably say ""regulatory certainty."" And that is very, very up in the air right now.
The Biden administration set a goal of 50% all-electric car sales by 2030. That was backed up by aggressive new emissions and fuel economy rules meant to gradually phase out new internal combustion sales. It was a huge reversal of the first Trump administration's policies, which actually rolled back emissions and fuel economy rules.
Basically, since carmaking is a long-term, capital-intensive business, automakers spend years planning their businesses around ways to meet those regulations; if they change every four years, it creates a tremendous deal of uncertainty around what products to build, what people will want and how to even sell them. Here are some highlights from Automotive News:
“A Trump victory leads to a lot of immediate volatility in the transportation policy space,” said John Miller, who covers sustainability policy for TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group.
With the House majority still in the balance, it’s unclear whether significant changes could come to the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump, without congressional control, still can revisit the act’s implementation guidelines, including those for the individual tax credit, commercial vehicle tax credit and used clean vehicle tax credit.
“Depending on how much [the individual tax credit] would be changed, it could be very detrimental to the North American automotive industry,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. “A lot of the demand for EVs currently is driven by that incentive, and that incentive feeds the manufacturers.”
The new Trump administration may also seek to delay light-vehicle regulations set to come into effect after the 2028 model year, which would also delay regulations for post-2032 model years — as well as eliminate California’s ability to set its own standards. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said this year that California’s waiver to set its own greenhouse gas emissions rules would be “immediately revoked” upon Trump taking office.
As that story notes, a large coalition of automakers has already agreed to meet California's tougher climate standards. But Trump could target California's ability to set those standards as well. Like I said, a lot is up in the air today.
In a career marked by taking big and improbable bets on things everyone else had written off—online banking, electric cars, space travel and more—Tesla CEO Elon Musk's biggest bet yet paid off in a massive way last night.
Nobody backed Trump harder than Musk. From effectively funding and running Trump's ground game in Pennsylvania to turning the pro-Trump volume to 11 on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Musk placed his eggs in the Make America Great Again basket, and it looks like he's gonna come out on top. He may even make good on his claim to advise, or even run, some kind of government agency aimed at dramatically slashing federal spending.
Does this mean that EVs have an ally in the White House? Or will Musk just be looking out for Musk, which to me means cutting regulations around space travel and cementing new ones for autonomous vehicles? And will the Trump-Musk partnership continue to hold steady?
What we do know is that it's already paying off big for Tesla. From CNN:
Early Wednesday, investors were already betting that Trump’s win will also be a win for Musk’s major public holding, Tesla (TSLA), sending shares of his electric vehicle maker up 12% in premarket trading. That lifted the value of the shares of Tesla that Musk owns outright by more than $12 billion, which works out to a better than a 10,000% return on the $119 million he donated to Trump. But there are risks for Tesla, even from Trump’s victory.
Much of Musk’s massive net worth can be traced to the government support his companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, have received over the years. Even if Vice President Kamala Harris had won, much of that money would have continued to flow. But even if some of the government support for electric vehicles is now trimmed or cut off, as is likely with Trump’s victory, Musk’s wealth will remain firmly intact. In fact, Tesla could benefit if government support for EVs ends.
[...] But Musk has said he’s not worried about the end of the tax credit, as Tesla sees it as a boon to legacy automakers’ efforts to move into the EV market and provide more competition.
“Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,” Musk posted on X in July.
Thanks to increased competition, Tesla’s global sales sank 2% in the first nine months of this year compared to last year. Sales and profit managed to improve in the third quarter, but it was the first time the company had ever seen such a drop in its history.
That's one plausible outcome here. Take away the subsidies driving EV manufacturing and development for General Motors, Polestar, BMW and countless others, and they retreat into internal combustion and Tesla gets ahead on EVs.
That, of course, depends on Musk actually wanting Tesla to focus on batteries and electrification and not just autonomy, something we've had considerable doubts about lately.
BMW Mexico battery factory construction
It's not just environmental regulations that are at stake here. Trump also ran with big promises of tariffs on all kinds of foreign-made goods, including cars. Just the other day, he threatened 25% to 75% tariffs on Mexican-made products—including cars—if the country didn't assist in reducing migration into the United States. Earlier, he promised to set a 100% duty on imported cars and trucks to boost American manufacturing, and then doubled that to 200% on the campaign trail.
It's not like the Biden administration, and past ones, haven't done this. Biden kept Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made cars and then boosted them to 100% for Chinese-made EVs. And the Chicken Tax has helped keep America's lucrative domestic truck industry afloat for decades. But implementing stiff new tariffs on a country like Mexico, which exported 2.5 million cars to the U.S. in 2023, would create new levels of uncertainty. It's not like auto factories can be ramped up overnight, and forcing so many cars to be built stateside would no doubt increase their costs.
Fears of anti-Mexico tariffs already put Honda on notice before the election was decided. Overnight, European auto stocks took a big hit as well, fearing the same. And that's on top of the disastrous year they've already been enduring. Via Reuters:
BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said potential import tariffs under the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump may benefit the automaker, even as shares in the German premium carmaker and its rivals fell due to concerns the sector would be hurt by escalating trade disputes.
Fears over import tariffs, which Trump has threatened on goods from the European Union, caused shares in BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche to fall 4.6 percent to 6.4 percent on Nov. 6.
Zipse sought to allay fears after presenting bleak third-quarter results, pointing to the company’s strong U.S. footprint that includes its largest plant worldwide.
The U.S. market accounted for 12.9 percent of the 3.1 million in German passenger car exports in 2023, making it the single-biggest export market for Germany’s carmakers. The U.S. is increasingly lucrative for German automakers because of robust demand for large SUVs and a slower shift to EVs than in Europe, allowing them to sell more of their higher-margin combustion-engine models.
Having covered the auto industry during the first Trump administration, I can tell you this: he says a lot of things. What he actually does is far more difficult to predict, but the mere act of saying it creates a unique brand of uncertainty that a lot of people are scrambling to figure out today.
Rivian Wall Charger
I hope to have more to say on this later, but here is what I do know. The auto industry has always chased two things: efficiency and performance. EVs represent the next evolution of both.
A U.S. government that's less inclined to throw money at the electric transition won't stop it, but it may well slow it down when other players—China, namely—show no signs of slowing down. Rolling back our clean energy goals will have profound effects on our climate, however. And hundreds of thousands of planned manufacturing jobs are now at stake if the policies of the Inflation Reduction Act get repealed.
So where does it all go from here? That's what we intend to find out next.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 Is Surging And The New One Isn't Even Out Yet,https://insideevs.com/news/739806/ioniq-5-sales-october-2024/,The Ioniq 5 had another great month. Again. And the NACS-equipped version is still on the horizon.,2024-11-04 18:40:39,"You might think a headline about the Hyundai Ioniq 5 having one of its best U.S. sales months ever might refer to the updated 2025 Ioniq 5, which will come from the factory with a charging plug that can natively use the vast Tesla Supercharger network. You'd unfortunately be wrong; that car isn't even out yet. And that makes the month the Ioniq 5 just had all the more impressive.
Hyundai reports that in October, its dealers moved 4,498 examples of the retro-futuristic electric crossover. That would make it the best October ever for the Ioniq 5, and the car's second-best sales month ever since it hit the market in force in 2022. It's also up a whole 51% since October 2023—an impressive result given how uneven EV sales have been this year for several automakers.
Generally, however, South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group has had far more wins on the electric (and increasingly, hybrid) front than losses. As we reported last week, electrified vehicle sales in particular helped Hyundai and its corporate cousin Kia to record October sales. Besides the Ioniq 5, the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe hybrids saw 140% year-over-year growth, and for Kia, the Sportage, Carnival and EV6 all posted record October sales as well. Not all models are created equal, however; the Ioniq 6 only saw 837 sales in October, down an unfortunate 32% since last year. Sedans are a tough sell these days; SUVs, less so.
And the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 continues to make a strong case for itself. Available in rear-wheel-drive or dual-motor all-wheel-drive, it can be had in several forms, including the basic 220-mile SE Standard Range all the way up to the 303-mile RWD SEL and Limited models. (Adding AWD drops range to a still-respectable 260 miles.) Packing an 800-volt electrical system, the Ioniq 5 is a charging monster too, capable of going from 10% to 80% in a manufacturer-estimated 18 minutes on a DC fast charger with speeds of 250 kW or more. Between performance, range, charging and style, it's a tough package to beat.
Moreover, we've seen some extremely impressive lease deals and discounts on the Ioniq 5, so be sure and do your homework if you're in the market for one.
But that package is going to get even better soon. The 2025 Ioniq 5 should be on sale soon, and since it's built in Georgia, it's expected to qualify for EV tax credits at purchase and not just when leased, as most Ioniq 5s currently are. It will also come from the factory with a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and access to the Supercharger network. Existing Ioniq 5s will be able to do the same soon via an adapter, which should offer the same level of charging performance. And the 2025 Ioniq 5 will also get a more rugged and off-road-focused XRT trim.
Hey, it's American now—it may as well lean into the vibe.

Want Some Good News? Electric Vehicles May Be Getting Less Partisan,https://insideevs.com/news/739783/ev-politics-partisan-study-autopacific/,EVs are radioactive this election season. But a new study indicates that attitudes in America are changing fast.,2024-11-04 14:00:00,"Here's a crazy idea: maybe, just maybe, not everything in America needs to play into our endless culture wars.
For now, at least, electric vehicles are right in those crosshairs. EVs—and the tax incentives provided by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that will help them get built and bought in America—have become so clouded by politics in 2024 that elected officials can't even campaign on the battery factories being built in their districts. As the U.S. explores a more energy-independent future and ways to compete directly with China's iron grip on battery technology, that kind of knee-jerk partisan pullback feels rather silly.
But politics alone may be less and less of a factor surrounding an EV purchase, according to new data from the industry research firm AutoPacfiic. According to that data, ""political identity is still a factor in electric vehicle (EV) ownership, but it may be becoming less of a factor for future EV acceptance.""
AutoPacific surveyed 12,000 Americans—including EV acceptors, rejectors and current owners—and asked why they did, would or wouldn't consider going electric. Their reasons for or against are the typical ones. They're worried about the still-higher costs of EVs, the prevalence or lack of charging, environmental concerns, challenges with cold-weather range and overall range.
Another reason is political: EV adoption in America so far has been largely concentrated in wealthier, coastal areas that generally lean Democratic. This, coupled with the unpopularity of EV-related tax incentives and widespread misinformation about what critics say is an ""EV mandate"" to ""force"" people to go electric has led to more negative perceptions of these vehicles in more conservative, Republican-leaning areas. Earlier this year, data from Republican political consultant and EV advocate Mike Murphy showed how stark the divide is, and the rhetoric found in the various campaigns across the country has certainly reflected that.
But AutoPacfiic says that as EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids grow across many car brands' lineups and continue to decrease in price, that divide is beginning to narrow. ""Findings reveal that 54% of current EV owners and 60% of current PHEV owners identify themselves as Democrat compared to 30% of EV owners and 26% of PHEV owners identifying as Republican,"" the study said.
AutoPacific's Director of Marketing and Consumers Insights Deborah Grieb added: “Our analyses of EV owners over the years have clearly shown a correlation between more left-leaning political views and EV early adopters. But as EVs continue to expand across brands, vehicle types and price ranges, that association is showing signs of fading."" In fact, the 46% of respondents who said they intended purchase an EV or will consider purchasing one in the future were all fairly evenly split among Republicans, Democrats and Independents.
“When it comes to EV rejection, politics do play a small role, albeit a declining one,” Grieb said. “But rejection of EVs is much more likely to be due to charging and cost concerns.”
And that's much more fair, isn't it? Because unlike political perceptions that often aren't based in fact—including politicians who rail against EVs even as massive projects spring up in their districts to bring tens of thousands of new jobs—problems like charging and costs are real and also fixable. The U.S. is adding as many as 1,000 new EV chargers every week and new and used prices are going down as well. Moreover, it's hard to look at relatively normal and normal-looking electric vehicles like the Chevy Equinox EV and Ford F-150 Lightning and argue that driving one is some kind of ""virtue-signaling."" In reality, this is just another powertrain choice, and one that can often save people a ton of money on things like gas and maintenance over time. Simply put, it does not need to be as political as it is right now.
That's just hard to see from the hyper-charged environment we find ourselves in right before Election Day. As Politico's E&E News reported recently, politicians on the Democratic side have been advised to stay far, far away from anything EV-related; indeed, you won't be seeing Kamala Harris out there touting electric investments the way Joe Biden once did. “Voters really, really hate electric cars, so stop talking about them,"" said David Schor, a progressive pollster with Blue Rose Research, at an event earlier this summer. Meanwhile, these cars have become a cudgel in multiple battleground states, but especially Michigan. Anti-EV ad spending is through the roof and the entire auto industry is in ""wait and see"" mode to find out what those subsidies and tax incentives will look like from 2025 onward.
But that's right now, and any industry-wide transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. Maybe AutoPacific's data indicates people are coming around, no matter who they want to vote for.

These Red And Purple States Are EV Epicenters. What If Trump Wins?,https://insideevs.com/news/739308/ev-carolinas-election-politics/,North and South Carolina are seeing an EV jobs boom. But politics could change that soon—and who really wins then?,2024-10-30 13:52:14,"When one thinks of American technology and innovation, Silicon Valley is usually the first place that comes to mind. But in recent years, another region of the United States is going all-in on EVs, challenging the West Coast’s sector dominance. That’s the Carolinas.
North Carolina will be home to Toyota’s upcoming hybrid battery manufacturing facility. It recently saw the opening of European battery manufacturer Alpitronic’s U.S. headquarters and charging giant Kempower’s U.S. office. There’s also Thomas Built’s electric school bus manufacturing facility, VinFast, Natron Energy and more.
Toyota North Carolina Battery Plant Construction
And that’s just one Carolina. South Carolina is seeing upgrades and expansions to plants owned by BMW and Volvo to make future EVs and batteries and, perhaps most notably, Scout Motors’ all-new $2 billion factory to make electric and extended-range trucks and SUVs.
The Southeast’s EV game is proliferating big time, to put it mildly. And much of that is thanks to the investments and tax incentives pushed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden Administration’s signature infrastructure and climate legislation.

But there’s something else notable about the region. North Carolina voted for President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. And it’s likely that Trump could win the swing state again in 2024. South Carolina, Trump almost certainly has in the bag. And begs a question: if the region’s EV efforts flourished under a pro-EV federal administration, what would happen if different leadership was in the White House?
We don’t really know yet. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is expected to continue or even expand those policies; Trump is not, to put it lightly.
But the two states are part of a nationwide boom that few people would want to see disappear if, for example, Trump makes good on his threats to end Biden’s EV and climate subsidies. “We need to future-proof our economy and make sure we're getting modern innovative companies here,” says Christopher Chung, the CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina.
North Carolina’s popularity with electric vehicle ventures stems from several avenues. These include lower labor costs, cheaper taxes, proximity to coastal ports and existing car manufacturing ecosystems and a diversified workforce, thanks to local universities and technical colleges.
“We're a manufacturing state, historically,” Chung told InsideEVs. “If you're looking at doing EV assembly or battery manufacturing, knowing and working with a state that has a strong manufacturing history is really important.
But these factors alone aren’t enough to woo manufacturers considering the state. The rest resides within the locality’s ability to incentivize companies to set up shop. “Incentive packages are usually split at both a state and local level because typically a company is not just choosing a state to do business in, but they're choosing a specific county and sometimes a specific city within that county,” Chung said.
While North Carolina has its arsenal to facilitate EV growth, the federal government can do even more. The 48C section of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides tax credit incentives to businesses in the clean energy space looking to set up shop in the United States. “The 48C tax credit is probably one of the most common ones,” Chung said.
A possible Toyota electric SUV would be powered by batteries from its new North Carolina plant.
Portions of the IRA incentivize companies to establish facilities in the United States. The next part is on the state level. If a certain state offers a competitive incentive package, then there’s a good chance the business will reside in that state. And North and South Carolina just happened to be more competitive states. In other words, the IRA is like a shiny new car dealership. Once you go inside, you’ll choose the car that best suits your needs. (You want a three-row EV with all-wheel-drive? There’s the Kia EV9 for that.)
Chung said these incentive packages are usually complex as they have to weigh out numerous factors. “So our job is to try to understand, of course, what's the employment, investment, and the wages that a company is pledging to put here in the state,” he said. Another factor is what the company has to benefit the state.
Take Toyota’s battery plant, for example. Given the automaker’s huge push to turn most, if not all, of its lineup into hybrids, that plant will be busy for a long time. And while Toyota has been slower than most to embrace fully electric cars, Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina will be set up to support at least two EVs someday. In other words, these are long-term investments, poised to grow over decades—hardly some run-of-the-mill food processing plant.
It’s why, as NC Newsline reported recently, the state is due to receive $3.5 billion in funding from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for a litany of manufacturing projects including EVs.
Despite all the EV interest, North Carolina is very much a purple state. Its liberal, blue metropolises are surrounded by conservative, rural localities. The amalgamation of regions has given the state an interesting voting history. In 2020, North Carolina voted for Republican Trump in the presidential election, Democrat Roy Cooper on the gubernatorial side, and a majority Republican rule in the state house and senate.
But Chung says the political differences have actually helped make the region more competitive. “Anytime you have two parties in control of two different branches, they're going to butt heads on certain policy disagreements,” Chung said. “Like everyone, no one can disagree that educating our people is a good thing to do, but they're going to have differences around what's the best way to do that.”
Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (under construction)
To improve and strengthen the state’s workforce, EV manufacturing simply happens to be a great avenue to do so. It’s advanced technology, and nobody can say “no” to getting these companies to relocate to North Carolina. Plus, some of these investments were implemented in deep red counties. Toyota’s battery manufacturing facility is in Randolph County, a locale with a 211% Republican voter advantage (as opposed to Democrats.)
“The more EVs are seen as job creators, the better they will do politically,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant and founder of the nonprofit EV Politics Project. “Congressmen fight like hell to keep local jobs.”
Positioning EVs as a way to accelerate the workforce, generate revenue, and “future-proof” the economy is one of the most effective ways to dismantle the political barrier.
“The politics of EVs are all tangled up because our country is so partisan,” Murphy said. “You’ve got to move the debate from the environmental stuff to jobs and competition with China.”
Less than two hours south of Raleigh and the situation gets even more complex. Volvo is adding at least 1,300 jobs to its Ridgeville, South Carolina plant just to make the electric EX90—a vehicle whose American production is even more important as Volvo’s parent company faces anti-China tariffs elsewhere. BMW’s famed Spartanburg plant, actually America’s largest car exporter, is getting a $1.7 billion investment for EV production and a battery assembly plant nearby. And Scout Motors is perhaps the biggest coup of all. It’s set to bring at least 4,000 jobs to the Blythewood area and become an ultra-important brand for the Volkswagen Group as it faces tremendous headwinds in Europe and China.

But there’s little doubt how South Carolina will vote next week. That state is heavily expected to tilt toward Trump, who has consistently promised to “terminate” what he falsely calls “Kamala’s insane EV mandate” while vowing to “rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”
So if he does, what happens to the money driving those investments now—not to mention future EV tax incentives that encourage people to buy those cars? They may well be on the chopping block, and it’s why the Biden White House is now scrambling to allocate as many of those funds as it can in case the election doesn’t go Harris’ way.
Legal experts and industry observers generally believe it’d take an act of Congress to repeal everything Trump says he wants to get rid of. But many of them also believe doing so would mean big setbacks for America in the EV race.
When it comes to governmental forces, there are industrial and regulatory policies, says Levi Tillemann, the author of The Great Race: The Global Quest For The Car Of The Future. Industrial policies “push” money and resources to a specific industry to help it grow. An example of this would be giving a tax break to an electric vehicle manufacturer for building a plant in the country. The other is regulatory policies. Regulatory policies “pull” industries up to certain standards through legal requirements. An example of this is the Clean Air Act, mandating catalytic converters.
“The state that's led all of these efforts has been California, and the reason for that is that California had special authorities granted to it under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “And so [California] created this, I would say, fairly straightforward, but also extremely innovative, synthetic market for zero-emission vehicle credits, where they had the mandate, and then they allowed people to buy and sell credits amongst themselves.”
The Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credit program was instrumental in Tesla’s path to success. It was an example of regulatory policy rewarding those who built clean vehicles like Tesla and fining those who didn’t. It also generated more EVs on the market. The Ford Focus Electric, Chevrolet Spark EV, and Volkswagen e-Golf are just a few vehicles that manufacturers were effectively forced to produce. Were these excellent EVs? Absolutely not, but they were nevertheless first steps that led to bigger things. And now that the U.S., Europe and Japan are scrambling to keep up with China’s advancements in the electric space, they need all the help they can get.
“So if you cut back on your industrial policy, or if you cut back on your regulatory policy, either one of those is going to have a pretty significant effect on the growth in EV manufacturing and the U.S. EV market,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “But if you hit both of them at the same time, then you could see a really significant slowdown.”
Taking an objective look at the industry, it’s clear that governmental efforts can help shape the EV industry. Manufacturing incentives can help steer companies to build in the USA and regulatory policy will require automakers to build more efficient vehicles. But what if someone like Trump is at the helm of these policies?
Trump and his vice presidential pick, JD Vance, have both expressed distaste for the IRA and its pro-EV policies. But more recently, the former president has opened up to a future of electric vehicles—with internal combustion engine vehicles still in the fray. At a rally in Georgia, Trump said, “I’m for electric cars, I have to be because [Tesla CEO Elon Musk] endorsed me very strongly.”
“I think the Trump thing is a little more complex than it looks like, but there's no doubt that he is less sympathetic to EV subsidies,” Murphy said. Even Musk seemed to agree on X, though his various companies have benefitted tremendously from subsidies and government contracts alike.
But even with the IRA in place now, it could be possible for a different administration to stall its implementation process. “I would expect dramatically more narrow interpretations of a variety of tax credits within the IRA. I think that there is a very good chance that the Trump administration would simply fail to administer certain programs,” Tillemann said. “They wouldn't appoint the necessary people or allocate the necessary resources in order to administer certain plants, certain programs that are important to innovation and to expanding EV manufacturing in the U.S.”
Can EV advocates count on Trump and Musk’s newfound bromance to change the calculus? That depends on who you ask.
“I do think that the alliance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could have some sort of strange upside for the environmental and electric vehicle communities,” Tillemann said. “I didn't think that it was going to have much of an impact, but Elon Musk has gone from being sort of a Trump-curious tech executive to Donald Trump's biggest fanboy, and Donald Trump is very easily swayed by people who flatter him and people who support him in various ways, whether rhetorically or financially.”
Murphy, the political consultant, said he saw things differently. “Elon's interests are not necessarily aligned with the EV industry. They're aligned with Tesla,” he said. “I would say a Trump presidency is likely to add a lot of friction to government-supported EVs, slowing things down, maybe going after the tax credits or the lease loophole that help dealers offset the price.”
BMW's Neue Klasse EVs. Its South Carolina plant is expected to make six EVs by the end of the decade.
So will a Trump Administration curtail EV growth and support, if it comes to pass? Surely his role would have some impact, but it’s too soon to say what precisely will happen. But here’s what we do know. Electric vehicle sales are steadily growing, states love electric vehicle jobs, and China is unrelenting with its technological progress.
As Ford, General Motors and others still grapple with making EVs and batteries profitably, it’s clear that there are growing pains on the path to electrification. Any assistance from Uncle Sam—not unlike the stiff tariffs keeping BYD and the like out of our market for now—would be greatly appreciated. And interestingly, both parties have supported protectionist measures against Chinese EVs in the form of tariffs.
“Laws are kind of like a coloring book,” Tillemann told InsideEVs. “You have all of these outlines, but then the Administration is responsible for filling in the colors. And depending on what colors you use, that picture is going to look very, very different at the end of the day.”

VW Dealers Call Scout Plans 'Salt In The Wound',https://insideevs.com/news/739302/vw-dealers-scout/,Volkswagen dealers aren't happy about Scout's direct-to-consumer retail plan. They're gearing up for a big fight.,2024-10-30 12:56:13,"Volkswagen dealers are gearing up for a fight. The company's U.S. retailers are livid over being cut out of VW's new Scout brand, which plans to sell its Terra and Traveler models directly to consumers. So a group of VW dealers is getting ready to challenge VW's plans in court and in state capitols, leveraging their deep connection to state governments, as new reporting from Automotive News details.
“To just show these new vehicles that would have fit very nicely into VW’s portfolio, it’s like rubbing salt in the wound here,” National Auto Dealers Association CEO Mike Stanton told Automotive News. “What’s really different about this is that we’ve got a brand, it’s owned by Volkswagen AG, that is going to compete directly with franchise dealers. That’s not OK.”
Most states bar car companies from directly competing with their own dealerships, and many bar direct sales altogether. Many states have made exceptions or have rules that allow companies like Tesla to sell there, given that it doesn't have any dealers to compete with. But even Tesla's company-owned stores required a decade-long legal battle in countless states, some of which still don't allow Tesla to operate stores. Scout thinks it can follow that model, but the VW connection could prove to be an issue. Many predicted this issue.
As Stanton's quote shows, one of the key arguments the dealers have on their side is that Scout will ""compete"" with VW dealers. That's explicitly against the law in many states. But Scout has two defenses. First, it is not VW. The company has stressed that is an independent company owned by VW. This holds some water. I mean, if Volkswagen bought Rivian, would it have to close its factory stores or sell them off to dealers? The truth is, we don't know, because this has never been tested. Laws require interpretation and application, and this is a gray area.

Another one: Does Scout really compete with Volkswagen? Will any potential buyer of a Volkswagen Toas gasoline compact crossover say, no, in fact, I'll get an electric pickup truck with a bench seat instead? Probably not. But will someone considering an Atlas Cross Sport decide instead to chance it on a more exciting looking EV? Maybe. It's not likely, but on a long enough timeline it'll happen. At the very least, Scout's existence will likely make Volkswagen think twice about pushing toward any more outdoorsy or truckish products. But again, that's not what Volkswagen makes here, anyway.
It's a tricky problem. Volkswagen can argue that a new brand should not have to abide by the franchise agreements of a separate brand owned by the same company. It's not like VW dealers all got the rights to sell Lamborghinis as soon as they acquired that brand. No, the fight here has a broader angle: Dealers are threatened by direct-to-consumer models, and have enshrined protections from them in many state laws. A company store model from your own parent brand is a death knell, especially when Volkswagen itself is in rough waters.
This probably won't be stealing Jetta buyers away from VW stores. But it could be an attractive upgrade for someone who wants a more interesting, more capable, electric Atlas alternative.
The dealers are certain to leverage their deep pocketbooks and deep state government connections. VW is going to take advantage of its even deeper pocketbook. The fight will be messy. As Stanton told Automotive News, the NADA is going to fight anywhere it can fight, using any argument it can make. ""Everything’s on the table right now,"" Stanton said.

Women Are Lagging Behind In EV Adoption: Study,https://insideevs.com/news/738642/gender-gap-in-bev-adoption/,"Women tend to be less familiar with EVs, and they have worse dealership experiences.",2024-10-24 13:20:45,"We’ve known for a short while now that the road to mass EV adoption has been fraught with roadblocks unrelated to the vehicles themselves. Now, we're hearing about another issue. A new study from the analytics and data firm Escalent found out the whole EV sphere is overwhelmingly male-dominated; Men make up 71% of EV owners and 74% of EV shoppers. That’s much higher than the average for all light-duty vehicles, where men are estimated to make up about 65% of the market.
It looks like the EV revolution is leaving many women behind. The answers why are both complicated and entirely unsurprising for any person who has ever bought a car from a dealership.
The study noticed that even the way that men and women research their future purchases is different. “Men are significantly more inclined to explore their options via online research (71% compared with 64% of women), videos (34% versus 27%), online forums (22% versus 15%) and vehicle-building tools on manufacturer websites (22% versus 17%),” the study said. By comparison, women the study surveyed rely on in-person experiences: 65% of women studied did test drives, compared to 60% of men. This in-person experience is the start of where women are getting left behind.
“To sort of overly simplify, men care about range and battery life. I mean, there are some other concerns in there, but those are the two big ones,” said K.C. Boyce, vice president of the Automotive & Mobility and Energy team via Zoom call. Boyce said that while the women the study surveyed certainly do care about the range or charging experience, they also tend to have more questions in general that go beyond just the vehicle powertrain specifics.
“[Women] tend also have a lot of other questions about the [vehicle ownership] experience broadly. Like, how do I install charging at home? What does that look like? Where do I charge when I'm out in public? Do you know if it is going to take longer? Is it going to cost more? What is, you know, depreciation look like on an EV? There is just of a lot more kicking the tires, if you will, that women are doing,” Boyce continued. And as readers tell us all the time, many conventional dealer employees aren't good at answering those questions. Some treat EVs as an afterthought.
Nikki Stern, Escalent’s senior insights manager of the Automotive & Mobility and Energy team, was quick to say that the in-person car-buying experience wasn’t just the only lynchpin to the BEV gender gap. After all, you can get an EV from a company like Tesla, which doesn't have traditional dealerships and tends to have better answers to common EV questions. So buying experience issues don't tell the full story.
“Women are much less familiar with the BEV powertrain than males are,” Stern said. Stern said that lack of familiarity has a trickle effect. The women the sturdy surveyed, as a whole were less familiar and weren't able to get the knowledge about the powertrain. Also, they were less likely to know someone who has a BEV. “When you're less familiar with a product, you tend to have lower opinions of it because you don't really know much about it,” said Stern. Stern also said that women the women surveyed tend to use the same brands and products they trust or use and buy things based on things they’ve heard from people they know. If the people in your circle aren’t exposed to EVs either, then, well, it’ll be hard to have a positive, informed opinion about EVs. The study showed that only 30% of women it surveyed were familiar with EVs, but that number was 55% for men.
As a whole, both Stern and Boyce said that there’s a real education problem for all genders when it when it comes to EVs. Most consumers don't have enough information to make a confident decision. Boyce said that as a whole, BEV shoppers want to know about battery life, driving range and cost of ownership. “[Shoppers] are getting information about it, but [shoppers] are saying, “yeah, not sure this gives me the warm fuzzies that [BEV ownership is] going to work for me,” said Boyce.
Stern insisted that to help close the gap, brands and dealerships need to understand what women’s EV concerns are, where women’s EV knowledge and familiarity are compared to men and figure out a way to ease those concerns and assist them in their buying process. Escalent’s study found that 38% of EV shoppers liked messaging that favored education compared to technology, environmental, practicality and emotional messaging.
Clearly, consumers of all sorts are in desperate want of clear and informative communication when it comes to buying an EV. And if the EV transition is going to work, it can't leave any of them behind.

There’s Enough Lithium In Arkansas For The World’s EVs. Extracting It Is The Issue,https://insideevs.com/news/738449/lithium-source-arkansas-evs/,A new study says there’s nine times more lithium in Arkansas than the projected need for EVs globally in 2030.,2024-10-23 13:30:00,"A massive source of lithium has been discovered in Arkansas which could shift the global production scales in the United States’ favor and establish a local supply chain that would no longer depend on countries like Australia and South America.
Lithium is a key product needed for rechargeable batteries of all kinds, including those that power electric vehicles–that’s why they’re called lithium-ion. So finding new sources is a big deal, especially when we’re talking about reserves so big they could satisfy the projected needs for the entire world’s EV batteries in 2030–at least nine times over.
According to a new study from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), there are anywhere between 5 to 19 million tons of lithium in southwestern Arkansas. To come up with these figures, researchers used a combination of water testing and machine learning. But here’s the kicker: extracting clean lithium out of there is difficult, time-consuming and possibly not very cost-effective.
More Stuff Like This
That’s because the massive lithium reserves are present brines located in a geological unit known as the Smackover Formation, the USGS said. These brines are high-salinity waters associated with deep salt deposits that can be traced back to an ancient sea.
Moreover, scientists are weary of how much lithium could be commercially extracted and warn that their estimates are exactly that: estimates.
“We estimate there is enough dissolved lithium present in that region to replace U.S. imports of lithium and more,” said Katherine Knierim, a hydrologist and the study’s principal researcher. “It is important to caution that these estimates are an in-place assessment. We have not estimated what is technically recoverable based on newer methods to extract lithium from brines.”
Incidentally, the same Smackover Formation is a historic site for oil and gas production where the salty, lithium-rich brine is brought to the surface as wastewater from these operations. This liquid can be processed to extract the precious chemical, but it’s not easy.
Traditionally, the brine would be left in ponds until the water evaporates and the lithium can be scooped up, but this is time-consuming and requires a lot of physical space for the ponds. Another faster method is called direct lithium extraction (DLE) which uses chemical solvents or filters to separate the lithium from the water, but the technique is still in its infancy and there are concerns about the potential toxic waste left behind.
ExxonMobil–yes, the American oil and gas juggernaut–is reportedly already working on tapping the huge lithium resources buried 10,000 feet under Arkansas’ surface. According to The New York Times, the company has already drilled exploratory wells in the state and plans to start production in 2027, with the ultimate goal of becoming a “leading” lithium supplier for electric vehicles. As reported by The Verge, the fossil fuel giant purchased drilling rights across 120,000 acres of land within the Smackover Formation in Arkansas.
The United States relies on imports for more than 25% of its lithium, so tapping this new source would be a global game-changer that would put America at the forefront of lithium production. Another lithium-rich brine source is California’s Salton Sea. Now we just need to extract it without making a mess.",Iulian Dnistran
Ford Is Paying Its Dealers To Order F-150 Lightning EVs. Here’s Why,https://insideevs.com/news/738093/ford-paying-dealers-f-150-lightning/,"Dealers can score up to $22,500.",2024-10-21 03:35:54,"Ford F-150 Lightning sales more than doubled in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, but the American automaker wants to move even more units. To do so, dealers will have to play ball, whether they like it or not. But Ford has something in store that’s sure to entice franchises: cash.
According to a bulletin sent to dealers seen by Cars Direct, Ford will pay its partners up to $22,500 to order new F-150 Lightning electric trucks from its Retail Replenishment Centers (RRC) which are meant to make distribution easier ahead of a big model year change.
Until November 15, Ford will pay dealers across the country $1,000 per unit when ordering an F-150 Lightning from a Retail Replenishment Center and not directly from the factory. If a dealer orders over nine units, the bonus is boosted to $1,500 per EV. The maximum is 15 units for a bonus of $22,500.
More Ford Stuff
The XLT, Flash, Lariat and Platinum trims are eligible for the program, with the Pro notably absent from the list–it’s already the cheapest version of the F-150 Lightning and it’s mostly intended for fleets.
Ford said in its letter that the program is meant “to further test the logistics and efficiencies of RRCs and to increase RRC engagement.” As a reminder, the company’s Retail Replenishment Centers were first detailed last year for dealers who were part of the now-defunct EV certification program. Their main purpose was to reduce the costs of selling EVs for franchise owners, all while giving them an incentive not to stock too many electric cars–fewer cars on the lot means less floor space is needed.
Ford’s delivery centers, which are similar to General Motors’ fulfillment centers, ship EVs to dealers within an average of seven days, according to Mike DeYoung, the automaker’s senior director of sales and advertising, quoted by Automotive News.
It’s worth noting that while dealers may benefit from manufacturer incentives, these won’t necessarily translate into savings for customers, so do your homework before ordering a new F-150 Lightning. That said, Ford is currently offering some pretty sweet deals for the all-electric F-150, such as 0% financing for 60 months and a free home charger, including installation.
In the first nine months, Ford sold 22,807 F-150 Lightning EVs, a year-over-year increase of 86%. Overall, the Dearborn-based automaker sold 67,689 electric vehicles from January to September, up 45% from last year’s 46,671 units.",Iulian Dnistran
Inside Europe's Plan To Hit Back At China With Affordable EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/737622/renault-europe-battery-stellantis-cm/,"Will it be enough?

A mix of high labor costs, shrinking markets across the world, uneven electric vehicle sales and tough new competition from China are working together to bedevil Europe's car companies. Any one of these issues would mean a serious headache for any automaker; together, they make for one of the more apocalyptic environments we've seen for these companies since perhaps the Great Recession.
But Europe's automakers do have a plan to fight back, and that's what we'll cover on today's Critical Materials news roundup. Also on deck: a look at the impact EVs will have on auto jobs, and why U.S. EV and battery investments are hardly slowing down.
Renault 5 E-Tech Electric 2024
I'm a bit ashamed to admit this but as an American, I don't really think about Renault all that much. (Sorry, everyone.) But I've been thinking more and more about the French automaker these days because its newest designs are absolutely fire: the new electric Renault 5, the new Renault 4 E-Tech and others have me wishing this brand would give the U.S. market another go.
Frankly, Renault is going to need all the firepower it can muster. Nearly all the European automakers—the Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and so on—are losing market share like crazy in China and their home turf at the same time. So at the 2024 Paris Motor Show, which commenced on Monday, those car companies shored up their defenses with new budget EVs.
Here's Bloomberg:
With drivers balking at the high cost of owning electric vehicles, Stellantis NV, Renault SA and Volkswagen AG plan to showcase their latest budget EVs at the biennial event that starts Monday. Their aim is to turn around a slump that started last year when governments began pulling back incentives to ditch combustion engines.
The stakes are high for the new models to succeed. Chinese rivals led by BYD Co. are gaining market share in the region with cheaper models. And if the European carmakers fail to sell more EVs, they’ll be on the hook for as much as €15 billion in fines for failing to meet stricter fleet emissions-reduction targets.
“The mood is not great around EVs right now — there’s not enough charging infrastructure, there’s volatility on price, but let’s see,” Renault Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo said. “We are really trying our best.”
Renault is at the forefront of the affordability push, unveiling plug-in models in Paris including the R4, which is expected to cost less than €35,000 ($38,269). It’s also showing off the new R5, a €25,000 electric version of a 1970s gasoline car that offered fuel-efficient transport during a time of soaring oil prices.
Other examples include Stellantis' new Chinese joint venture Leapmotor, the Skoda Elroq, some new electric Mini Coopers and so on.

As is the case in America, the overall car market is shrinking because people are fed up with high prices and high interest rates, so more affordable EVs like these are the right move for now. The problem is that China's automakers are making serious inroads into Europe too, and they're hardly just sitting back and letting the home team score some runs (or goals, I guess I should say, since this is Europe we're talking about):
BYD is bringing EVs and plug-in hybrids to Paris including mass-market models competing with the French and German cars as well as Tesla Inc.’s Model Y. In a bid to demonstrate its technology prowess, BYD also will be showcasing the Yangwang U8, a luxury SUV costing around 1 million yuan ($141,509).
Guangzhou-based Xpeng Inc., which has a partnership with Volkswagen, will present its upcoming P7+ sedan, a longer-wheelbase version of the €50,000 P7 that competes with more expensive mid-size models from BMW and Mercedes.
While manufacturers including Great Wall Motor Co. and Nio Inc. are absent from the show, a number of Chinese automakers have sent their staff to Paris to discuss potential partnerships, market entries and European production with local manufacturers and dealers.
And China still has a tight control over the part of EVs that matters the most: the batteries. Plus, it has the edge on labor costs, though we can't pretend that situation is all sunshine and rainbows.
Do Europe's automakers have a fighting chance here?

What do Donald Trump and Akio Toyoda have in common? At least one thing that I can think of: both are convinced that the move to EVs will have a disastrous impact on employment in the auto sector, which is a crucial part of any country's economy and certainly the global one. Toyoda seems to consider himself not only chairman of the world's largest automaker by volume but also the vanguard of Japan's auto sector and the millions it employs; Trump never passes up an opportunity to spread doom and gloom about EVs on the campaign trail.
It's no secret that EVs need fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles do. So how bad could the jobs impact really be? Right now, research points to ""maybe better, actually"" or ""a bit worse than now."" In other words, it depends on who you ask and how they culled their data. Here's The Detroit News:
But emerging research on the topic — including a new, first-of-its-kind study from the University of Michigan — suggests that vehicle manufacturing won't see the job losses EV skeptics have warned of, though the impacts will be mixed. The UM study suggests that building electric vehicles requires more labor — or in other words, more jobs — than gas-powered cars over a plant's first 15 years or more of making EVs.
""(R)apid widespread loss of employment at vehicle assembly plants is a smaller risk than many fear,"" the team of researchers led by Ph.D. engineers Omar Ahmed and Andrew Weng wrote. That finding, though there are important caveats, conflicts with Trump’s comments on the topic.
Analyses on other areas of the automotive supply chain, the UM team pointed out, suggest a wide range of job impacts. For manufacturing of battery cells poised to replace traditional gas-powered engines, two leading studies indicated there could be a jobs boom.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and McKinsey & Company estimated that battery cell manufacturing in an all-EV auto industry could represent 107,000 or 71,000 jobs, respectively. Those would be significant increases over the roughly 57,000 engine manufacturing jobs in the United States.
A third study from Argonne National Laboratory, however, suggested that battery cell manufacturing might only be responsible for 31,000 jobs in an all-EV market. Trump has played to fears of such a decline.
So the jury's kind of out, but I have a very hard time believing this will be some extinction event due to electrification alone; intense competition in this space (see above) is the far greater threat.
I also think that so much of the rhetoric around EVs ignores the jobs that are coming or are in play right now due to investments in this space, including and especially right here in America. To that end...
Pilot Travel Centers LLC, General Motors and EVgo charging station
Maybe some automakers are culling back their EV plans and delaying certain models as sales grow, but not at the level they expected in 2024. I tend to think of this as I do with artificial intelligence: the initial hype wave is over, and now the serious players are settling in for what will be a long war and not some overnight transformation.
But don't think investments in the space are slowing down. Not at all, and especially not in the U.S. Here's one example from Bloomberg again:
The Biden administration is poised to loan nearly $671 million to Aspen Aerogels Inc. to make a key component of electric car batteries in the election battleground state of Georgia.
The conditional financing, being announced Wednesday by the US Energy Department, will fund construction of a new manufacturing plant producing thermal barriers that help prevent battery fires. It’s part of President Joe Biden’s push to build a domestic supply chain for electric vehicles and the advanced batteries that power them.
“We are making sure that the supply side is made here in this country,” Jigar Shah, director of the Energy Department Loan Programs Office, said in an interview. “We have taken very seriously the onshoring of the entire supply chain.”
Or how today, a Canadian miner announced General Motors will contribute $625 million to a Nevada joint venture for battery-related materials for EVs and hybrids. Or how a Stellantis-backed Silicon Valley startup called Lyten will invest more than $1 billion into ""the world's first factory for lithium-sulfur batteries,"" also in Nevada.
The lists go on and on, and I think it's fascinating that we have three examples like that on one day. But don't think this technology is going anywhere; the alternative is that America lets China continue to take the lead it, and no sane person on the business or policy side in the U.S. wants that.
Renault 5 E-Tech Electric (2024): The exterior colors
I can't even remember the last time I saw a Renault on U.S. roads (perhaps this one possibly abandoned one I see in Manhattan from time to time) but in the last couple years, it's quietly upped its design game. As more Americans seek affordable EVs, I wish that new Renault 5 had a path to sales here. But between the battery issues and the tax incentive rules around local production, I'm certainly not holding my breath.
Your turn: what EVs do you wish were sold in your neck of the woods?

BMW Chief Says EU Must Cancel 2035 Gas Engine Ban,https://insideevs.com/news/737569/bmw-ceo-cancel-2035-fuel-ban-eu/,"BMW and Mini are doing pretty well on the EV front, so why is Oliver Zipse going down this road?",2024-10-16 03:59:39,"BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse said during this year’s Paris Motor Show that the European Union must cancel the upcoming 2035 ban on vehicles that emit carbon dioxide. In doing so, the German automaker’s chief added fuel to the fire that has been slowly burning in the EU ever since the Bloc approved its emission-cutting regulation last year.
The plan, which went into effect in April 2023, imposed a fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions limit of 95 grams of CO2/kilometer for new cars sold in the EU this year, while vans must not exceed 147 g CO2/km–values extracted from the outdated NEDC testing procedure. From 2025 to 2030, new cars must slot below 93.5 g CO2/km while the limit for vans goes up to 153.9 g CO2/km–but on the newer and stricter WLTP testing. However, the limits will get stricter after 2030, and from 2035, all new cars and vans sold in the EU must be emissions-free.
""A correction of the 100% BEV target for 2035 as part of a comprehensive CO2-reduction package would also afford European OEMs less reliance on China for batteries,"" Zipse said at the Paris Motor Show, quoted by Reuters. ""To maintain the successful course, a strictly technology-agnostic path within the policy framework is essential,"" he added.
More From Europe
In other words, BMW Group’s head honcho says the upcoming ban will only force Europe to rely even more on Chinese batteries for making electric vehicles–the vehicle category expected to almost completely replace combustion vehicles after 2035.
It’s worth noting that the EU regulation doesn’t ban gas or diesel vehicles outright, but rather forces automakers to come up with vehicles that don’t emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Fuel-cell vehicles and even e-fuel-powered cars will be allowed, but the infrastructure for these is extremely limited, as opposed to the EV charging infrastructure that is growing at a rapid pace.
Zipse said the mood in Europe was “trending towards one of pessimism” and that the region needed a new regulatory framework to remain competitive. The ban “could also threaten the European automotive industry in its heart,” he added. The regulation will “with today’s assumptions, lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole.”
BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse with the BMW i Vision Dee Concept
Chinese automakers, which–in case you weren’t paying attention–are gobbling up more and more market share in Europe, are exclusively focused on all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, often at very competitive prices. These cars sip less fuel–or none at all–and the long-term savings are significant compared to ICE vehicles.
Even with the recently approved import tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which will go into effect next year, automotive powerhouses like BYD are confident that if they play the long game, they can’t lose.
""We are now hearing that many companies are going back to combustion engine cars. But if the whole world switches to electric cars in five years, they will not be ready for it because they have not invested,"" said BYD President Stella Li said in an interview with a German newspaper. ""In the long term, that is very dangerous. It will kill these car manufacturers.""
The 2025 Mini Cooper SE is currently made in China by Spotlight Automotive, a joint venture between BMW Group and Great Wall Motor.
Sales of all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in Europe were down 4% in the first nine months of the year compared to 2023. All-electric cars, however, saw a steady 12% year-over-year increase in September, while PHEVs went down 12%, according to data from Rho Motion. Globally, BMW AG is doing well on the EV front, with 266,151 units sold in the first nine months, up 22.6% from last year.
But the bigger issues here are a slowing car market in general, with EU sales going down 18.3% in August, and the unpleasant prospect of paying billions of euros of fines if the emissions limits aren’t reached. This money could be otherwise invested in zero-emissions vehicles, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which, coincidentally or not, includes BMW Group.
This isn’t the first time someone opposed the carbon-slashing regulation in the EU. Volkswagen and Renault, as well as the Italian government, proposed that the CO2 targets be loosened or delayed. That hasn’t happened, though, so the limits will be enforced as per the law.",Iulian Dnistran
The Honda Prologue Is 2024's Surprise EV Success Story,https://insideevs.com/news/737314/honda-prologue-sales-q3-2024/,"It turns out people really wanted good electric cars from Honda, and the 296-mile Prologue EV is doing it for them.",2024-10-14 10:49:10,"You have to get up pretty early in the morning to outfox the Ford Mustang Mach-E. It's spent a few years now as one of America's top-selling electric vehicles that don't come from Tesla, and it took the top non-Tesla crown this year after the Chevrolet Bolt bowed out of the market. But now, and perhaps unexpectedly, an unlikely competitor is gaining fast on the Mach-E: the Honda Prologue.
The recent analysis of third-quarter U.S. electric vehicle sales data from Cox Automotive has some very interesting trend lines. One thing that stood out to us in particular was just how well the Prologue is doing in its first year on the market and as production really starts to ramp up.
According to the data, the Prologue became America's fifth best-selling EV in Q3, behind, in order, the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck and Mustang Mach-E. So for non-Tesla EV sales, that means the Prologue takes the silver medal. And with 12,644 Prologue sales in Q3, it was only off the Mach-E's numbers by 748 units.
Granted, the Mach-E will probably keep the non-Tesla leader status by the year's end because it's just been on sale in volume for much longer. But the fact that the Prologue is catching up so quickly to a hit like the Mach-E says a lot about how much people want good electric Hondas.
I'd also add that the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is no sales slouch either, and, in addition to being one of the best-spec'd EVs around, seemed like it could possibly take the non-Tesla sales leader position this year. But now it has tough competition too.
This is a nice outcome for Honda's first modern EV, but perhaps it's not too surprising. American car buyers still tend to equate Honda and Toyota with being ""green"" car companies since both were such pioneers in the hybrid arena (and still do very well sales-wise with electrified models.) This summer, we featured a survey that indicated Honda and Toyota were considered EV leaders in the U.S., despite both automakers being actually reluctant to embrace full electrification.
But clearly, people want good EVs from those brands; on the months when good deals and discounts could be found, Toyota's bZ4X showed massive growth. It's a clientele that wants dependable and reliable technology and is probably more inclined to ""green"" than fans of other car brands.
And the specs on the Prologue are pretty legitimate. With front- or dual-motor all-wheel-drive, up to 296 miles of range from its 85 kWh battery and a design that doesn't scream ""I'm an electric spaceship,"" Honda's EV crossover hits a lot of sweet spots for mainstream success. Honda is even throwing in a home EV charger and help with some installation costs on the Prologue, making it kind of a turnkey choice for people going electric for the first time.
Sure, underneath it actually uses General Motors' EV platform and batteries, but I'm not sure many customers know or even care. (And GM's Ultium platform is strong on its own, with electric sales from the American automaker showing serious gains too.)
Oh, and it has Apple CarPlay, unlike GM's EVs. No wonder it's doing well.
Honda 0 Series Prototype
The question now is what Honda's electric future will look like. It's cleat that while the GM-based Prologue is popular, it's also kind of a stopgap until Honda can get its in-house EV operations up and running. That includes huge battery and car production hubs in Ohio and Canada and a novel approach to EVs that aims to emphasize lighter weight, interior space and better tech. But we have questions about that approach too, like whether these next-generation Honda EVs will look as out there as the 0 Series Concepts that debuted at CES this year, and what it means if they launch with a more expensive flagship sedan.
With any luck, Honda will be able to deliver something that can capitalize on the Prologue's success. And as interesting as the 0 Series models could be, a moderately-priced, good-range family crossover may just be the proven play instead.

Tesla's Robotaxi Event Can Be A Win If It Brings Us What We Really Want,https://insideevs.com/news/736859/tesla-robotaxi-event-affordable-model/,Here's a hint: it's not actually the Robotaxi. It's what the EV market really wants.,2024-10-10 10:45:33,"There's an old Steve Jobs-ism that I think about a lot as we cover what's next in automotive technology: ""People don't know what they want until you show it to them."" And as Jobs himself admitted, that's a kind of derivative of something Henry Ford famously said as he sought to democratize the then-new automobile: ""If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would've told me a faster horse.""
Though they only apparently met once, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is certainly an admirer of the Apple co-founder—or at least, of his playbook. Today's ""We, Robot"" Tesla Robotaxi demo at a Hollywood studio in Burbank, California feels like the kind of show Apple would've put on at the peak of its cultural relevance.
But those famous quotes resonate another way, too: we don't really know if people want robotaxis and fully driverless cars yet. They do, however, very clearly want more affordable electric cars. And with any luck, Musk will give the world some long-awaited news on that front.
Put more directly, there is very little evidence right now that people are drawn to purchase certain cars over others because of their automated driving assistance systems. Whether it's General Motors' Super Cruise, Ford's BlueCruise or even Tesla's own Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, people generally check those boxes or get them with a purchase and say ""Huh, this is interesting."" They don't often seek those cars out because of those features. That's something we hear quite often anecdotally from EV owners and prospective ones.
It's also backed up by data. Research firm AutoPacific’s 2024 Future Attribute Demand Study indicates that autonomous driving aids, to say nothing of full autonomy, don't really drive car purchases: ""Despite a growing number of automakers offering hands-off semi-autonomous driving systems for use on highways, they’re not yet among the most demanded features by today’s vehicle shoppers,"" the study said. ""Rather, two simpler and more affordable safety-enhancing automated features have climbed their way into the top 10 most-wanted features list."" What people want instead, the study says, is more basic automated features like rain-sensing windshield wipers, cross-traffic alerts and automatic emergency braking.
Tesla FSD V12.4.1
That may also be because the vast majority of people, driving cars that are on average 13 years old in America, don't have much experience with systems like Super Cruise—to say nothing of full-blown robotaxis. Google's Waymo is objectively the leader in that field at this point, but even those cabs only run in three cities.
Let's put aside the questions of whether Tesla can actually deliver on this technology and pass countless regulatory hurdles after more than a decade of undelivered promises—and admittedly, those are huge things to put aside. When we do, it's clear that Musk is about to sell people on something don't know they want, and betting the farm on the idea that they will when they see it.
But we do know this for certain: people want more affordable electric cars.
The cost of entry is still one of the biggest barriers to going electric. It's true that new car prices have shot up globally since the pandemic, and that EV costs are generally higher still. In August, the average new electric car cost $56,575 before any tax incentives or discounts, according to Cox Automotive.
Now, that's changing fast, especially with a glut of new affordable EV options coming to market in the next few years. There's the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EUV, which could start around or below $30,000; the Kia EV3; whatever Ford's ""skunkworks"" program is cooking up; the Jeep Renegade, and a few others.
Tesla Cybercab Robotaxi teaser shots
So where's Tesla in that crowd? We really don't know. Musk has been back and forth on that one. Plans for a more affordable ""Model 2""—not an official name by any means—had been in the works for years. That vehicle, built in a new platform, was meant to push Tesla's cars into even more customers by being perhaps the most affordable new EV in the U.S. At one point, production of the affordable model was meant to start at Tesla's Texas factory in the second half of 2025.
But in April, sources within the company told Reuters that Musk put that plan on the back burner to focus on its robotaxis instead. Musk then said Reuters was ""lying,"" but followed up by saying that the next ""more affordable"" Tesla would not only be built in tandem with the robotaxi but be a mix of old and new platforms. Here's what we reported at the time:
“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” Tesla’s first-quarter earnings release said.
The company elaborated somewhat in Q2's earnings call release as well in July: “Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.”
So where that project stands now is unclear. Some have speculated that Tesla will pull a rabbit out of its hat and offer a truly new car that undercuts even the Model 3 and Model Y; others fear that it could be something like either of those with cloth seats. While Tesla has a great deal of its stock price riding on projecting ""success"" with its robotaxi demo, some analysts also want proof of life for cheaper future cars as well.
Tesla Model 2 rendering rear
“I'm looking for three vehicles (most are expecting two) and I believe we'll only hear production timing on the Model 2, which I expect to begin late in 2025,” wrote one analyst with Deepwater Asset Management, which invests in Tesla. “This timing is a few months later than what Elon's comments suggested on the June earnings call. The one wild card could be [that] the more affordable Model 2 is actually a stripped-down Model 3, which would be viewed as a negative by investors.""
It would be a negative for customers as well. Because let's face it: the Tesla brand could use a boost. Between Musk's becoming the most vocal booster of a presidential candidate half the country hates and its own aging lineup, Tesla's market share and public image are shrinking fast. Proving it's still truly in the game of making and selling cars, and not just ceding sales to General Motors and Hyundai, would be a needed boost for the brand and for Musk as well.
Maybe people really don't know what they want until they see it. But Tesla could score a win here by giving people what they do want.

More Tesla Executives Exit Ahead Of Robotaxi Debut,https://insideevs.com/news/736762/tesla-exodus-top-officials-leave/,"Last week, four top Tesla executives who directly reported to CEO Elon Musk announced their departures on LinkedIn.",2024-10-09 15:55:57,"Several high-ranking officials have left Tesla ahead of the much anticipated Robotaxi Day event on Thursday, according to multiple farewell posts on LinkedIn.
The exodus started with the departure of Nagesh Saldi last week, a long-time Tesla executive and the company's Chief Information Officer for the last six years, as Bloomberg reported. Saldi was invloved in building out Tesla's new data centers in Texas and New York. The data centers house ""supercomputer clusters"" which are supposedly critical in training the automaker's AI and self-driving systems.
On Oct. 1, Tesla's Director of Public Policy and Business Development Jos Dings announced in a LinkedIn post that he was resigning after spending nearly eight years at the company.
In the post, Dings said he contributed on things like automated driving regulations, clean vehicle and fuel credits and making European Superchargers more accessible. Business Insider was the first to report these departures.
Five days after that, Tesla's Global Vehicle Automation and Safety Policy Lead Marc Van Impe also said on LinkedIn that he was leaving after serving Tesla for over eight years.
Impe said he worked with regulators to move the needle on safety and autonomous vehicle legislation and regulations and also contributed to the Robotaxi project. He has since started a policy advisor role at SpaceX, Elon Musk's second largest company after Tesla.
The post capturing the challenging work culture at Tesla was written by David Zhang, the former Program Manager of the Model S, Model X, Roadster and Next Generation Vehicles.
Some of the moments he highlighted included ""rebuilding the cooling tube line in Reno overnight after a less than satisfactory 1 a.m. line walk with the boss"" and ""endless days and nights in the tent at Fremont, hand-building SX Refresh RC cars."" He told his followers last week that he was moving on.
This follows the departures of other top-level Tesla officials earlier this year when Musk laid off the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Some of them were re-hired and others went on to work for other firms.
This included Rebecca Tinuchi, Tesla's former senior director of charging, Drew Baglino, chief of battery development and Rohan Patel, global director of public policy and business development.
That means eight of Musk's top deputies who once reported directly to him have left the company over the past year. Now Tesla has only three executives in top leadership as per its corporate governance website: CEO Elon Musk, CFO Vaibhav Taneja and Tom Zhu, senior vice president of automotive.
All eyes are on Tesla this week as it prepares to reveal the highly-anticipated Robotaxi, a self-driving car Musk claims will revolutionize transportation with a low-cost taxi service akin to a mix of Uber and Airbnb.

GM Pushes On With The Key To Its EV Future: Profits,https://insideevs.com/news/736719/gm-ev-profits-cm/,"General Motors has good news on the EV front. Meanwhile, Volkswagen tries again and Honda hedges its bets.",2024-10-09 10:33:20,"As 2024 has dragged on, I've increasingly come to think that the electric vehicle transition is less about cars that plug into something and more about control over the energy future. That future is battery-powered—for home generators, mobile devices, grid power and much more beyond cars—and gaining control of the battery supply chain and battery costs is where car companies can lead the way. And General Motors is making some real progress on that front.
Today on our Critical Materials morning news roundup, we look at three so-called ""legacy"" carmakers and their approach to EVs: GM, Volkswagen and Honda. Let's dig in.
Chevy EV Lineup 2024
GM CEO Mary Barra promised that 2024 would be a kind of do-over year for its aggressive future electric car plans. After all, 2023 saw countless setbacks with battery production, software challenges and other headaches. I'd say that in the past couple of weeks alone, we've seen strong evidence that it's working: EV sales in Q3 alone topped 70,000, and at yesterday's Investor Day event, Barra and her team offered some promising news on the profit front.
""We believe our EV losses have peaked this year and we’re focused on significantly improving profitability next year,"" Barra said. She added that GM is aiming for ""positive variable profit"" in this quarter.
I'm very proud of InsideEVs' team coverage yesterday on all of this so I won't recap it all here. But I will stress that one of the biggest things keeping down EV adoption is how unprofitable they tend to be for automakers; they don't control much of the battery supply chain or production methods and batteries themselves continue to be costly. Now, both of those factors are changing fast, and GM appears to be leading the way. Here's CNBC's take:
The EV tailwinds are split between savings from increases in volume and lower costs, including for raw materials and battery production.
[GM CFO Paul Jacobson] said GM’s capital spend also is expected to be consistent in 2025 with this year. GM’s 2024 financial guidance includes anticipated capital spending of between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion.
GM has improved its EV variable profit by more than 30 points year over year through the third quarter, Jacobson said.
GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday the automaker is on pace to produce and wholesale about 200,000 EVs for North America in 2024, achieving profitability on a production, or contribution-margin basis, by the end of this year. That guidance is down from a prior target of 200,00 to 250,000 EVs, which had been lowered from as high as 300,000 units.
Also assisting GM’s earnings in 2025 are expected reductions to fixed costs, which have come down by $2 billion over the past two years net of depreciation and amortization, as well as relatively stable demand and incentive spend by the automaker.
By contrast, let's look at Ford. It's done some groundbreaking things with EVs over the past years. But the fact that sales aren't in the hundreds of thousands annually yet, and the fact that it continues to lose money on the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, led it to punt some plans back a few years and cancel one electric model entirely.
Either way, if you want more EVs, they have to make money. And even as GM revises some of its battery plans, it seems to be getting there.
Volkswagen brand CEO Thomas Schaefer with the Volkswagen ID. 2all Concept
At this point, I'm extremely skeptical of any automaker who says they'll have ""X number of EVs by Y year."" I can't even keep track of the claims Volkswagen alone has made on that front; here's an article from 2019 that promised 70 electric VW Group models by 2025. (That isn't happening.)
But this latest pledge seems somewhat more realistic. I can't find the original source interview from Germany's Auto Motor und Sport quite yet, but Reuters picked up a quote from VW brand CEO Thomas Schaefer that claims eight new EV models are on the way by 2027:
""We have to produce our vehicles profitably and put them on the road at affordable prices,"" the publication quoted him as saying. It also reported that the ID.2 small car model would be developed in 36 months instead of 50 months.
This was probably made as Schaefer debuted the new Volkswagen Tayron/Tiguan, which is kind of its bread and butter these days as it sorts out its EV strategy. As we've covered routinely this year, VW is facing a raft of challenges with labor costs, uneven demand for EVs and lower sales in Europe and China—not to mention competition with Chinese EV newcomers.
Honda Series 0 Prototype
Honda announced some very exciting things at its Tech Meeting event in Japan, which our own Kevin Williams covered extensively with more coming today. A lot of that involves new factories in the U.S. and Canada to produce this next generation of high-tech cars.
But Honda's not completely committed, or at least, is staying flexible, its CEO told Bloomberg:
Honda Motor Co. said it’s open to altering its electrification roadmap if demand for pure battery cars continues to wane, a sign the Japanese automaker may ultimately join international peers in walking back electric vehicle targets.
“There’s enough room to adjust the time line of establishing EV factories globally and change our strategy should things move in an unexpected direction,” Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe told investors at Honda’s technology day last week. That could include delaying setting up some battery production lines, he said.
But it's worth noting this aggressive R&D spend should yield technologies that can be deployed on all sorts of cars, including hybrids:
The company has also developed compact e-Axle systems, which combine motors and inverters, to make EVs more spacious, it said. It will also apply a new welding technology, which helps to make car frames lighter.
Here's hoping the company figures it out, because Japan Inc. so far doesn't look especially competitive as a long-term EV player.

AMG Boss Is Confident V-8 Buyers Will Switch To Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/735838/amg-confident-v8-buyers-switch-ev/,"The CEO says people have bought cars with eight cylinders not just for the engine, but also the technology.",2024-12-25 07:28:19,"After learning that AMG buyers will embrace four-cylinder hybrids like smartphones, the man in charge of Mercedes' performance division follows up with an equally controversial statement. Speaking with Britain's Autocar magazine, AMG CEO Michael Schiebe was highly confident that buyers will have no problems switching from a big ol' V-8 engine to electric.
""Customers who came to the brand because of the V-8 did not come because they just wanted to have a big engine. They came because they loved the technology that we put into the car. So when it comes to electric driving, I'm pretty sure they will jump into that new technology because it will be the latest and greatest that you can get.""
The gist of this statement is that AMG wants us to believe Affalterbach's clientele consists of people who prioritize technology. If the latest developments don't have a combustion engine, customers will apparently transition to EVs. Sooner or later, the ""one man, one engine philosophy"" will come to an end, and it looks as though Schiebe believes people won't hesitate to embrace EVs as long as it has the newest tech.
But the V-8 engine isn't dying anytime soon. AMG has promised it still has new eight-cylinder models in the works. A recent spy video indicates the CLE63 could be the next in line to get the V-8 treatment. Reports state that the top-tier CLE was supposed to have a downsized electrified powertrain but weak demand for the C63 has prompted AMG to change the engine late in the development stage.
Although exact sales figures for the C63 are not available, massive discounts in Germany indicate it's not exactly popular. The C63 is not the only AMG to lose its V-8 since the GLC63 has also dropped the twin-turbo 4.0-liter unit. In addition, Mercedes has already announced the next E63 won't have eight cylinders.
Referring to the plug-in hybrid 2.0-liter setup in a previous interview, Schiebe admitted some AMG customers ""take time to really be excited for the technology."" He went on to say that ""it's important to be open-minded when it comes to technology."" Looking further back, Schiebe defended the company's decision to put a four-banger in the C63 by saying its plug-in hybrid setup is ""very, very progressive.""
In AMG's defense, it is putting money where its mouth is. Not only has it launched several high-performance PHEVs, but it's also developing a bespoke electric car platform. The AMG.EA architecture has been several years in the making and Autocar understands a purely electric supercar is in the works. It'll apparently take after last year's Vision One-Eleven concept and should serve as a spiritual successor to the quad-motor 2013 SLS AMG Electric Drive.
AMG has already ruled out doing another F1-powered hypercar to follow up on the One because of increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Lower in the vast Mercedes lineup, there are still plenty of six- and eight-cylinder models, and even a massive V-12 in the Maybach S-Class.
Generally speaking, there's still time to buy a car with the right amount of cylinders but there are fewer and fewer options.

Even Toyota Knows The End Of Internal Combustion Is Near,https://insideevs.com/news/736270/toyota-end-of-ice/,"""There is a decision being made now as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,"" the company's chief scientist said.",2024-10-05 12:00:00,"Every company, whether it makes gadgets or home entertainment or software, wants its own technology to win. But it also has to go where the market is going. I'd say that's even tougher in the automotive world these days as global regulations push car companies toward a zero-emission future.
The world's largest automaker by production and sales volume, Toyota, gets this too. And even as it's been behind the curve on purely electric vehicles, its success with hybrids has it plotting the end of pure internal combustion.
Toyota's chief scientist admitted the company is discussing the end date for its non-electrified cars in America, he told Bloomberg this week.
“In the U.S., there is a decision being made now—and I’m not a part of it—as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,” Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist, told the outlet in an interview. “Just the fact that we’re thinking of that means that, OK, it must be close.”
That may come as a surprise to anyone who's passionate about Toyota's (admittedly very good) internal combustion engines, like the rowdy little three-cylinder in the GR Corolla or the almost-the-last-of-its-kind naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 in the Lexus IS 500 F Sport. But if you pay attention to Toyota's sales, you might realize this is the way things have been going for a while.
Toyota's track record with EVs hasn't been all that great. Its three electric offerings in the U.S. (if we count the related Subaru Solterra as well) are pretty outclassed in range, charging time and overall tech by competitors from the U.S., South Korea and Europe—to say nothing of the Chinese automakers that are leading the way.
But those electric models are still selling quite well, and especially, so are Toyota's hybrid models. Toyota pioneered hybrid tech and now has the biggest lineup of electrified cars of any automaker. In September, nearly half of its U.S. sales were EVs or hybrids. It's moved the ubiquitous Camry to an all-hybrid setup, meaning one of the few four-door sedans to still sell in any meaningful volume in America is now an electrified car.
For Toyota, that's the future. Not purely ICE vehicles. Company officials have hinted at times that the eventual plan is an all-hybrid-or-electric future in America, but this is one of the clearest admissions yet as to where things are going.
Pratt has been with Toyota for almost a decade now and is also the CEO of the Toyota Research Institute. Before that, he held leadership roles at the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and MIT. This is all to say that he's a smart guy and when he talks about climate matters, he knows what he's talking about. In that Bloomberg interview, he admits to being “thoroughly depressed” by the growing amount of CO2 emissions driven by human activity. “If you’re not scared by this curve, then you’re not seeing it right,” he said.
At the same time, Pratt has been a vocal proponent of Toyota's own skeptical approach to pure electrification as the future of cars. The automaker has instead argued for a ""multi-pathway"" approach with many different automotive powertrains depending on customer needs, whether those are hybrids, hydrogen vehicles or pure EVs. (It's also worth noting that, again, any company wants its technology to win. And two out of those three things have been driven by Toyota itself.)
There are two ways to look at that approach. The more critical one is that hydrogen power for passenger cars really isn't panning out so far and that hybrid vehicles, while much cleaner and more fuel-efficient than pure ICE ones, still generate carbon emissions, unlike EVs. But the other, perhaps more pragmatic way to look at it is that anything that takes pure ICE off the road is progress and that it's easier to get people into hybrids—for now, anyway—than it is to shift the entire market in a fully electric direction. Just this past week, Toyota said it would join other automakers in pushing back EV production in the U.S. amid concerns over uneven demand.
“What I’m trying to emphasize in my talks now is please, please, please, we all want the same thing, but let’s stop the wishful thinking,” Pratt said in that interview. “Let’s think about what really is going to occur, what human nature is like, what politics is like, the capital that folks don’t have to change their cars, and let’s find a way that accepts the reality of all those things, and let’s change what we actually can change.”
But I would say that no matter how you want to think of the evolution of car technology, the world's biggest automaker admitting that pure ICE has some kind of end date is a very big deal. In the near future, every Toyota for sale in the U.S. could be a hybrid, an EV or perhaps a hydrogen car. And that speaks volumes about where everything is going.

I’ve Been Running An EV Publication For A Year. Here’s What I’ve Learned,https://insideevs.com/news/735732/insideevs-2024-2024-recap-sales/,Transforming a society centered around gas-powered cars is proving harder than expected. And it requires thinking differently.,2024-10-03 15:35:55,"The concept of entrenchment has been on my mind a lot lately.
I have covered the auto industry as a journalist for more than a dozen years and have been a car enthusiast my entire life. Even so, I can truly say it’s hard to understand how entrenched the car industry is in modern society until you pay close attention to what happens when things start to change.
After a year at the helm of InsideEVs, I can see those fault lines more clearly than ever.
I'm grateful to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team of reporters, editors, video creators and contributors. 2024 isn't even over yet and it's been the wildest and most uneven year yet for the electric vehicle revolution, which to us feels both inevitable and also millions of miles away. We get more news to cover in a day than many publications get in a week.
But covering the EV shift must be like covering the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s; most people don't yet understand the magnitude of change we're all facing. What's going on right now isn't just ""cars that you plug in."" It's the rise of the battery economy and the war over who controls it. It's the transition from fossil fuels to a hopefully more sustainable future. It's automation, jobs and widespread economic upheaval. It's a software-driven transformation of how we'll get around someday, with all the good and terrifying things that entails.
I'm not even sure that the car companies can see all of that, either. That's because change is not a concept anyone is used to when it comes to cars.
The world as we know it today is built around the automobile. We have spent a century building a society where a car is an absolute necessity for daily living in most places. A sprawling ecosystem grew around that idea and in support of it: gas stations, highways, insurance providers, dealerships, repair shops, even suburbs. We have generally accepted as normal that a car purchase would be a normal part of life. Even if we don’t always see it, internal combustion touches almost every aspect of our lives.
Now, almost all of that is changing because it has to. Blame global air pollution or a looming showdown with China or just the inevitable march of technological progress. But the era of the EV is changing almost every part of how things have come to work.
Over the past year, I’ve seen every sort of reaction to those changes, from the car companies to consumers to the many institutions that support both. Some automakers are winning thanks to their forward-thinking embrace of what’s next; others are suffering because they realized going from 100 years of internal combustion to batteries and software is far harder than just saying you’re going to.
Lithium-Ion Battery Assembly
Millions of consumers are buying EVs in record numbers, albeit not as many as projected. Others curse the idea of being “forced” to go electric eventually. The dealers aren't happy, the parts suppliers worry for their future, the startups are figuring out how they're going to survive, and in America, much of what happens next may ride on what happens in the coming weeks.
I wanted to share a few major observations about our current moment. These are based on countless conversations with our readers—actual EV owners and prospective buyers—and people inside and around the auto industry, the public policy space, the tech sector and beyond. And from those conversations, a few big things keep coming up.
It’s actually rather unfortunate that the EV race is heating up in the era of 8% interest rates and record-high new car prices. Particularly during and after the pandemic, carmakers banked on the idea that people would just get used to paying $50,000 for family crossovers from now on.
Guess what? Squeezed out in every other area of their lives, they're now saying “No thanks.”
2026 Chevrolet Bolt EUV Rendering Rear
Even more so for the privilege of driving something more expensive that they didn’t understand and didn’t know how or where to “fill up.” (More on that later.) But when we ask people why they don’t want to go electric, “it’s too expensive” is one of the most common refrains we hear. And I certainly don’t blame them.
Hopefully, the next wave of cheaper models will change hearts and minds.
But let me put this as bluntly as I can: Everyone must now look at some of these car companies and ask, what is the point of you?
We now can tell the difference between the automakers whose leadership, engineers, designers and even rank-and-file folks are excited about EVs and the ones who are being dragged kicking and screaming into it by emissions and fuel economy rules.
It’s why so many automakers are freaked out by uneven electric sales. It’s an industry largely just used to people showing up like they always have. RAV4 owners buy more RAV4s. Silverado owners buy more Silverados. Much of the Nissan lineup feels like “the same car everyone else makes, except worse, but cheaper.” They’re not used to pitching a new, innovative product to a skeptical audience.
But I’d ask these same automakers what they’re actually doing to convince their customers of the real benefits of going electric. Until fairly recently, the move has been to toss them some Electrify America credits and let the dealers handle the rest, which they often didn’t.
As I started writing this, Ford announced it would hand out complementary Level 2 home chargers and cover most installation costs. That's the right way to play this. It's the kind of outside-the-box thinking they all need to be trying.
Education is key too. Car companies have been generally terrible at this in the EV era. Most people can’t explain how an internal combustion car works beyond “Gasoline goes here” and now they’re getting tossed into the deep end of a new world, one full of kilowatt-hours and charging curves and battery preconditioning.
2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Infotainment Review
I got an email a few weeks ago from a gentleman in his 80s who bought a Hyundai Ioniq 5 and did not know how to find fast charging with it. That’s a failure. I don't see a lot of effort to keep that sort of thing from happening again.
Put more bluntly, many of these car companies are just not going to survive this transition. Not if they can't commit to making the very best technology or offering the greatest value proposition while going the extra mile to educate consumers.
Many of them are failing to make cases for themselves—cases for why they’re really better than the competition that’s out there now and getting more intense each year. It’s hard to look at where things are going and feel good about Jaguar or half the Stellantis portfolio, let alone whether the world would be any worse off if those entities ceased to exist.
Like the good former city desk reporter that I am, I have a list of car company obituaries ready to go for when that day comes. The list is getting longer and longer. And if those companies can’t answer that question above, they’re probably on it.
There's perhaps no greater example of entrenchment than the group of people who have legally cemented themselves into America's new-car buying process and then collectively decided that they aren't down for what's next because it's expensive and hard and requires learning new things.
I can't say all car dealers are averse to selling EVs. Many are doing well on this front. But as a whole, and perhaps more importantly as a lobbying arm, they're going to be a bigger barrier to EV adoption than most people think. And the automakers get this, too; they just can't say anything publicly about their ""dealer partners.""
There are countless examples of this, like the 150-odd Cadillac dealers who cashed out rather than get ready to go electric or the challenges to Ford's EV sales plans or even how Hyundai's much-publicized Amazon pilot seems to be stuck in neutral.
Maybe things will start to change. Ford and GM seem intent on training those partners to get ready for what's next. And 32,195 GM Ultium-powered EVs don't just sell themselves in one quarter.
But if they don't, some big automaker is going to bring the hammer down, and the rest will follow suit when they do.
Entrenchment works both ways. Try reading our emails anytime InsideEVs writes about Apple CarPlay or Android Auto—specifically, the lack thereof in some new cars. People are furious about it and they simply will not buy cars that don’t have the smartphone mirroring systems.
Mercedes MBUX Apple CarPlay
Yes, in-car software is night and day better than it was even a few years ago. Try telling people that. Some two decades of dismal tech experiences have them clinging to what they know.
No automaker wants to cede the software future to the tech companies. But even if they really can find ways to become software giants on the same level as Apple and Google, I’m not sure they’ll ever be able to convince their customers to join them.
Mitsubishi i-MiEV Charging
Like the CEOs of General Motors and Ford, the continued knee-jerk reaction to EVs along partisan lines has surprised me too. Sure, our modern perception of EVs was born a decade ago from rich people in California driving Teslas. But in the end, it’s just technology. It doesn’t need to be partisan or inherently only for the politically left-leaning.
Considering that Florida and Texas are some of the top EV-adopting states behind California, I think plenty of people are starting to understand this too.
But there's been an upside to the prevalence of EVs in our wider national conversation: the rise in popularity of hybrid cars. The lack of charging infrastructure, or even the perception of it, is still the obvious barrier to EV adoption. In the meantime, people are waking up to the benefits of electrification with cars that are more familiar to their current lifestyle.
Nobody likes paying for gasoline. That isn't just going to be bad news for the fossil fuel industry; it already is.
A mere four years ago, probably 80% of the cars we write about daily on InsideEVs didn’t exist yet. The ones that did are now completely outclassed by modern EVs at range, charging times, software features and automated driving assistance tech.
I’ve never seen advancements happening at that rate in the car world before this.
I'm sometimes shocked when I hear things like GM claiming to have PHEVs available in the U.S. market by 2027. I wonder if they know that may as well be 50 years from now, the way things are going. That’s another aspect of this entrenchment thing: many of these companies, and their vast supplier networks, simply aren’t built to move that fast.
Again, it’s no wonder why. Things were always set up to work one way. Customers just showed up and everything else was just a fight over market share—battles over little things like design and features and horsepower, not owning the technologies that will define the future.
It’s not just the cars that are getting better. It’s the charging infrastructure too. People don’t often realize this, but charger growth in America alone is happening at an extremely rapid rate.
But there are two problems at work here. One is that chargers still aren’t getting built at the same rate as EV adoption, thanks to roadblocks around the installation of fast chargers and the fact that not enough is being done to get charging access to people who aren’t single-family homeowners.
The other problem is that this progress really depends on where you live. If you’re in New York, even New York City, things are night and day better than they were even a few years ago. In Nebraska or Idaho? Not so much, unfortunately.
Earlier this year, we launched a story series called EV Myths Discharged. The goal was to dive into some of the most pervasive misconceptions about electric cars out there, while still being factual and fair.
Running this series has been like trying to keep my basement from flooding with a tablespoon. There’s so much misinformation out there that it’s hard for us to keep up with. There are many reasons for this, from lies spreading on social media to intentional clickbait from so-called “traditional” news outlets to documented disinformation campaigns from Big Oil. The stories from ordinary EV drivers who are happy with their purchases get drowned out by the stories about extreme cases or straight-up lies.
Again, entrenchment. Gas cars are the norm, and any deviation from that is scary and worthy of hostility.
I’m also disappointed by the EV coverage I see from other outlets. While there are many thoughtful, well-researched, well-reported perspectives out there, much of what you see is rampant fanboyism, short-sighted “good quarter, bad quarter” financial reporting, or just open hostility from people who think owning a gas-powered car is, or should be, some kind of civil right.
Much of it ignores the fact that adoption of new technologies rarely happens on a straight, up-and-to-the-right line, or it neglects the environmental reasons behind the entire transition. Or fails to pay attention to the massive, massive amounts of investments still going into battery tech, new factories and software. I can’t predict the future more than anyone can. But I will say this: if you’re covering this world, make sure you don’t end up like this guy.
And no matter what happens, I'm always excited for what's next. It beats being bored at work every day.

Volvo Still Wants Europe To Ban Sales Of New Gas Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/735667/volvo-wants-new-gas-car-ban/,The CEO argues that going purely electric is the best way to cut emissions.,2024-12-25 07:28:21,"Volvo was among the first legacy automakers to announce the gradual demise of its combustion engines. As early as the beginning of 2021, it promised to go purely electric by the end of the decade. That's not happening anymore, but the Swedes insist Europe should still ban sales of new cars with gas engines by 2035.
Bloomberg got a hold of a declaration signed by Volvo and 49 other companies urging the European Union not to change the target. According to CEO Jim Rowan, the most efficient measure the automotive industry can take to reduce emissions on the continent is to ban sales of new ICE cars: ""Electrification is the single biggest action our industry can take to cut its carbon footprint.""
Volvo is not the only automaker on that shared declaration as Rivian also wants the EU to stick to its plan of abolishing gas and diesel cars by the middle of the next decade. Bloomberg points out other automakers refused to sign the declaration but other big names outside of the car manufacturing business did, including Uber and Ikea. Tesla isn't mentioned in the report, even though just like Rivian, it only sells EVs.
It's important to mention there's an asterisk next to that ban. The European Commission wants automakers to stop selling cars that generate harmful emissions, so ICE engines are not banned per se. In theory, that leaves the door open for new vehicles powered by combustion engines running on synthetic fuel or even hydrogen. Germany demanded this exemption, and the EC has pledged to elaborate a legal route for cars with combustion engines that run on carbon-neutral fuels to stick around after 2034.
In the meantime, Volvo has killed one important type of combustion engine and has promised to never bring it back. In late March, the last diesel car rolled off the assembly line. By 2030, plug-in hybrids with gasoline engines and purely electric vehicles are projected to account for 90-100% of total sales.
Six years from now, the Geely-owned brand believes only a ""limited number of mild hybrid models"" are still going to be around. PHEVs and EVs already represented 48% of shipments in the second quarter of the year, with Volvo estimating 50-60% for 2025.
At the beginning of the year, Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said the 2035 ban could be delayed. Earlier this month, Italy's Minister of the Environment and Energy Security declared ""the ban must be changed"" as the ""ideological vision"" has failed. Gilberto Pichetto Fratin added the proposed ban is ""absurd"" and that Europe ""needs a pragmatic vision."" His sentiments are echoed by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she believes the ban is ""self-destructive.""
Whatever happens in Europe, it will have global ramifications since the biggest players in the automotive industry develop and build cars on the continent. If a certain brand won't be allowed to sell its gas car from 2035, that company might not achieve the necessary economies of scale and could kill that ICE model globally.

European Automakers May Feel The Heat Amid Dockworkers Strike,https://insideevs.com/news/735919/dockworkers-strike-puts-european-brands-at-risk/,We also discuss Kia's plans to enter Japan and how Xpeng will fight the EU tariffs.,2024-10-02 11:26:00,"The auto industry is highly globalized. The Toyota, Tesla, Honda, Ford, Chevy or Hyundai you drive daily likely has parts manufactured across continents. This diverse supply chain helps automakers reduce costs and access expertise. But it's also vulnerable to any form of disruption, like tariffs, geopolitical tensions and what we're seeing this week: the dockworkers strike.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping up the world of electric cars, software defined vehicles and autonomous tech.
In other news, Kia plans to sell its futuristic-looking electric vans in Japan, where Hyundai Motor Group has struggled to capture even a tiny fraction of a market long dominated by homegrown behemoths. Meanwhile, Chinese automaker Xpeng has several options to tackle the European Union tariffs.
Automakers selling cars in the U.S. rely heavily on shipments arriving at the East and Gulf Coast ports. But the workers at these shipping ports are now on strike. It's their first big strike in nearly half a century, and Reuters has broken down how that could be detrimental to the economy and particularly to the auto industry.
The 45,000 port workers who went on strike this week are part of the International Longshoremen's Association union that is negotiating with the United States Maritime Alliance employer group for better wages and some assurance against automation impacting human jobs.
Experts say a few days of striking won't have huge impacts on the auto industry. But if it stretches up to a week or beyond, then automakers could feel the squeeze. That means fewer cars arriving at dealerships, fewer parts getting delivered for repair and maintenance and longer waiting times for consumers.
The strike could impact European carmakers for both exports and imports. Some experts went as far as calling this strike a ""tragedy.""
Here's more from Reuters:
""If (the strike) turns into weeks, it's going to be a tragedy,"" said Steve Hughes, CEO of HCS International, which advises the auto sector on shipping issues.
European automakers, many of which use the ports on strike, would be the most affected, Levy said in a research note.
""The European (automakers) lean heavily on Baltimore for imports and Southeastern ports (i.e. Charleston) for exports, as most of their U.S. production exposure is in this region,"" he said.
The news wire reported on Wednesday that BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo are all closely monitoring the situation as those premium brands rely heavily on shipments arriving from Europe. The strike might affect General Motors and Ford too, but less so compared to their European rivals.
In fact, GM and Ford vehicle imports are mostly routed through rail and truck from Canada and Mexico. So they may even stand to benefit from the strike as it can ease the pricing pressure if supply doesn't match demand and if more buyers looking at European EVs turn towards American carmakers.
Either way, if the strike continues, it would impact the record EV sales projection for 2024. Some automakers like GM and Hyundai Motor Group already reported a banger third quarter for EV sales. A prolonged strike could skew their production and sales targets for the remainder of the year.
Hyundai Motor Group has struggled for decades to penetrate the Japanese car market, which is dominated by Japanese giants like Toyota and Honda. According to Automotive News, Kia hasn't sold cars in Japan since 1990. Hyundai only reentered that market in 2022 after an unsuccessful stint in the aughts that forced it to pull out in 2009.
But remember the super cool commercial EVs that Kia revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show in January? Kia calls them Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV) models and those EVs, according to the brand, might be successful in Japan.
Kia will start its Japanese onslaught with the PV5 in 2026, followed by PV7 and more models later in the decade. It will partner with Tokyo-based trading company Sojitz Corporation for distribution.
They won't ride on the E-GMP platform that HMG's passenger EVs use. They will ride on a dedicated commercial EV platform instead that allows bidirectional charging, DC fast charging at up to 150 kilowatts for a 10 to 80% charge in 30 minutes and an estimated battery capacity of 80-100 kilowatt-hours.
Whoever purchases the Kia PBVs will have access to a high degree of customization, like various seating layouts, luggage compartment shapes, door options, battery capacities and more.
Rivian proved with its Amazon EDVs that delivery drivers deserve to have a better day at work with spacious, feature-rich cabins and also look cool while doing so. Other automakers seem to agree and are now offering their versions of what they think are cool, modern and futuristic electric vans.
Just like BYD, Geely and SAIC, Xpeng has big plans to expand its electric car business in Europe. Despite the looming tariffs on Chinese-made electric car imports, Xpeng won't back down.
The Guangzhou-based automaker that Volkswagen has a 5% stake in, plans to have several options on the table to sidestep the EU tariffs.
Here's more from Bloomberg:
“We’re looking at multiple options, ranging from contract manufacturing to working with existing plants, or even thinking about [new] plants,” Vice Chairman and Co-President Brian Gu said in a Bloomberg TV interview from Berlin on Wednesday. “But those are still very preliminary.”
EU members will vote on Friday to finalize the definitive tariffs on Chinese EVs—as high as 45%. The only way the tariffs don't come into effect is if 65% of the member states, or about 15 countries, vote against the tariffs.
The price war in China is forcing many local players to expand overseas. While that puts automakers at risk as geopolitical tensions remain high, it can ultimately be good news for consumers. If Chinese automakers do expand with European or North American plans, the increased competition should ultimately benefit consumers.
If the dockworkers' strike goes on for a while, it could be a real test of the resilience of America's auto industry, which is already undergoing a massive disruption amid the bumpy rise of electric cars.
Is this another major sign for U.S. automakers to bring production home and localize supply chains even further to develop flexibility and immunity to sudden disruptions? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Toyota Drops Meaningless Name For Plug-In Hybrids,https://www.motor1.com/news/735224/toyota-drops-prime-name/,"The ""Prime"" nameplate is dead. From now on, Toyota will just call them plug-in hybrids. As it should be.",2024-12-25 07:28:22,"""Prime"" is dead. Toyota announced on Thursday that its naming scheme for plug-in hybrid trims of the RAV4 and Prius has been dropped. Instead, the cars will be called the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. As it should be.
The Prime name first appeared in 2017 with the introduction of the Prius Prime, based on the then-new fourth-generation Prius. The first RAV4 Prime appeared in 2019, making headlines with its combined 302 horsepower and claimed 5.5-second 0-60 time.
""The switch to the RAV4 Plug-in name is intended to help consumers more easily identify the powertrain choices among RAV4 models,"" Toyota said in a statement. ""In addition to the model naming change, the Toyota logo on the front and rear of the vehicle will no longer have a blue “halo” within.""
The Prime name might've sounded cool, but it made things tough for normal shoppers who just wanted to know what they were getting. This switch will make it far easier for people to understand the differences in powertrain offerings without having to load up Google on their phones.
Aside from the badging switch-up, the RAV4 Plug-In continues into 2025 with no changes. That means standard all-wheel drive, an estimated 42 miles of all-electric range, and a combined 38 mpg when in hybrid mode.
The 2025 Prius Plug-in Hybrid continues similarly, with the same 220 hp as last year's Prime model, 44 miles of electric driving range, and up to 52 mpg combined, depending on wheel size.

Anti-China EV Policies Won't Protect America Forever,https://insideevs.com/news/735092/china-tariff-panel-critical-materials/,"Or rather, America's auto industry, experts say. For now, tariffs buy time. ""Then the question is, what will we do with our time?""",2024-09-25 11:14:08,"You may look at the auto industry's current chaos in Europe and think that those problems won't come to America. That this country is now taking aggressive steps to protect its auto market with 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs or a software ban that will effectively prohibit those cars from being sold here entirely. From that, you may think that it's all problem solved—the U.S. keeps new players from China out for good.
But the truth is that these protectionist measures are temporary at best, and even the auto industry seems to get it. Or at least, the smart folks in the business do.
That leads off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and industry news. Also on tap today: Hyundai's online sales program with Amazon seems to hit the skids, and another reminder that China's auto industry is strong, but not invincible. Let's dig in.
BYD Seagull Takes Over The World
This week, the U.S. government instituted some of its toughest moves yet to keep Chinese cars from pouring into the U.S. market. Officially, the bans that will go into effect later this decade are predicated on national security: keeping high-tech, connected, camera-equipped cars from potentially spying or collecting sensitive data on citizens.
While U.S. Department of Commerce officials say the measures aren't related to any other anti-China policy actions, like the earlier tariffs, it's easy to see what's really going on here. And that's a plan to at the very least help the U.S. automakers (and ones operating here, like Toyota and the rest) to buy time to build cars that can compete with China.
That was the vibe on a panel yesterday at the Automotive News Congress in Detroit:
""This industry here in the United States should not think that this is going to be here forever,"" said John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, at the conference in Pontiac, Mich., a suburb of Detroit. ""Then the question is, what will we do with our time?""
The moves are aimed at addressing national security concerns and boosting the competitiveness of the North American auto industry in the face of the threat of imported, inexpensive Chinese EVs flooding the market.
They're unlikely to keep Chinese automakers out of the region for long, as companies such as BYD eye Mexico as a location to open an assembly plant, AutoForecast Solutions CEO Joe McCabe said. But they do give companies in the region the ability to become more competitive by building back brand loyalty and addressing issues such as range anxiety and the high cost of new EVs, he said.
""This gives us time for manufacturers to not be complacent,"" McCabe said. ""If you build here, get competitive.""
The North American auto industry cannot directly compete for long with the enormous subsidies Chinese automakers receive from China's government, but tariffs and federal incentives provide the region with an ""amazing buffer"" to create more products that can go toe-to-toe with them, said Kate Kalutkiewicz, senior managing director at McLarty Associates.
They're all correct here. China has a big lead on two things: batteries and software. The first is because countries like the U.S. spent decades outsourcing to China and China spent the same amount of time cornering the market on the entire battery supply chain. It's one huge reason why so many U.S. EVs are massive money-losers: no ownership of those battery costs. The country is also a leader in-car software, as its EV makers have fully committed to the ""software-defined vehicle"" strategy that Tesla pioneered. Couple those advantages with extremely cheap labor costs (and often questionable labor practices, to put it diplomatically) and you get a recipe for cars that can outclass and undercut ours by a significant margin.
But if these automakers are shut out of the U.S. for a few years, that in theory gives our car companies—and the country as a whole—time to build up the local supply chain, get better at making EVs and up their collective software game.
Now the big question is: Can they?
I've been wondering what's been happening with Hyundai's groundbreaking plan to sell cars (with the help of local dealers, of course) on Amazon. That was announced at last year's Los Angeles Auto Show, and save for a small pilot program only for Amazon employees, it hasn't seen much of a wider rollout.
Now we sort of know more, also thanks to an Automotive News Congress panel event:
Auto dealers are frustrated at the lack of progress in Hyundai's plans to sell its full portfolio of vehicles on the Amazon shopping platform, said Mike Stanton, CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
""Amazon announced this about a year ago and they're still not out of pilot,"" Stanton said at a Sept. 24 retail-focused panel discussion held at the Automotive News Congress in Pontiac, Mich. One of the main topics was direct-to-consumer versus dealership distribution models.
""What I am hearing right now is that the dealers are frustrated,"" Stanton said. ""They're not there yet with the agreement. It appears to be another digital retailing tool at the moment and probably not top tier.""
For example:
""When you look at our whole ecosystem of vendors that we work with ... we need these partners to make sure that we can deliver on that experience,"" Stanton said.
He said he believes Amazon understands the complexity of how the car-selling process works, but the partnership pilot still has a lot more work to go.
""They still haven't set up a situation where the dealer can deal with multiple banks or work on trades, so I think more will come,"" Stanton said.
We're working on learning more about this situation, but some of that makes sense. We anticipated some dealer resistance to the idea of online car-shopping, since some of them could see the move as laying the groundwork to eliminate them from the sales process. That would take major legal overhauls, however, since the car dealer franchise system is cemented into new car sales laws in many states.
Hyundai won't ever say this, but I get the sense the Amazon move happened over some frustration with the fact that it now makes world-class EVs but has a U.S. dealer network with a bit of a... reputation, let's just say. (All the time, we hear from prospective Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 buyers who encounter nightmare scenarios at car-buying time.) It sounds like both sides have things to figure out if this program is to move past the pilot stage.
China Dealer
Don't think the Chinese auto industry is some unstoppable juggernaut. After decades of explosive growth, the country's economy is slowing down and the huge field of car brands is starting to narrow. Here's Bloomberg on Chinese auto dealers feeling the sting:
Car dealerships across China are facing losses of almost $20 billion as consumers hold off on making major purchases and vehicles pile up in sales lots.
The country’s car retailers are experiencing “extremely intense liquidity” and looking at losses of about 138 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) for the first eight months of 2024 alone, the China Automobile Dealers Association said in a statement Monday.
While sales of new-energy vehicles in China are relatively strong, retail passenger car sales overall are more muted, expected to rise just 4% year-on-year in September, China’s Passenger Car Association said last week. Government subsidies encouraging drivers to trade in older cars are largely responsible for the NEV sales surge but dealerships are hurting due to the industry’s continued price war.
Instead, they're relying heavily on discounts to move metal, but inventory is still piling up. Sound familiar?
NIO ET7 customer deliveries kicked off in China on March 28
Let's say you're in charge of U.S. policy to help the auto industry—which, by the way, adds some $600 billion to our GDP and employs millions of people—keep up with China. What do you do? No wrong ideas here, let's brainstorm.

Nissan's Nismo Won't Go Fully Electric,https://www.motor1.com/news/734968/nissan-nismo-fully-electric/,Chaotic EV growth has forced Nissan's performance brand to adjust.,2024-12-25 07:28:23,"If you've been worried that Nissan's high-performance Nismo division will be going fully electric, we have some good news. In a recent interview, Pierre Loing, Nissan's global product boss, said, ""Nismo has no specific target to go electric only.""
Loing told Top Gear magazine that EV growth has been chaotic, and ""our role as a manufacturer is to adjust."" The company is focusing on its E-Power powertrain, which uses the gasoline engine as a battery generator. Nissan launched the Qashqai E-Power in 2022, the first model to feature the new setup and any Nismo plans depend on the specific model. Over half of the Qashqai's sold in Europe have E-Power.
Nissan knows a car like the GT-R can command a far higher price for a Nismo offering than a model like the Ariya. Loing admits the Ariya isn't a cheap EV, so the price ceiling can't reach ""a super high level,"" which ultimately depends on the model. A Nismo package has to fit the product, and any expansion will need strong sales to justify its existence.
Automakers across the board are reconsidering their electric vehicle plans in the face of inconsistent growth. Many are tempering their ambitious roadmaps, pushing back EV launches while focusing on growing their hybrid lineups. It indicates how quickly consumer trends can change and how nimble automakers have had to adjust.
Loing said that if you'd asked him about the company's EV plans a few years ago, he would have ""given a different answer."" Hopefully, the next few years won't force the automaker to set a new timeline to fully electrify the Nismo line.

A $1 Billion Fund Aims To Revitalize America's EV Suppliers,https://insideevs.com/news/734860/one-billion-ev-fund-small-auto-suppliers/,A government-backed $1 billion fund hopes to help small auto suppliers embrace EVs.,2024-09-23 17:30:08,"As the U.S. prepares to move its electric vehicle supply-chain away from China with tariffs on Chinese-made EVs and a proposed ban on Chinese and Russian software and hardware, it's also boosting support for its homegrown EV supply-chain network.
Chicago-based investment firm Monroe Capital today announced plans to raise $1 billion to facilitate loans for small- and medium-sized auto suppliers. The White House lauded the announcement, saying the fund aims to help small auto businesses make the tough transition towards EVs.
The Drive Forward fund, as Monroe Capital calls it, would be a ""government-guaranteed"" scheme to help smaller suppliers embrace electrification and diversify their businesses away from gas cars.
""A focus will be placed on manufacturers that are well-positioned to lead in the future of the automotive industry and need additional capital and support to grow their manufacturing capacity,"" the White House said in a statement.
Auto suppliers have an outsized role in the transition towards electrification as they employ more than 250,000 workers across the country, including in Michigan, Ohio and other parts of the nation, the White House added.
They're the backbone of the shift to EVs but have struggled so far. They need to retrain their workforce, retool plants, navigate parts shortages and on top of all that, help automakers comply with tough new EPA emissions rules that will kickstart in 2027.
Without a financial shot in the arm from the government, it would be tough. The White House added that the support would go to ""companies making critical investments in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) production to electric vehicles (EV).""
This is in addition to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's $9.1 million grant to establish the Michigan Auto Supplier Transition Program to help the state's small businesses embrace EVs.
The announcements for local support for EVs comes in the wake of the Commerce Department's latest proposal to ban Chinese and Russian software in cars sold in the U.S. from 2027 and hardware from 2030.
The U.S. believes that software and hardware with links to China or Russia, such as vehicle connectivity systems, cellular and WiFi network and advanced driver assistance systems pose a national security risk.
If the ban is finalized, the prospect of Chinese EVs ever landing on U.S. shores would get even slimmer.

General Motors' CEO 'Surprised' EVs Have Become Political,https://insideevs.com/news/734720/mary-barra-politics-cm-election/,"Plus, Nissan discovers an exciting new technology called ""plug-in hybrids"" and there may be a silver lining to South Korea's EV fire scare.",2024-09-23 10:00:11,"Here in America, we invent all kinds of new and fantastic ways to get mad about the things we see on cable news. For approximately half the country, electric vehicles are one of those things. People are mad that they might be ""forced"" into buying EVs, and even if that's not actually the case, even the CEO of General Motors admits she's been caught off guard by the backlash.
GM CEO Mary Barra's latest comments on the EV race headline this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and auto industry news. We'll also look at Nissan's new plug-in hybrid plans and why South Korea's recent EV battery fire scare may even have an upside.
GM CEO Mary Barra with the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV
I have to hand it to Barra: I think she struck the right tone during an interview on CBS' Sunday Morning this past weekend. GM has actually been having a pretty good do-over year for EVs: it's been launching new models like the Equinox EV and several upcoming electric Cadillacs, all while preparing for the reboot of the Bolt EUV next year. And Tesla's Supercharger network just opened up to GM's EVs last week with the use of a new adapter.
But GM certainly hasn't been immune to the headwinds of the EV sector, mainly that sales haven't taken off as quickly as they and other automakers expected. (And increasingly, I wonder what it was they all seemed to expect.) Barra admitted earlier this year that GM won't hit a previous goal of 1 million EVs sold by 2025 and that it will delay several new models and factories as it waits for the market to ""develop.""
As disappointing as that is, Barra at least reaffirmed the overall goal on CBS:
But it was her promise three years ago to stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2035 – and GM's ability to live up to it – that will likely define her legacy.
Asked if she anticipates GM will be all-electric by 2035, Barra replied, ""For our light-duty vehicles, yes. We'll be guided by the consumer, but the plans that we have in place will get us there."" Nonetheless, in the face of slowing EV sales, Barra said, ""I don't think we ever thought it was gonna be linear.""
The ""light duty"" caveat, which has been used before, is interesting. GM seems to be as skeptical of the electric heavy-duty work truck as Ford is—and I'm fairly unconvinced on giant, 200 kWh batteries for trucks too—but that's just me reading the lines there.
But Barra's also in a tough spot because she's seeking to get more customers for very mainstream American brands like Chevrolet and GMC into EVs. I don't mean to generalize too much, but that's a very different customer base than Rivian or Tesla, and the politicization of EVs may be tougher for GM to navigate. It certainly caught Barra by surprise:
Barra was surprised that EVs have become a political issue: ""I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be,"" she said. ""Again, I think one of the strengths of General Motors is we're giving people choice. We're not telling you what you have to have. We're saying, if you want this, we have it.""
Then again, the Bolt EV and EUV were the top-selling U.S. EVs that weren't Teslas in 2023. If you build it, and it's cheap enough and good enough, they will come.

If you believe in an electrified future, there are reasons to be optimistic about GM these days. Less so for Nissan, which blew an early lead in the EV race to keep making anodyne-looking gas cars powered by engines that they were running when I was in high school. (Which was over 20 years ago, for context.)
While the staying power of the VQ35 family of V6 engines is certainly a master class in cost amortization, Nissan does feel quite behind the curve on its powertrain strategy. It sells one EV in the U.S. and no hybrids here. But it is planning to join GM in offering some plug-in hybrids in the back half of this decade, Nikkei Asia reports.
Like the rest of the auto industry in Japan, a country that struggles with scarce natural resources and has a challenged relationship with electricity generation, Nissan has lagged on cars with plugs. Even Toyota's PHEV sales are drop in the bucket compared to conventional hybrids. But Nissan may soon lean on partners at Mitsubishi to get properly in the PHEV game:
Nissan Motor plans to develop its own plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, preparing to reach the market as soon as the late 2020s, Nikkei has learned, and also is considering having partner company Mitsubishi Motors supply PHEVs to Honda Motor, which does not offer that type of vehicle in the Japanese market.
As sales of fully electric vehicles stall globally amid high prices, Nissan sees highly profitable PHEVs as an important bridge to the time EVs achieve wide adoption.
Sales are rising for PHEVs, which combine an electric motor with a conventional fuel-powered engine. General Motors also has begun to consider developing plug-in hybrids for the U.S. market.
Electric vehicles are broadly classified into EVs, PHEVs and hybrids. These environmentally friendly autos emit less carbon dioxide than cars powered solely by petrochemicals.
PHEVs have a longer driving range than EVs because they also carry an engine. Unlike hybrids, they can be charged from household electrical outlets. Despite offering the advantages of both technologies, Japanese PHEVs have been limited to a few models offered by Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Motors.
Then again, Nissan has made big promises on EVs before, and the late 2020s may as well be 500 years away considering how fast the tech market moves—and how far ahead China is all sorts of plug-in cars.
South Korea EV Fires
Meanwhile in South Korea, a country that is quite advanced at EVs, a recent spate of underground parking garage fires has buyers on edge. Sales of EVs are now plummeting there, while they had been on the rise before this.
However, the Korean government seems to be acting swiftly to reassure car buyers that EVs are safe, and it has enacted groundbreaking rules around battery sourcing transparency. Bloomberg's Heesu Lee, based in Seoul and an EV owner herself, manages to find an upside here:
With the investigation still underway and the cause of the Mercedes fire yet to be identified, some carmakers, including Hyundai, General Motors and Porsche have taken the matter into their own hands by voluntarily disclosing their battery suppliers and offering free safety inspections to EV owners.
The government has also pledged to strengthen safety measures in parking lots and require more EV makers and battery charging operators to have adequate insurance cover. Whether those measures are enough to calm the unease around EVs is yet to be seen. As for me, I’m content to keep driving my EV.
And the flip side of risk is opportunity. If South Korea pushes forward and ends up with effective and comprehensive regulations in place, it could be a chance for the country to build a more resilient environment for EVs in the future.
And it could serve as an example for the rest of the world.
2026 Chevrolet Bolt Rendered
If you're GM, how do you get past the knee-jerk anti-EV politics that are out there? I'll say it again: people want a good deal. Give them something really affordable and also means they'll never have to pay for gasoline again and just see how fast they lose any misconceptions.
It's just technology, folks. It doesn't need to get political.

The Electronics Company Sharp Wants To Sell Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/734364/sharp-wants-sell-cars-by-2030/,This electric minivan has solar panels and a 65-inch display.,2024-12-25 07:28:25,"Just when you thought the automotive industry couldn't possibly get more crowded, another player wants to enter the game. To make it happen, TV maker Sharp intends to work with Foxconn, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer. It's better known as one of the companies that produces the iPhone. Their first joint effort is this. Say hello to the cute LDK+.
It's an EV with an adorably boxy shape and some neat features inside and out. The people-mover started in life as Foxconn's Model C crossover before being transformed for minivan duty. Sharp made the most of that massive roof by fitting solar panels to juice up the battery or power your home. There's a separate ""storage battery” to further take advantage of bidirectional charging by serving as an energy supply in case of emergencies such as a power outage caused by a natural phenomenon.
The cavernous interior is big enough to accommodate a massive 65-inch screen and rear seats that swivel. Sharp says the LDK+ uses artificial intelligence that gathers information from home appliances to adjust the AC and screen brightness. That massive display mounted at the back is not just for play as it can be used for a mobile office.
Technical specifications remain shrouded in mystery at this point. However, we do know the 2021 concept has since evolved into a production model that's already on sale in Taiwan as the Foxtron Model C. If you're unfamiliar with the name, Foxtron is a joint venture between Luxgen's parent company Yulon and Foxconn.
The road-going SUV has 231 horsepower, 250 pound-feet of torque, and 314 miles of range, albeit in the overly optimistic New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) cycle. The EV is 184.8 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 64 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 115 inches. That said, Sharp's electric minivan has different proportions. As for weight, the Foxtron Model C tips the scales at around 4,300 pounds.
Automotive News spoke with a Sharp official about the company’s ambitions to enter the automotive realm. Kazuma Naito, software development manager at Sharp’s Next Innovation branch, said the objective is to start selling cars by 2030. He admitted that the timeframe is currently a ""loose goal.""
With Foxconn owning a 66% controlling stake in Sharp, it's no surprise the two will collaborate again to bring EVs to the market by the decade's end. In the first phase, Sharp wants to sell electric cars at home in Japan, built domestically or somewhere else by Foxconn, potentially in China.
Sharp won't be the only tech giant from the Land of the Rising Sun to enter the car business in recent years. Sony has teamed up with Honda to launch an automotive joint venture called Sony Honda Mobility to bring the Afeela electric sedan to the market in 2025. An SUV is set to follow in 2027, with a cheaper compact model believed to debut in 2028 at the earliest.
Speaking of tech companies making cars, the long-rumored Apple Car was canceled back in February. That's despite an investment of more than $10 billion (yes, with a ""b"") over a decade, according to a recent report from The New York Times.

Chinese EVs Can Undercut American EVs Even With Tariffs,https://insideevs.com/news/734298/cheaper-chinese-evs-cm-tariff/,We also discuss how fast wireless charging is moving forward and why Stellantis is facing heat from UAW.,2024-09-18 11:37:20,"The bitter trade war between China and the West means we’re missing out on cheap, well-built Chinese EVs in the U.S. But when you're at the top of your game, tariffs can only sting so much.
Despite the hefty 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric cars, some of them can still undercut American-made EVs on price if there were to ever land on our shores.
Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily dose of news shaping up the world of electric cars, software defined vehicles and autonomous tech. Also on today's agenda: wireless charging for electric cars is inching closer to commercial reality and Stellantis is facing some heat from United Auto Workers (UAW), which plans to hold a strike authorization vote soon.
The U.S. Trade Representative said last week that Biden's punitive tariffs on electric cars will finally go into effect on September 27. That's after several delays and looming uncertainty over the continuation of the current EV policies—tax breaks for buyers, incentives for local factories and so on—as the November election approaches.
The tariffs intend to shield domestic automakers from a potential flood of affordable, high-quality Chinese EVs. But a new report from Japanese outlet Nikkei Asia reminds us that the tariffs, no matter how punitive, still have some limitations.
Here's what the report says:
In the U.S, not even front-runner Tesla has broken into the sub-$30,000 price range. There are no American EVs as cheap as gasoline-powered vehicles yet.
Joe McCabe, CEO of U.S. research company AutoForecast Solutions, said BYD's lowest price in the U.S. is $12,000. Even with a 100% tariff, BYD will have the cheapest EV in the market at under $25,000.
They may not be American, but there are some EVs that start at under $30,000 in the U.S., like the Nissan Leaf which costs a shade above $28,000 before taxes and fees. But it's true that EVs in the U.S. still aren't cheap, not without tax credits, lease and financing offers or the used market anyway.
That reminds of me of the $12,000 BYD Seagull, a fashionable little hatchback rocking Blade batteries and features from cars a segment above. If it hit U.S. shores, it would cost twice as that—but still undercut the Tesla Model 3s and Chevy Bolt EVs.
Sure, it's no range monster with its 39 kWh battery pack covering only 251 miles on the overly optimistic China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). But at that price, it would still offer value to users that don't munch miles all that often.
In China, the Seagull is so popular it’s edging out gas cars and speeding up the country’s already impressive EV revolution. It's gaining respect even internationally, as it was Japan's 2023 EV Of The Year.
The whole point of the tariffs is to allow America's homegrown industries some breathing room to build a BYD Seagull of our own, made in American factories, using American batteries and components.
But according to the report above, China argues that the tariffs only disrupts the global supply chains and won't really help the U.S. become competitive where it needs to be. Not without teaming up with Chinese car and battery makers anyway.
WiTricity’s Tesla Model 3 demo vehicle with WiTricity Halo wireless charging system
Wireless charging can be a small ergonomic improvement for your home. Just like your smartphone, you can come home after work, align your EV on a wireless charging pad and declutter the garage with fewer cables.
To be clear, the plugs and cables are not going anywhere. In fact, Level 2 and Level 3 charging infrastructure is only poised to grow in the U.S. But automakers see a business case for wireless charging.
In August, the Society of Automotive Engineers established the standard J2954 for wireless pads. Now a new report says that the technology is nearing commercial viability, with huge improvements in power density, efficiency and weight reduction. Plus, the standard would ensure that it works uniformly across brands.
So how does this exactly work? Instead of plugging in, you park over a special charging pad embedded in the ground. This pad transfers electricity to a receiver on the car using magnetic fields—a process called inductive charging.
When the car is aligned with the pad, the magnetic field is picked up by the car’s battery without cables. It's convenient because you don’t have to manually connect anything, but it’s generally slower than plugging in.
Here's more from Automotive News:
The J2954 standard, covering software and hardware, is based on technology developed by German supplier Mahle.
The company's Differential Inductive Positioning System uses a low-intensity magnetic field generated from coils in the ground charging pad that is picked up by coils in the charging equipment on the vehicle.
The system carries out a test to ensure the vehicle is aligned. SAE's Wireless Power Transfer team said the standard has demonstrated wireless charging up to 11 kW with 93 percent efficiency.
There's a lot of quiet development happening in this space. Volkswagen has already tested wireless charging on a Porsche Taycan. Tesla has already equipped the Cybertruck with a connector and a harness for an ""inductive charger."" And Hyundai and wireless charging company Witricity have been running tests in Korea.
There would be some obvious challenges, like making them durable and affordable. But it's pretty clear that this is not some classroom science project. The way things are moving, we could see this become a reality at some point in the future.
The UAW is threatening a potentially disruptive strike against Stellantis. The union plans to hold a strike authorization vote in the coming days, against what it call the automaker's failure to keep up with the industry and its own commitments made last year after a historic walkout.
As Reuters reported today, local Stellantis chapters have submitted grievances against Stellantis' alleged plan to move production of the Dodge Durango abroad—something the automaker has not confirmed yet.
The union also highlighted the Belvidere, Illinois assembly plant. The automaker closed that factory last year, leading to 1,200 workers losing their jobs. Stellantis committed to spending $1.5 billion to re-open the plant following negotiations with the UAW.
""It's not every day that we the auto workers are on the same side as the dealers, the same side as the suppliers and the same side as the shareholders,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. ""But today is that day, and we are prepared to take strike action to make Stellantis keep the promise.""
WiTricity’s Tesla Model 3 demo vehicle with WiTricity Halo wireless charging system
There's only one way to refuel a gas car: pull up, pump, and go. But the EV charging industry is still relatively young. It's still evolving, with no one-size-fits-all solution. That’s why the industry keeps innovating to make charging faster and hassle-free.
If wireless charging takes off, would you make the switch? Why do you think it might be better (or worse?) than your trusty Level 2 home charger? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Californians Are ‘Ashamed’ To Drive Teslas,https://insideevs.com/news/733956/tesla-sales-drop-in-silicon-valley/,"The Silicon Valley region once witnessed the highest adoption of Teslas. Now, people there are moving away from the brand.",2024-09-16 11:30:30,"Tesla sales and market share have declined for consecutive quarters this year and that trend is also reflecting certain parts of California, where Teslas have been historically popular, the most recent vehicle registration data suggests.
The first and second wave of Tesla buyers, especially in the Silicon Valley region, weren't just drawn to the brand's cool factor, but also its tech-forwardness and climate-conscious appeal. Now, experts suggest that rising competition and CEO Elon Musk’s shift toward far-right politics might be a drag on the brand.
Once Tesla's stronghold and the birthplace of its success, the region was a proving ground for a brand that made Musk the world’s richest man and accelerated the global shift to EVs. But now, Musk is undermining that very brand, tarnishing the empire he built.
According to S&P Mobility, Tesla registrations fell 22% between January and July in Santa Clara county, the heart of Silicon Valley. Meanwhile rivals saw 41% growth. Tesla alternatives have been soaring in popularity recently. Nationally, non-Tesla EV sales are up 33% in the first six months of this year, as per InsideEVs’ analysis of Cox Automotive data.
While the sales of Tesla's volume-sellers like the Model 3 and Model Y seem to be declining, the Cybertruck's production has ramped up significantly and it's now the best-selling electric truck in the U.S.
""It's unquestionable that this cloud of behavior has affected the brand,"" Mario Natarelli, managing partner at branding agency MBLM told Automotive News. ""Tesla was the EV leader, the most innovative, represented by a visionary… Now people are selling their Teslas, ashamed to even drive them because of the association with him.”
The list of Musk's controversies is endless. But here are some of the latest.
After the second assassination attempt on Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump yesterday, Musk questioned why there were no similar assassination attempts on President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris. After facing backlash, he deleted that post on X.
Musk is also donating $45 million per month to a pro-Trump Super PAC. In an interview with Trump last month, he said things like, “we shouldn’t vilify the oil and gas industry.” In the 24 hours after his interview with Trump, he tweeted 145 times, posting anti-immigrant content, election conspiracies and attacks against the media.
Data analytics firm CivicScience said that might be hurting the brand in a significant way.
In a survey of nearly 1,200 respondents familiar with Musk and Tesla, the majority of them said they were sensitive to a brand’s stance on social and political causes and were ‘somewhat’ likely to boycott a company based on the political leanings of its leader. However, those serious about buying Teslas are less affected.
“While Musk’s political stance could alienate new EV buyers in a tough market, those who are more serious about a Tesla purchase appear less likely to be concerned,” the report said.
The study adds that Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to purchase an EV. But despite the huge discounts on Teslas and insane lease and financing offers on the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla’s favorability reached an all time low of 18% in July among U.S. adults who lean liberal/Democrat.
Even among Republicans, Tesla’s favorability dropped from 36% in January to 18% in May, but rebounded slightly to 22% by July.
Tesla was still the EV market leader in California between January and July 2024, accounting for 56% of the market. But that’s a big drop from its 64% share during the same period last year. In the second quarter of this year, Tesla’s market share in the U.S. slipped to 49.7%, from 59.3% a year earlier, Cox Automotive data suggests.
Now, Tesla is shifting its focus from cars to artificial intelligence and robotics. The company’s robotaxi reveal is set for October 10 and Musk claims that the robotaxi business, along with sales of humanoid robots, could catapult its valuation into the trillions.
Whether that vision becomes reality is anyone’s guess, but one thing is clear: Tesla’s decline is proving more sustained than once anticipated.

'Existential Threat': How China Forced Ford To Get Serious On EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/733777/ford-china-evs-wsj/,Ford's recent decision to push back new EVs is seen as a retreat. But maybe it's a regrouping and reloading instead. Can it work in time?,2024-09-15 10:22:08,"There are two prevailing ways to look at Ford's recent decision to cancel an electric three-row SUV, delay an electric pickup and focus more on hybrids in the immediate term. The more cynical surface read is that Ford is conceding, as many headlines have put it, that ""EVs just aren't working out"" and that hybrids will be a better fit for American buyers anyway.
The other way to read this move is to admit that there are bigger forces at work than just what we see on American roads, and Ford isn't abandoning EVs at all—only giving itself more time and effort to come up with electric options that are truly competitive with the stuff we see coming out of China lately. And that tariffs on Chinese-made EVs will hold them at bay in our market until Ford can deliver more advanced and hopefully profitable EVs in the back half of this decade.
I hope for Ford's sake that it's the second one. But it's still a bold and dangerous bet with no guaranteed chance of success.
I do think Ford understands the stakes, and the statements by CEO Jim Farley and other Ford executives in a recent Wall Street Journal story help drive that home. After all, Farley seems to get how much Ford—as well as General Motors and the remaining Chrysler brands—have lost market share to so-called foreign competitors since their heyday in the 1960s. “I’ve seen this movie before"" is how Farley describes potential competition from China in that story; the whole American auto industry once scoffed at the likes of Toyota and Hyundai. And look where that got them.
The WSJ story is worth a read in full, but it describes the wake-up call Ford got over a series of visits to China in the past 18 months. Here's how Farley broke the news to a board member after one such trip:
In an early-morning call with fellow board member John Thornton, an exasperated Farley unloaded.
The Chinese carmakers are moving at light speed, he told Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who spent years as a senior banker in China. They are using artificial intelligence and other tech in cars that is unlike anything available in the U.S. These Chinese EV makers are using a low-cost supply base to undercut the competition on price, offering slick digital features and aggressively expanding to overseas markets.
“John, this is an existential threat,” Farley said.
Presumably during that same visit, Farley—who's as much a true ""car guy"" as any top executive in the industry and can genuinely handle himself on a race course—got to taste the local flavor for himself. And that was the kind of ""a-ha"" moment that no CEO wants to get about the competition:
In early 2023, Farley made his first trip to China since it reopened after years of pandemic restrictions. He sat in the driver seat of an electric SUV from Ford’s longtime joint-venture partner, Changan Automobile, which for years had been a middling player in China, its market share hovering around 5%.
Farley, who races vintage cars and has an encyclopedic knowledge of car models, thrashed the EV around Changan’s sprawling test track in central China, as Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler rode shotgun. Afterward the executives sat silently, stunned at the progress Changan had made. The ride was smooth and quiet and the cabin upscale, with easy-to-use technology.
“Jim, this is nothing like before,” Lawler told Farley after the drive. “These guys are ahead of us.”
Ford certainly deserves credit for being first to market with the first all-electric pickup truck and bold experiments like the Mustang Mach-E. Those moves have made Ford the top-selling single brand for EVs behind Tesla (although lately, the Hyundai Motor Group has surpassed it in EV sales when all three of its brands are counted together.)
It's also shown a penchant for outside-the-box tactics to entice people into its EVs, like being the first to offer access to Tesla's Supercharger network and kicking off the NACS revolution here in America.
Ford's now-cancelled three-row electric SUV.
But Ford's EVs are getting crushed on costs. They still aren't profitable and the EV division, which Ford breaks out separately from its gas car and commercial units, will probably eat about half of its projected operating profit this year.
That's to be expected as any automaker ramps up its EV and battery supply chain, something that's largely very different from gas cars. But Wall Street isn't necessarily giving Ford the pass it wanted there. And with EVs, the most important component is the most expensive one: the battery. China still owns that supply chain almost completely. While America is making moves to catch up—thanks in large part to incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act—China's head start is massive. Furthermore, the intense ""survival of the fittest"" competition among automakers within China has driven incredible advancements in cost reduction.
In other words, it's clear that as good as the Mach-E and Lightning are, they're first-draft attempts at EVs that just won't cut on the international markets or if Chinese EVs come to America. “Executing to a Chinese standard is going to be the most important priority,” Farley is quoted as saying in the story.
Ford F-150 Lightning at a Tesla Supercharging station
That story also says the CEO sees Chinese EVs as ""an immediate threat in Europe and other overseas markets, and a long-term risk in Ford’s profit engine of North America, regardless of protectionist measures."" I do agree with that; anyone who says ""well, Chinese cars can't come here because of the tariffs"" needs to start thinking more than five minutes into the future.
Or five years, more realistically. As the Chinese automakers scale up in Mexico, it feels like fending them off forever with just tariffs and regulations will be an impossible task.
The story closes with Farley and Doug Field, an Apple and Tesla veteran who leads EV and tech efforts at Ford, scratching their heads on how to cut $800 in cost out of an electric prototype without making the car, in their words, ""really shitty.""
That's what China's automakers have already figured out. Ford hopes to get there eventually too. But it's now a race against time to do it.

GM And Hyundai Join Forces To Boost EV Development,https://insideevs.com/news/733501/gm-hundai-agreement-ev-development/,The two automakers signed a memorandum of understanding today.,2024-09-12 07:39:41,"General Motors and Hyundai Motor Company will explore a slew of collaboration opportunities including co-developing future electric, hydrogen and internal combustion vehicles.
According to the memorandum of understanding that was signed today, the two entities will also look into combining forces to source battery raw materials, steel and others.
It's worth noting that the framework agreement involves GM, which owns several car brands, and Hyundai the individual marque, not Hyundai Motor Group which owns Hyundai, Kia and Genesis. However, the non-binding agreement was signed by GM’s CEO Mary Barra and Hyundai Motor Group’s Executive Chair Euisun Chung.

The two automakers said they will look for ways to leverage their complementary scale and strengths to reduce costs and bring a wider range of vehicles and technologies to customers faster. In other words, they'll work together to share technologies and know-how to potentially bring cheaper cars, including EVs, to the market.
While this agreement is non-binding, meaning they can bail out of the deal, the two companies said work on binding agreements “will begin immediately.”
“GM and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams. Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently,” said Barra.
Top officials from General Motors and Hyundai Motor Company after the two companies signed a memorandum of understanding
It's an interesting and unexpected collaboration between two car manufacturers that are already investing heavily in next-generation electric vehicles that are bound to lower the entry price for potential customers who are not necessarily overly enthusiastic about getting an EV.
The big wave of people who always wanted an EV, even if that meant a higher-than-average price, is reportedly over. Now we need cheaper cars to get the next wave of people interested, and this deal might just help with that.
General Motors’s Ultium woes are behind and the company is chugging along with the launch of several new battery-powered models. At the same time, Hyundai has pledged to continue investing in green vehicles and has seen record sales numbers thanks in no small part to its portfolio of EVs, hybrids and plug-in hybrids. With the two joining forces, the result might be very, very interesting.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tesla Model 3 Prices Dropping Like A ‘Lead Balloon,’ Says Study",https://insideevs.com/news/733279/tesla-model-3-used-ev-prices-dropping/,"Used EV prices dropped six times faster than gas cars. Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt EV top that list.",2024-09-10 17:27:13,"We've been watching this unfold over the past year: electric cars depreciating much faster than their gasoline and hybrid counterparts. This trend came on the heels of Tesla's rapid-fire price cuts last year, and it sparked a price shift that's both exciting and concerning. But let's focus on the upside for now. Lower resale values on EVs mean you can snag a high-tech, modern used electric car for less than the average price of a used hybrid or gas vehicle.
Model Y Price Drop
That’s a win for your bank account and a win for the environment.
Automotive research firm iSeeCars published a study this week explaining the dynamics of the used EV market in the U.S. The study said that prices of cars like the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Niro EV have dropped six times faster than gas cars over the past 12 months.
For starters, used EVs have lost 24.7% of their value since September 2023, compared to 6% for used hybrids and 4.4% for used gas cars. That’s according to a dataset that included 1.6 million one to five-year-old used cars sold between August 2023 and 2024.
“The substantial drop in EV prices over the past year appears to have brought them in line with demand, with used EV days-on-market much lower today, reflecting a faster selling rate compared to a year ago,” Karl Brauer, iSeeCars Executive Analyst said. In short, affordability is driving sales.
Brauer added that the price drops we're seeing now aren't quite as drastic as before. Used EV prices were dropping by 30-40% at the end of 2023 and the start of 2024. The 25% indicates things are leveling off a bit. The average cost of a used EV is now $27,000. It’s expected to stabilize at around $25,000—a price tag many automakers are attempting to hit with their next-generation models.
This has led to used EVs being on the market for an average of 55.3 days in September 2023 to just 38.6 days now. That means used gas cars, hybrids and EVs now take the same amount of time to sell.
The study also added that demand for hybrids remains robust, with fewer fluctuations and price drops like EVs. Used hybrid prices are down just 6% over the past year, whereas used EV prices are down a whopping 24.7% as mentioned.
“People waiting for a good deal on a used electric car have been rewarded for their patience,” Brauer said. “If you bought a used EV a year ago you probably bought too soon, but at today’s prices a used EV is starting to make sense—assuming your lifestyle and vehicle needs line up with the benefits and limitations of an EV.”
So which models are headlining this trend? The average price of a Tesla Model 3 is now about $26,000, over $8,500 less than a year before. The average price of a Kia Niro EV is roughly $22,000, about $6,000 less than last year. The humble Nissan Leaf now costs $16,000, about $4,000 less than 12 months ago. Other notable low-cost used options include the Chevy Bolt EV and the Jaguar I-Pace.
That’s great for the new wave of mass adopters, so long as they’re willing to accept used models.
The Model 3 especially makes sense. Even the versions that arrived before the Highland remain relevant today. It benefits from the vast Supercharger network, has trims that can cover over 300 miles on a single charge and it keeps improving over time with software updates.
If Tesla and CEO Elon Musk don’t rock your boat with their cultural shenanigans and pivot away from cars, the Model 3 remains a great bargain. If they do, you have plenty of other great options to consider. Either way, if you’re in the market for a used EV, there’s never been a better time.

Mercedes Isn't Retreating From China. Its Doubling Down,https://insideevs.com/news/732707/mercedes-benz-china-investment-2025/,The brand is investing $2 Billion into cars that are meant to take on China's homegrown EV startups.,2024-09-07 12:00:00,"Like Volvo, Volkswagen, GM and Ford, Mercedes-Benz has openly walked back its EV future plans. The lozenge-shaped EQ cars are as good as dead, as is the MB.EA EV-specific architecture originally planned to replace the EQE and EQS when they reached the end of their model cycles. Still, despite all that grim news about Mercedes-Benz’s EV future, there are reports coming out of China that Mercedes-Benz is still putting a lot more money into making EVs work, at least in China. Mercedes-Benz is expected to put more than $2 Billion of investment in China to fight against China’s homegrown EV startups like Xpeng, Li Auto and Zeekr, according to local sources like CarNewsChina and CNEVPost.
The $2 billion is cut in two ways: $1.4 billion will reportedly go toward passenger vehicle operations, while the remaining $550 million will be put into Mercedes' commercial vehicle operations. The cars themselves will be produced by Mercedes-Benz’s existing joint venture operations with BAIC (passenger vehicles), and Fujian Benz (commercial vehicles), with the first fruits of the investment coming off production lines next year.
The Mercedes CLA Concept from 2023.
The first full EV will be the localized version of the electric CLA class. We already know that the new CLA will be based on the new MMA platform, but China’s version will be a localized long-wheelbase version explicitly for that market.
Most of Mercedes-Benz’s push and hope for its future is based on its ability to craft localized products that are compelling to Chinese buyers. It plans on introducing a specially crafted (ICE-powered) long-wheelbase GLE SUV just for China, as well as a luxury EV MPV meant to do battle with options from Zeekr, Voyah and Buick. This VAN.EA platform is expected to underpin all of Mercedes-Benz’s future EV van commercial vehicles and be made by its Chinese JV partner, Fujian Benz.
This is uncharted waters for most brands, especially luxury ones like Mercedes-Benz. For a long time, “BBA”, also known as Benz-BMW-Audi, had been somewhat insulated from China’s market changes, still turning consistent sales and strong profits. Now, that’s not the case. As China’s market continues to shift to full electrification, Mercedes-Benz’s EV efforts have not resonated with Chinese buyers while its ICE offerings continue to lose relevance. Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said it best; “There are no more cheques coming from China,” alluding to Western automakers' falling profits in China.
It seems like so many Western brands are at a crossroads in China. Are they to continue to invest and hope it pays off? Or do they cut and run? Mercedes-Benz isn’t the only German brand to invest even deeper in China. Volkswagen’s partnership with Xpeng is designed to right the ship and get the brand back on course in the country.
But these deeper partnerships don’t always work. Mitsubishi once was a prominent supplier of engines in many Chinese ICE cars during the 1990s and 2000s, but its lackluster ICE products never resonated all that deeply with Chinese consumers. When the market shifted to EVs and PHEVs, it tried its hand at selling reworked GAC motor products (the Eupheme EV/PHEV and Airtrek), but it wasn’t enough to boost the brand’s lagging sales. Mitsubishi stopped producing cars in China in late 2023, effectively ending its nearly 30-year run in the country.
Will Mercedes-Benz’s investment pay off? We’ll just have to wait and see.

Zeekr Increasingly Feels Like A Polestar Do-Over,https://insideevs.com/news/731929/zeekr-polestar-geely-cm/,"As Polestar falters, this Geely-backed EV company is one to watch. Plus: Hyundai's Genesis needs hybrids to grow.",2024-08-30 09:49:19,"It's got a sport sedan. It's got a crossover. It's even got a robotaxi you'll soon see on U.S. roads. So not only does China's Zeekr brand—part of the Geely Group conglomerate that also owns Volvo, Lotus and more—feel like one of the most direct shots at Tesla yet, but more and more, it feels like what Geely actually wanted to do with Polestar.
It's a slow news day on the mobility and tech front ahead of Labor Day in the U.S., but Critical Materials still has you covered. Also on tap this Friday: why Genesis needs hybrids more than other brands do right now, and why it's due to premier the newest and best of what the Hyundai Motor Group is cooking up.
Zeekr 7X
We like to try to be ahead of the curve here at InsideEVs. And all year, our man Kevin Williams has been telling you that Geely's Zeekr brand is one to watch. Not long after he was pretty impressed by its offerings in China, Zeekr even got listed on the New York Stock Exchange and inked a deal with Google's Waymo to supply its next-generation robotaxis even on American roads.
Clearly, Geely has big plans for Zeekr. And I'd argue that its latest debut, the Zeekr 7X crossover, is the biggest deal yet. Here's CNBC on what to expect:
Electric vehicle company Zeekr announced Friday that it would launch its first SUV in China next month, undercutting Tesla’s Model Y pricing in the country by over $1,400.
The Zeekr 7X, priced at 239,900 yuan ($33, 829), is the Chinese EV maker’s first midsize electric SUV and will be launched on Sept. 20.
It’s the latest Chinese EV to take on Tesla’s Model Y, which has also been challenged by Xpeng and Nio. Zeekr plans to deliver the 7X globally by the end of this year. It said the launch was targeted at global markets but did not specify the regions.
The five-seater Zeekr 7X SUV comes with two battery options that allow users to drive between 605 kilometers and 780 kilometers (about 376 to 485 miles) on a single charge. Developed by Zeekr’s engineers, the lithium-ion phosphate batteries take 10.5 minutes to charge by 75%, the company said.
Zeekr has said in the past that its latest batteries offer the fastest charge in the world, beating that of Tesla’s.
That story says global markets haven't been announced, but it's basically a lock to enter Europe in 2025—where it's also considering local production to duck tariffs.
So between the huge lineup, the advanced tech, the robotaxi, the clear aim at Western buyers and Tesla's dominance, this whole playbook feels like what Geely aimed to do a decade ago with Polestar—but ultimately faltered.
As our Rob Stumpf wrote yesterday, much of Polestar merely cannibalized designs from Volvo, leaving the latter brand pretty devoid of EVs. And Polestar's strategy got hammered by the increase in protective anti-China tariffs all over the world.
So Zeekr could be Polestar 2.0, with the fresh, new product that brand never had, and a better understanding of the modern rules of engagement around EVs from China. Tariffs are what they are, but if I had to put money on it, I'd say we'll see them for sale in America someday.
Polestar 4 premiere in Spain
I don't mean all of this to dog on Polestar. I actually like Polestar. When shopping for an EV earlier this summer, a Polestar 2 was our runner-up choice; the Polestar 3 crossover looks extremely promising; and I have this weird affinity for the Polestar 4 after sitting in one in New York. I kind of want one someday.
But that can only happen if the brand survives long enough. Right now, things look dark. It replaced its founding CEO with an industry veteran this week, albeit one with more experience running brands on the decline than on the rise. And though sales were up more than 80% this past quarter, the company's results continue to be not great. From Bloomberg:
The Swedish manufacturer reported a $242.3 million operating loss for the second quarter, although this was slightly narrower than the corresponding three-month period last year. Revenue dropped 17% to $574.9 million due to “lower global volumes and higher discounts,” Polestar said Thursday.
Once a vanguard of the electric-car movement, Polestar is grappling with high costs and increasing competition from new players, including from China. At the same time, consumer demand for EVs is waning amid high inflation and the end of subsidies in key markets, forcing some carmakers to offer discounts. Polestar’s share price has plunged by more than 90% since spinning out of Volvo Car AB two years ago.
Polestar expects more growth soon from the 3 and 4 going on sale. Can those two models reverse its fortunes?
Genesis Neolun Concept
Hyundai gave us a lot of future-facing news this week, including plans for more hybrids and an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) platform. But I was surprised at the lack of Genesis-specific announcements during that event in Seoul; often, automakers use investor-facing presentations to really hype up their luxury brands.
And the Korean giant clearly has big plans for Genesis beyond ""fancy Hyundais."" That includes the Genesis GV90, previewed by the Neolun concept seen above, and now more hybrid models too as it aims to accelerate its growth and compete more evenly with big names like Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.
Here's Automotive News:
Consumer demand for conventional gasoline-electric hybrids has increased this year as EVs remain unaffordable to most mainstream consumers, and the build-out of the EV charging infrastructure has been slow going.
""Customers who live in Los Angeles or the smile states, where there's more charging infrastructure, are embracing electric vehicles. But if they're in the middle of the country, for example, a hybrid is more their speed,"" Ash Corson, director of product planning for Genesis, told Automotive News.
Corson's group has been working closely with dealers so the brand can bring the ""the right product at the right time in the right place.""
Adding hybrids is part of that plan, he said.
[...] Genesis' current global goal is to eliminate sales of new gasoline-powered models by 2025 on the path to becoming all electric by 2030.
A Genesis spokesperson said they are not making changes to its commitments ""for the time being.""
One analyst quoted in that story speculates that perhaps the next evolution of Hyundai's E-GMP platform could accommodate hybrid power as well. Maybe adding a gas engine to that could be the EREV that Hyundai is planning? I expect we'll learn more next year.
Zeekr 7X
That Zeekr 7X looks like a real contender. So does this brand have the juice, and would you consider one if it was available in your market?

Polestar Gets A New CEO. Can He Turn Things Around?,https://insideevs.com/news/731640/polestar-ceo-xpeng-vw-cm/,"Volvo's troubled electric ""spinoff"" gets a new boss. Plus: Volkswagen gets tighter with China's Xpeng and BYD keeps the profits coming.",2024-08-28 10:21:50,"Let's hop in the DeLorean (an electric-converted one, naturally) and head way back in time to the distant past—the year 2021. Back then, interest rates were low, free money was cheap and every automaker looked at Tesla's sky-high valuations and said ""How hard can it be?"" That's the year Volvo parent company Geely Group began to go public with Polestar, which had turned from a performance label within Volvo to a standalone car brand four years prior. For a time, the future for Polestar seemed bright.
Except that it kind of hasn't been. Dogged for a long time by having just one EV in its lineup—a sedan in an SUV world—as well as slowing sales, production delays, trouble with tariffs, an unclear differentiation from Volvo and other problems, Polestar is replacing its founding CEO. Can the new guy, an industry veteran, turn things around for this troubled brand?
That kicks off today's Critical Materials, our morning roundup of must-read news about tech and mobility. Also on deck: Volkswagen gets even closer with Chinese partner Xpeng, and BYD brings the profits.
First customer deliveries of Polestar 3: Polestar’s headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden—June 27, 2024
My colleague Iulian Dnistran broke down the surprise resignation of Polestar's founding CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, and in that story he also outlined some of the many problems facing that brand. Ingenlath was a designer by trade and brought us, among other things, the Polestar 1 and Polestar 2.
The new boss is Michael Lohscheller, a business guy through and through. He started his automotive career at what was then called DaimlerChrysler and had stints at Mitsubishi and Volkswagen before taking the top job at then-European General Motors subsidiary Opel. When Opel became part of Stellantis in 2021, he did what everybody at Stellantis seems to do and got the hell out.
Given his extensive background, I think he deserves a bit more credit than the CEO roles at his last two gigs: Vietnam's VinFast, where he lasted about six months, and then leading troubled hydrogen truck startup Nikola.
I think Polestar is a vastly more legitimate enterprise than either of those companies, especially with the backing of Geely, which seems very serious about global expansion. But Lohscheller has a lot to figure out. Bloomberg explains:
Backed by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu, Polestar has struggled with delays in rolling out new models, while competition has been especially intense in China, a market it targeted for growth. The EV manufacturer has lost about 90% of its value since spinning out of Volvo Car AB two years ago.
Ingenlath’s tenure has been marked by management upheaval, disappointing sales, and the threat of losing the company’s US stock-market listing after failing to produce financial reports on time. His departure follows a broader reshuffle in June, as former Volkswagen executive Winfried Vahland was tapped to replace chairman Hakan Samuelsson.
There are some bright spots for Polestar, of course. The Polestar 2 may be getting a bit long in the tooth but it remains one of our favorite EVs on sale. The U.S.-built Polestar 3 SUV should help the brand get mainstream success the 2 sedans could not deliver, and the Polestar 4 seems like a unique and compelling option in a field where EVs don't always stand out.
But it's still got costs to get under control, a long-term strategy to launch, a ""we're not Volvo"" brand problem to sort out and car production that's both scattered across the globe and still largely dependent on Volvo in many places. Lohscheller had better be up for the task.
VW Xpeng Architecture
You'll hear more news from us today about China's Xpeng. But among other things, the rapidly rising automaker has a lot to teach new partner Volkswagen, which has also struggled with the software and tech side of the EV transition.
More than that, VW didn't count on getting hammered as badly as it has been in China. Sales of all its brands in that all-important market are falling fast. So just as VW is turning to Rivian for electrical architecture help here, it's partnering with Xpeng for China's next-gen EVs.
And CNBC reports that this is not exactly a partnership of equals in terms of know-how:
Hundreds of Volkswagen staff are spending time at Xpeng as the German auto giant and Chinese startup work to create electric cars for China, Xpeng co-president Brian Gu told CNBC on Monday.
He also said the partnership will help Xpeng’s global ambitions.
Volkswagen in July 2023 announced a $700 million investment into Xpeng to jointly develop two electric cars for delivery in China in 2026. The vehicles will be based on the platform for Xpeng’s G9, a midsize electric crossover SUV.
The German company’s workers are spending more time at Xpeng’s offices than the startup’s are at Volkswagen’s, Gu said. They are learning about the startup’s technology.
[...] Gu emphasized the forthcoming vehicles will be “very different” from those that currently sold by Xpeng or Volkswagen. He said the cars would likely have “better range, charging, much smarter driving, more feature luxury technology, for the same price, potentially.”
China learned to make cars through joint ventures with Western and other Asian automakers. Clearly, the roles have reversed now that the EV revolution is underway.
BYD Lineup 2024
Meanwhile, as countless other automakers slow their EV plans, BYD is still crushing it—even amid an economic downturn in its native China. And it's only just now starting its big expansions into Europe and Mexico; we've only seen the tip of that iceberg.
Here's another from Reuters on BYD's strong returns in Q2:
BYD's net profit hit 9.1 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in the April-June quarter, up 32.8% from a year earlier and its fastest growth since end-2023, while revenue grew 25.9% to 176.2 billion yuan, it said in a stock exchange filing.
Sales of autos and related products accounted for 75.8% of BYD's overall revenue and their gross margin rose to 23.9% in the first half of 2024, up 3.3 percentage points from the same period last year.
Gross margin fell to 18.69% in the second quarter from 21.88% the first quarter, per Reuters' calculations based on its fiscal disclosure.
BYD has taken a significant lead in the Chinese electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sector, leveraging its vertical integration strategy by using key components such as batteries made by the company.
And as the rest figure out how to make EVs more affordable, I will just add this:
""For vehicles priced (in China) under 150,000 yuan ($21,046), BYD holds absolute pricing power because, aside from glass and tires, it manufactures almost everything in-house,"" said Rosalie Chen, analyst at Third Bridge.
Over half of the cars sold in China are priced under $21,000.
That's why all the others had better get serious about this stuff soon.
Polestar 4 In New York
If you were in Lohscheller's shoes today, how would you approach these challenges? What would you do to make Polestar a ""leader in the premium electric vehicle market,"" as the company puts it?
And does Polestar have what it takes to go the distance as a standalone brand, or could we see it fold back into Volvo—or Zeekr?

Hyundai Ioniq 9 Three-Row SUV To Be Built In America; 560-Mile 'EREV' In 2026,https://insideevs.com/news/731616/hyundai-investor-day-ioniq-9/,"At Hyundai's CEO Investor Day event, big plans to speed up on EVs—and a ""bridge"" vehicle that drives like an EV but packs a gas engine too.",2024-08-28 08:22:13,"Yet again, as other automakers begin to slow down on electric vehicles, Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is stepping on the accelerator. At the automaker's annual CEO Investor Day event in Seoul, senior leaders announced their strategy over the next few years, keeping a goal to sell 2 million EVs per year globally by 2030 but adding more hybrids into the mix—including a long-rumored new type of vehicle that may serve as the ultimate ""bridge"" between internal combustion and electric power.
Hyundai Motor President and CEO Jae Hoon Chang also announced big plans for the U.S. market, and for U.S. jobs: the upcoming new Hyundai Ioniq 9 electric three-row SUV will be built at the new Metaplant in Georgia, joining the familiar Ioniq 5 expected to start production there later this year.
In doing so, Chang also reaffirmed the name of the new SUV, which was previously called the Hyundai Ioniq 7. Unveiled as the Hyundai Seven Concept in 2021, the production version is expected to be seen at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this year.
""Hyundai Motor is making significant strides in its quest to become a global top-tier player in the EV market,"" Chang said in prepared remarks. ""As the only global automaker with a full battery system lineup, Hyundai Motor is dedicated not only to improving battery performance but also to ensuring that EVs are affordable, safe and easy to maintain.""
Georgia production of the Ioniq 9 had been expected, especially given the success of the similar Kia EV9 three-row crossover in America—which is also now built in the U.S. The Metaplant factory in Bryan County near Savannah is due to produce up to 300,000 vehicles per year while bringing thousands of jobs to the area, company officials have said. Building the Ioniq 9 here should qualify the car for U.S. EV tax credits of some sort.
In addition, with Ford now pivoting to a hybrid setup for its previously all-electric three-row SUV, Hyundai and Kia may get an even bigger lock on the mainstream three-row EV segment—for now, at least.
But even as it kept in place that aggressive global EV sales target, Hyundai officials admitted that the path to an electric future has been slower and less even than expected. As such, Chang confirmed that the automaker will step into EREVs—short for ""Extended Range Electric Vehicle.""
A modern take on the concept pioneered by the BMW i3 and Chevrolet Volt, an EREV is essentially a battery-powered EV that also packs a gas engine, but only as a generator to recharge that battery pack. The gas engine does not drive the wheels.
""The new EREV will combine the advantages of internal combustion engines and EVs,"" Chang said. ""Hyundai Motor has developed a unique new powertrain and power electronics system to enable four-wheel drive with the application of two motors. The operation is powered solely by electricity, similar to EVs, with the engine being used only for battery charging.""
In addition, that EREV model will be built in North America (the automaker did not disclose exactly where) and China in 2026, Chang said. They will debut as SUVs from Hyundai and the Genesis luxury brand with a target of 80,000 units per year on this continent. At least some models will offer ""refueling and stress-free charging"" with a range of over 900 km, or 560 miles, when fully charged.
""It provides EREV customers with a responsive EV-like driving experience, allowing consumers to naturally transition to EVs during future demand recovery periods,"" Chang said. From 2030 onward, ""Hyundai Motor aims to build a full lineup of EVs, from affordable EVs to luxury and high-performance models, and launch 21 models by 2030 to provide consumers with various options."" China will get more subcompact EREV models too, he added.
Earlier reports indicated that the next Hyundai Santa Fe and future trucks could get an EREV setup, but that was not confirmed on today's call.
Hyundai isn't the only automaker getting into the EREV game. Stellantis is as well, with the highly anticipated Ram Ramcharger truck that rides on a battery EV platform but also uses a V6 engine only for recharging. Mercedes-Benz is rumored to offer the same setup as an option on the upcoming CLA-Class too. By building cars on an EV platform but adding a gas engine only for charging, automakers can prepare their R&D and manufacturing for the future while the EV charging networks get built out—all with the ostensible goal of going all-electric someday. At least, that's the idea, anyway.
In the meantime, Hyundai also announced a major expansion of its hybrid offerings. The automaker has seen considerable success in the U.S. with cars like the Santa Fe Hybrid and Sonata Hybrid, so more models are coming, including to Genesis. Those cars will also be built in Georgia. ""This strategy will allow the company to respond swiftly to the North American market, which currently faces a shortage of hybrid supply, and to enhance the operational efficiency of the factory,"" Chang said.
Perhaps most importantly, Hyundai is targeting one thing for all of these electrified cars that has often eluded other automakers: actual profits across the board. ""The company expects to achieve equal profitability on its entire powertrain lineup, including ICE, hybrids, EREVs and EVs by 2030,"" Chang said.

Polestar’s CEO Is Out,https://insideevs.com/news/731572/polestar-new-ceo/,"Thomas Ingenlath, the automaker’s head honcho from its inception, has resigned.",2024-08-28 03:46:40,"Polestar, the electric car manufacturer owned by Chinese-based giant Geely, will have a new chief executive officer starting in October. On October 1, Thomas Ingenlath, who served as CEO since the company’s inception as a standalone automaker in 2017, will step down.
Michael Lohscheller will take his place and try to transform Polestar from an EV startup into a bigger player in the automotive industry. Lohscheller was CEO at several other automotive companies in the last decade. Between 2017 and 2021 he spearheaded Opel, then moved to the position of Global CEO at VinFast. After just seven months, he jumped ship to Nikola, the maker of battery- and hydrogen-powered big rigs, where he acted as both president and CEO until September 2023, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Michael Lohscheller, the new CEO of Polestar
“Polestar has experienced an exceptional start-up phase and with a broader model line-up, Michael Lohscheller is the ideal leader to guide Polestar into its next chapter,” said Winfried Vahland, Polestar’s incoming Chairman. “His deep industry knowledge, especially in driving operational excellence, developing a coherent product strategy and strengthening the global market presence will be instrumental in the next chapter of Polestar’s growth.”
Polestar, which currently sells three models–the Polestar 2, Polestar 3 and Polestar 4–had a rough first half of the year in terms of sales. Globally, the Geely subsidiary sold roughly 20,200 cars, down 27% year-over-year.
More Polestar Stories
All three models are currently being assembled in China, which isn’t ideal for the aspiring automaker’s U.S. ambitions, considering the hiked import tariffs. Its fortunes, stateside at least, lie on the Polestar 3 which recently entered local production in South Carolina, thus avoiding costly import duties and keeping losses to a minimum.
As a reminder, Polestar wants to fight with names like BMW, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. In other words, it’s betting on high-priced models in a market that seemingly wants more affordable cars, so it will be interesting to see what its new CEO will bring to the table.
“Polestar has already established itself as one of the most desirable and innovative brands in the electric vehicle space, and I look forward to working with the talented team to build on this strong foundation and accelerate our development,” said Michael Lohscheller.",Iulian Dnistran
This Was Not A Great Week For 'Legacy' Auto—With Two Exceptions,https://insideevs.com/news/731161/cm-ford-gm-vw-hyundai/,"Let's game out what this week's news meant for the EV transition at Ford, GM, Volkswagen and Hyundai. Plus, Volvo has big plans for EX90.",2024-08-23 09:15:49,"Sometimes, when I look back at the commitments many so-called ""legacy"" automakers made to go fully electric and software-powered one day, it feels like all of them thought: ""How hard can it be, right?"" As we saw this week, the answer is ""very hard.""
And one day, we may all look back on 2024 as the most chaotic year of the transition to a cleaner and hopefully better future for the car industry.
For this Friday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of news about the EV transition and technology, I want to look back at some wins and losses from several of the big players and parse out what it means for what's next.
Plus: Volvo makes a big bet on the EX90, and BYD solidifies its plans for Mexico. Let's go.
Ford EV Battery
Let's face it: this was not a great week for several big, legacy automakers trying to figure out what's next. We'll start with Ford, since that was the big one.
A few years ago, Ford decided to separate out its sales and financial results into three divisions: EVs, traditional gas vehicles and its commercial operation. At least one goal was to ""unlock Tesla-like value,"" to drive up the stock price by showing investors—who care about the future—that it was progressing like a big tech company.
It hasn't worked. Instead, the continual losses of the electric Model e division kind of made Ford a punching bag. Every quarter and at least once a year, the headlines and investors gripe about the billions in losses and mounting costs around going electric, even if that is to be expected for ramping up an entirely new supply chain and manufacturing ecosystem.
It turns out the investors care about their future, but also want their money right now.
Those losses, and the newfound belief that battery costs won't ever make big electric SUVs and trucks truly viable, meant a strategy shift this week: Ford is canceling a three-row electric SUV, pushing back a new electric truck and focusing on hybrids instead.
As my colleague Kevin Williams pointed out, this means that besides a new electric commercial van, Ford won't have any new EV models until 2027.
That's three years away; three years ago, I'd wager most of the vehicles we write about on InsideEVs didn't exist yet.
There are two ways to read Ford's news this week. The generous read is that Ford is doing what it can to keep investors happy, as any publicly traded company must; that the truly telling move is that Ford isn't slowing down on battery plant investments; and that it may well be right about hybrids being a better solution for bigger vehicles.
But if you want to go glass-half-empty, then we could look at this week as the one where Ford began its transition to just being a gas-powered truck company someday—one that could never make EVs work in volume and will be a kind of John Deere-type company in the subsequent decades. Give Ford an excuse, in other words, and it will take the easy way out.
Market realities are one thing, sure. But so far, Ford's path to EV profits seems dismal. It needs a reset, and pushing those products back to the latter half of this decade—where it may even have to compete with China's automakers in America—is a huge gamble.
US-spec 2024 Volkswagen ID. Buzz LWB exterior driving shots
Then we have Volkswagen, the original ""pivot to EVs"" automaker. The long-awaited ID. Buzz is finally coming to America after a development cycle that makes a new Tesla look punctual, and the price and specs just do not feel competitive. And after ""indefinitely postponing"" the ID.7 sedan for America, Volkswagen has in the pipeline... what, exactly? More mainstream-looking EV models coming, we think, but again, not until the latter part of this decade. And then it may have tougher competition than ever.
Ford, thankfully, is not VW, which only has around 4% market share in the U.S., still lacks a strong brand identity here and just doesn't have that compelling of a lineup beyond the ID.4 (which, admittedly, is better than ever) and the GTI and Golf R. We are getting to a point where it's worth asking if the U.S. market needs the VW brand at all; it had better have an answer to that before the day comes when it has to go up against BYD and the like on our shores.
Next up is General Motors, which is actually in the midst of a pretty good year for EV releases and sales. But it still laid off 1,000 software and services employees this week in an effort to ""streamline"" operations and, based on all we've heard, reduce bloat and bureaucracy. Again, the generous read is that under its new software leadership, GM is taking steps to focus on power-hitter hires and be the best in the game; the less generous read is that it still hasn't figured out its software game. And 1,000 software engineers say they were ""thrown onto the curb like useless trash."" It's just very unfortunate.
You can't expect car companies to make unprofitable products forever, and sure, they're all reckoning with rapidly changing buyer tastes—people want plug-in hybrids now, actually!—in a capital-investive environment that takes years of planning and development.
Yet it does feel like many of them should've figured this out by now. And it's only fair to begin wondering if they ever can, or if the plan is to just pivot back to gas cars like they've always done.
So what are the two exceptions I put in that headline? Well, Hyundai Motor Group (whose executives have claimed to us that their EVs are profitable) is now the no. 2 EV seller behind Tesla in the U.S. And BMW just outpaced Tesla's EV sales in Europe. True, both situations were ""helped"" by Tesla's lost sales momentum. Still, both are remarkable achievements.
One Honda executive is probably right: you can't force people into EVs. But in the next few years, we'll find out who's actually serious about making the technology of the future work, and who just expected customers to show up like they always have.
Volvo EX90 Rear view
That was a long time to charge up to 30% (Critical Materials is an old Nissan Leaf today) so I'll be quicker on these next two items. You'll read a full review of the new, electric Volvo EX90 from Deputy Editor Mack Hogan next week, but make no mistake: this is a big deal for the Geely-owned Swedish brand. From Automotive News, which begins with Volvo's sliding electric sales:
But Michael Cottone, Volvo Cars' U.S. boss, hopes to change that trajectory with a pair of next-generation crossovers that will bookend the brand's EV lineup and reach crucial new audiences.
At the top end is the new three-row EX90 flagship expected to glide into stores in late 2024. It will be followed by Volvo's most compact and least expensive model — the EX30 crossover — in the second half of next year.
""[The EX90] is the first car that we will have launched and developed outside of Europe in our company's almost 100-year history,"" Cottone said at an Aug. 21 media event in Southern California. ""This car was designed for the U.S. market and then built in the U.S. market.""
[...]  Volvo dealer Matthew Haiken said the EX90 will resonate because it is an evolution of a familiar design. The new model has the DNA of the XC90, which Haiken said has become a classic like the Range Rover or Porsche 911.
""Most EVs look like computers on wheels,"" said Haiken, owner of Prestige Collection, which operates Volvo stores in East Hanover and Englewood, N.J. ""The EX90 is the antithesis of the Tesla Model X.""
After months of delays due to software issues (here we go again) Volvo officials say they will be careful here to allocate EX90 volume to the right places that can meet demand: ""California, the Northwest and the Mid-Atlantic region.""
Also, did you know the XC90 is still Volvo's bestselling model and accounts for almost one-third of its volume? I did not. That's also why Volvo is bringing back the XC90 as a heavily refreshed plug-in hybrid; I'm wondering if that was always in the cards, or if it's hedging its bets in case the EX90 doesn't take off.
BYD Shark
And here, finally, is why complacency is not an option.
Mexico's federal government is under pressure from the U.S., its biggest trading partner and ours, not to give incentives to the Chinese automakers to set up factories there.
But nothing is stopping the local governments in Mexico from doing that, and Reuters reports that's coming right along:
Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has narrowed its list of finalists for the location of a manufacturing plant in Mexico down to three states and is reviewing a range of proposed incentives from them, the firm's country head said on Wednesday.
Jorge Vallejo, BYD's Mexico director general, told Reuters the company was reviewing the latest proposals by the candidate states, which have offered ""many benefits"" including fiscal, land, management and preferential pricing incentives.
Mexico's northern Nuevo Leon state is an automotive hub, and the location of a proposed Tesla mega-factory. It will also be home to a new Volvo plant, the state's governor said this week.
BYD executives swear that they aren't eyeing the U.S. market and a Mexican factory would be focused on that country's market and the rest of Latin America. If you truly believe that, email me, because I have a bridge to sell you. Tariffs will only keep these automakers out of the U.S. for so long; they had better come up with a way to compete, and 2027 may be too late.
Hyundai Ioniq 5 Microfactory Singapore
To his credit, I do think Ford CEO Jim Farley gets the threat to his company posed by China. ""As CEO of a company that has had trouble competing with the Japanese and South Koreans,"" Farley said this earlier year, ""we have to fix this problem. We have to address this."" He's right, too—and I think he's probably right about huge expensive batteries not being the answer.
So how does Ford, or any of these companies here, fix that problem? What aren't they doing now that they should be?

Zeekr Plans To Add 'Innovative Super Hybrid' Flagship In 2025,https://insideevs.com/news/730921/zeekr-super-hybrid-geely-2025/,Zeekr CEO Andy An announced during the brand's Q2 earnings call that the all-electric brand is adding plug-in hybrid power for its flagship SUV.,2024-08-21 13:30:30,"Electric Vehicle startup and spinoff from Geely, Zeekr, had its second-quarter earnings call this morning. Things seem to be going well, but Zeekr CEO Andy An dropped a bombshell at the end of the call, confirming a rumor on social media. Zeekr will add a hybrid model to its lineup.
Now, this is definitely confusing for everyone involved. Currently, Zeekr advertises itself as a fully electric brand, and this new hybrid model throws a wrench into that. Even more interesting is that An says it will use an entirely new hybrid technology system. This will be different from the NordThor system currently in service in other Geely and Lynk & Co products. This model will be a flagship, sitting at the top of the Zeekr range.
I reached out to Zeekr for more clarity on the decision. Zeekr’s flagship, a large SUV, will be available in two forms. One will be pure electric, but the other will be what the representative called an “innovative super hybrid powertrain…designed to merge the benefits of a battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and extended-range electric vehicle,” the representative said via WeChat. “This innovative powertrain aims to provide an ultimate driving experience akin to that of BEVs, while delivering exceptional fuel efficiency at high speeds and an enhanced range,” Zeekr says this model will launch in the second half of 2025.
Considering Zeekr’s status as a premium brand inside and outside of China, it’s clear that Zeekr’s product lineup is aiming straight at brands like BYD. On paper, Zeekr’s basic idea for a luxury flagship PHEV crossover feels like it’s aimed straight at the (BYD) Yangwang U8, the Land Rover Defender-esque SUV that can float down rivers and moonwalk across the road. It could also compete with Western luxury flagship models like the Mercedes-Benz G580 EV, or BMW XM.
On some level, this feels like a step backward, as if Zeekr and Geely are admitting that perhaps EVs aren’t always the solution, even in the world’s biggest EV market. Zeekr says that it made the decision to “meet the needs of our customers, especially regarding the powertrain of a large SUV.” Perhaps this is prescient, and Zeekr (and Geely) are just reading the room and responding to the strong demand for hybrid amongst consumers. Ford killed its large EV crossover to focus on hybrids, to the chagrin and ire of EV enthusiasts and analysts alike. Maybe Ford and Zeekr are ahead of the game here.
On the other hand, Zeekr’s earnings call revealed that its EV-only lineup is doing well. Sales are up nearly 100% compared to last year during the same quarter. Losses are up 28.7% compared to last year but down 10.7% compared to last quarter. Gross revenue is up and Zeekr’s vehicle margin has improved as well. Zeekr says it is still on track to reach profitability, but it didn’t say if it will change its original goal by the end of this year. It plans to launch two new full EV models by the end of the year, the 7X crossover and the MIX mini MPV.
Given Zeekr’s focus on growth and profit, it wouldn’t be surprising if Zeekr’s other EVs and now hybrid vehicles make it out of China. Will the U.S. be next? We’ll just have to wait and see how things play out after this year’s election.

"Ford's 'Skunkworks' EV Truck Will Be Midsize, Not Compact",https://insideevs.com/news/730922/ford-skunkworks-ev-midsize-compact/,Ford announced lots of EV and hybrid news today. Among them: its secretive California-based truck project may be bigger than expected.,2024-08-21 12:30:00,"Things are changing at Ford. Again. Apparently, and perhaps understandably, fed up with the lack of profits from electric vehicles despite becoming America's second-best-selling EV brand behind Tesla, the Dearborn automaker is retooling its electrified roadmap.
A three-row electric SUV is out, a hybrid three-row SUV is in, and a truck that seems like an F-150 Lightning replacement has been pushed back to 2027.
But one of the most interesting details in Ford's strategy announcement today deals with the secretive ""skunkworks"" project based in California: the first vehicle on a new, lower-cost EV platform will be a midsize pickup truck, not a compact one as many—including us—had assumed.
On a media briefing InsideEVs attended this morning, Ford officials declined to provide many more details about the truck, including what its exact size could be—or if it will have any direct analogs in the current Ford lineup. That included a question on whether the truck will be more like the Ranger, or the smaller Maverick. ""We're not going to talk about that,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on the call. ""We'd love to put it all out there right now, but it's too early to do that, given the competitive nature of the segment.""
However, in Ford's own parlance, ""compact"" pretty clearly refers to the Maverick, while ""midsize"" refers to the Ranger. In other words, it feels like a safe bet that this truck should be larger than expected.
Lawler and other officials declined to offer any other new details about the truck, including its battery, range, performance or other specs. Previously, CEO Jim Farley confirmed the skunkworks team was working on a low-cost EV platform that would yield electric models that are profitable from $25,000 to $30,000; it's unclear if that remains the truck's price target or not. The vehicle was presumed to be a competitor to a raft of newer, more affordable EV options coming to market in 2025, 2026 and beyond, including the reborn Chevrolet Bolt EUV, the Jeep Renegade, the Kia EV3 and possibly a new entrant from Tesla.
But if the ""skunkworks"" truck ends up being more Ranger-sized—while the T3 seems to analogous to the F-150—that would be an interesting decision on Ford's part, and one that could potentially drive up its price tag.
Asked whether this new midsize truck could still be in Farley's $30,000 and under comments, ""I wouldn't associate the comment with specifics of our announcement today,"" a Ford spokesperson told InsideEVs. This person added that Farley's comments are indeed ""a target, not an announcement of actual pricing of the product itself."" The gas-powered Ranger starts at $32,720, before destination fees. It is also sold as a plug-in hybrid, but not in the U.S. market.
It's also an interesting sizing choice for Ford that may be tied to things like battery costs, range and capability, as well as sale price.
Ford Ranger Plug-in Hybrid 2025
The Ranger consistently trails other midsize truck options in the field in sales, including the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon and Toyota Tacoma—the latter of which remains the undisputed champion of the field. Last year, the smaller Maverick outsold the Ranger nearly three-to-one. And many prospective EV buyers had been looking forward to the possibility of a compact urban truck that runs on batteries but can still do some light towing and hauling in a pinch.
But much of this is speculation until we know more about the truck. Ford today said it's due to launch in 2027 and will ""cater to customers who want more for their money—more range, more utility, more useability."" Ford has not announced a manufacturing site for the midsize truck yet.
Ford's ""skunkworks"" EV project—so named due to its secretive nature—was established almost three years ago as a kind of internal startup. It has since poached top talent from Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Apple and more, and has sought to make a clean-sheet EV platform that can produce many lower-cost vehicles and compete with newcomers from China.
Could this be the electric Ford truck you wanted? Let us know in the comments.

"Ford Revises Its EV Plan: SUV Canceled, More Hybrids Coming",https://insideevs.com/news/730889/ford-ev-strategy-august-2024/,"Ford is America's no. 2 electric brand. But profits have been elusive, so it's adjusting the entire plan.",2024-08-21 08:00:10,"Ford is America's number two electric vehicle brand behind Tesla. But getting there hasn't been easy.
Over the past few years of F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E sales, Ford has sunk billions into models that aren't proving to be profitable, all while it deals with an uneven electric market, a boosted in interest in hybrids, intensifying competition and a rising China.
As a result, the Dearborn automaker today announced some major changes to its EV and hybrid plan, and that includes 10% less capital spending on purely electric models overall.
Ford announced that it will no longer make a three-row electric SUV as planned, but will go hybrid with those models instead; the so-called ""skunkworks"" electric truck is confirmed to be a midsize truck, not a compact one as many assumed; will not launch any EVs unless they can be profitable in the first 12 months; and continue to provide gas and diesel vehicles, among other things.
The changes in plans could equate to an anticipated $1.9 billion in additional costs, Ford officials said.
""It's coming back to understanding the customer, understanding how this is going to transition over time,"" Ford CFO John Lawler said on a media briefing this morning. ""It's about providing them those choices that meet their duty cycles and their needs, and that is giving them the options between full battery electric vehicles, hybrid technologies.""
Ford F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E
Ford officials didn't elaborate when asked by InsideEVs where their EV sales or profits were projected to be versus where they are now, but said its overall strategy to use electrification to reduce CO2 emissions has not changed.
""We are launching multiple electric vehicles in Europe this year,"" Ford said in a statement. ""We are adjusting the company’s North America vehicle roadmap to offer a range of electrification options designed to speed customer adoption, including lower prices and longer ranges.""
Among the major changes in strategy: Ford is pushing back its midsize T3 electric truck, considered a more cutting-edge successor to the F-150 Lightning, to the second half of 2027. The truck will be assembled at BlueOval City’s Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, Ford officials said. Originally, it was supposed to start production this year.
""It will launch with the launch of the full-size pickup,"" Lawler said of that plant. ""So there is a delay there of about 18 months versus what we were planning earlier. We'll continue to build out construction, and we'll continue to get that plant ready for production and move forward.""
Lawler added that there are no plans to cancel any current offerings, such as the Lightning and Mach-E.
Pre-production sketch of the F-150 Lightning
At the same time, Ford plans to introduce an all-new, fully electric commercial van that will begin production in 2026 in Ohio. That follows a plan for Ford to focus electrification, and offerings, in areas where it has ""competitive advantages"": commercial vans, mid-size and large pickup trucks, and ""long-range"" SUVs.
Ford officials reaffirmed that the so-called ""skunkworks"" plan—meant to develop a low-cost EV platform with a team out of California that's designed to take on Tesla and China—will continue. This platform is expected to produce several vehicles, including a crossover and commercial vehicles.
But this is the first time Ford has confirmed that the truck coming out of it will be a midsize one, not a compact one. It is ""expected to cater to customers who want more for their money—more range, more utility, more useability,"" Ford said in a news release.
Lawler declined to elaborate on whether this truck would be sized more like the smaller Maverick or the Ranger, one size up.
Lawler said that Ford has ""multiple hybrid technologies under development,"" and is working on other powertrain options. ""And then we're going to continue to provide gas vehicles and diesel vehicles, because there's a demand for those and that's going to continue,"" he said.
Previously, Ford's planned three-row electric SUV—which Ford CEO Jim Farley once described as a ""personalized bullet train""—was merely delayed to 2027. Now it will not be made at all, replaced instead by hybrid models.
This does mean Ford will lose $400 million in sunk costs on that vehicle, Lawler and others said today. Lawler also reaffirmed that future Super Duty trucks will go hybrid as well.
The revised plan focuses on Ford's profitability, which has been a struggle amid high battery costs and capital costs involved with producing EVs. Ford breaks out its electric Model e division's results separately, and last year it lost $4.7 billion on sales of 116,000 EVs. Though sales of its current models—the Lightning truck, Mach-E crossover and E-Transit van—have been rising, they have not been enough to compensate for those costs, Lawler said.
Lawler added that in the first half of next year, Ford is planning an ""EV Day"" event where it expects to elaborate more on plans for the hybrid three-row SUV, possibly offer more news on production locations and elaborate more its battery strategy.

While battery costs have declined significantly in recent years, they are a persistent headache for many automakers, Ford included. More recently, CEO Farley has been candid about their costs and what they mean for Ford's emphasis on larger vehicles, urging a shift to smaller EVs: “These huge, enormous EVs are never going to make money: the battery is $50,000, even with low-nickel, LFP chemistry,"" he said earlier this summer. ""They will never be affordable.”
Ford EV Battery
Part of Ford's announcements today also dealt with how and where it sources EV batteries from, which it says will be key to driving costs down.
The automaker said it, and partner LG Energy Solutions, will attempt to move some Mustang Mach-E battery production from Poland to Michigan next year to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act incentives. The BlueOval SK joint venture in Kentucky should start battery production for the Lightning and E-Transit next year; BlueOval City in Tennessee should get underway in late 2025 as well, to make batteries for the new electric commercial van. ""Those same cells will be sourced to later power the next-generation electric truck to be assembled at BlueOval City and future emerging technology electrified vehicles,"" the automaker said. ""This common cell strategy gives Ford significant sourcing flexibility for manufacturing across multiple segments and electrified platforms as the market continues to evolve.""
Finally, cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery production in Michigan remains on track for 2026, which Ford says will qualify for IRA incentives as ""America’s first automaker-backed LFP battery plant.""
These moves may put Ford in a position to escape the scathing headlines built on its EV losses in recent years. But they may also come as a disappointment to those who were hoping for a more EV-centric future at Ford, including the three-row SUV or a sooner deployment of the possible Lightning successor. In the interim, however, the focus on hybrids may just put Ford more in line with customer demands—it has seen considerable success with the hybrid F-150 and other models.
""Our focus here is to remake Ford into high growth, higher margin, more capital, efficient and durable business,"" Lawler said. ""And that means these vehicles need to be profitable. And if they're not profitable, based on where the customer is in the market is, we will pivot and adjust and make those tough decisions, and that's what we've done.""

"Is It Better To Lease A New Electric Vehicle, Or Buy A Used One?",https://insideevs.com/news/730652/car-buying-leasing-used-evs/,"Leasing can get you some incredible deals on new EVs right now. But don't count out the used market, either. Here's our guide to both.",2024-08-19 13:15:40,"The electric vehicle market has excellent opportunities for buyers looking to score a deal. Lease specials on some EVs offer super-cheap payments for nicely equipped models, while the pre-owned market presents some fantastic values. A lot of buyers are torn between a new lease or a pre-owned purchase, but luckily for them, we’re here to help.
After all, buying a brand-new EV—either financing or with cash—may not be the smartest move when so many savings are available through other means. Most of the rebates and discounts are focused on the lease programs and the fact that EVs depreciate (right now, anyway) at a much more accelerated rate compared to their ICE counterparts.
A lease allows a customer to score a brand-new car at very affordable payments while hedging against the future resale value.  Some of the staff here at InsdieEVs have scored some great deals on the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Kia EV6. Plus, the technology at work here could evolve significantly in the years to come, so it may not be a bad idea to be flexible when it comes time to look at what’s next.
However, leasing isn’t for everyone and some buyers may not want to get into the constant cycle of payments, or they may not fit the profile of a driver that stays within the mileage uses of most leases. Of course, there are many EV shoppers that could go either way, and that is where things get tricky.
While there isn’t one right answer and it often depends on the budget and goals of the buyer, I’ve handled several cases recently where customers asked my team to explore both new lease deals and pre-owned options.
While the lease payments were super tempting, most of these clients ended up opting for a pre-owned car. I’ll lay out the math as to why they chose this path with a recent case.
Below is a grid of lease deals on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited we did for a customer in NY. We shopped a zero down, 10,000-mile lease for both 24 and 36-month programs with all tax and fees included.
The cheapest payment we found was $642 per month on a 36-month program. That is a total lease cost of $23,112—not bad at all for a car with an outstanding electric range and a retail price of almost $60,000.
We also found one customer a deal on a Certified 2023 Ioniq 5 Limited with about 11,000 miles on the clock.
2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5
This customer wasn’t going to have to pay sales tax on this purchase due to trade equity, but the total cost came out to $39,000. That’s about a $20,000 savings in depreciation compared to the new MSRP.  While electric vehicles are depreciating at an accelerated rate, the biggest drop happens within the first year or two.
This customer was hedging that the used '23 Ioniq 5 was unlikely to drop in value by another $20,000 over the next three years, and it probably isn’t. Even if it lost an additional $15,000 in value, that still puts them about $8,000 ahead when compared to the lease.
This same scenario played out two other times when I was working on deals for both an EV6 and a Volkswagen ID.4. There, the projected depreciation drop on a used model was likely to be less than the fixed total cost of leasing a new car.
Granted, this comparison requires a bit of guesswork as there isn’t data for the value of some five-to-six-year-old EVs, since many of these models haven’t been around that long. And the auto industry is, in many ways, struggling to properly value used EVs.
But it’s probably safe to say that the deprecation curves generally follow the same pattern as ICE cars, in that the worst drop happens within two years, and then it levels out a bit. Furthermore, if you did choose to buy instead of lease, and then held onto that car for a while, the greater financial value you’d get out of that purchase.
For buyers who value lower payments—and having a car that’s always in the warranty period—leasing would be the way to go. Others may prefer the flexibility of ownership that a pre-owned purchase offers since they can trade in later or hold onto that car however they like.
If you are shopping for leases with EV models, make sure to check out the selection of similar pre-owned options. That may end up being a better bang for your buck in the end.

China Was Supposed To Be The Future. Now It's A 'Money Pit',https://insideevs.com/news/730626/china-ev-sales-cm-august/,"The golden goose is no longer laying eggs for car companies. Also: EVs continue to outpace the rest of the market, but with a catch.",2024-08-19 09:44:32,"It wasn't supposed to be like this.
When Western and other Asian car companies started moving into China in force in the 2000s and 2010s, they thought it would be a kind of golden goose that would lay its golden eggs forever.
By the middle of the decade, it had become the largest and most important market for nearly every automaker, whether they were big like General Motors or smaller and more niche like Porsche; by the end of that decade, it became the long-sought key to stability and sustained profits for Tesla. And it drove product decisions that many of us felt in the U.S., Europe and beyond, like the push toward an electric vehicle future driven by China's policies.
Not so anymore. Somehow, none of those ""foreign"" automakers counted on how quickly China's homegrown car companies would accelerate on their own. Now, the latest data shows how their bet on China has turned into a real money pit.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and transportation news, coming soon to your inbox. Sign up here if you want the latest dispatches in email form.
Also on tap today: some good news about EV sales in the U.S., with an asterisk, and a top labor leader is speaking at the Democratic National Convention this week in Chicago. Let's dig in.
Kudos to the Wall Street Journal for gathering so much data on sales and profits from joint ventures in China. But any way you want to look at the charts in that story, things are pretty bleak.
As has been reported extensively here and elsewhere, car buyers in China are turning pretty exclusively to homegrown Chinese brands, which have become more advanced in software and battery tech and are better suited to their individual tastes. I hope our friends at the Journal don't mind, but I'll borrow one such chart that shows how GM's profits from Chinese joint ventures are going:
No other way to say it: ouch.
This is especially tough when you consider how much the ""foreign"" automakers staked on China. The Volkswagen Group, and its namesake brand, have never had such a huge market share in the U.S., for example; not like it does in Europe and Latin America. Stellantis has some truck brands here, for the most part. And GM and Ford have largely absconded from Europe in recent years too.
So basically, if they lose China—and many of them have already—they're toast. Even Tesla, which helped send China's EV sector into overdrive, is getting a ""thanks, but no thanks"" from buyers these days.
It's bad, but hey, things can always get worse. From the story:
Chrysler owner Stellantis pulled out of manufacturing cars in China in 2022 after its JV that made Jeeps filed for bankruptcy. But it returned to the country a year later by buying a roughly 20% stake in Chinese EV startup Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology. Last month a new JV between the two companies shipped a first batch of Leapmotor EVs to Europe.
[...] Tesla’s share of revenue from China slipped to less than a fifth in the first half of 2024, down from more than a quarter at the 2021 peak.
Manufacturers from China’s Asian neighbors aren’t faring better, according to the latest results. Toyota’s Chinese JV income fell 73% in the quarter through June compared with the same period of 2023, while Honda’s equity income was all but wiped out.
“Global automakers in China still haven’t found a bottom,” said Tu Le, managing director of industry research firm Sino Auto Insights.
That, and they increasingly have to compete with China's automakers on their home turf, especially where the Europeans are concerned—or markets they though they'd own forever like Latin America.
Maybe the approach is ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,"" like Stellantis is doing with Leapmotor. But that's surely now how these car companies envisioned the Chinese market playing out for them once.
Kia EV9
Meanwhile in America, every day we see evidence that counters the ""EV sales are down"" headlines you read everywhere else. Let's take June's registrations. According to the latest from S&P Global Mobility, new EV registrations rose 3.1% year-over-year that month (the latest month where the full data was available) which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize the overall car market is down 8.8% since 2023.
Blame high interest rates, among other things.
The biggest concern to me isn't sales; it's how long these tax incentives, discounts and deals will exist that are clearly driving a lot of EV adoption. I'm certainly not convinced they'll stick around forever. Here's Automotive News with more:
""The June month numbers were good for EVs,"" said Kent Chiu, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""But behind them were pretty strong incentives as a motivator.""
Discounts on some mainstream electric crossovers climbed as high as $18,000 per vehicle, a number unheard of for their gasoline and hybrid counterparts, according to data from Motor Intelligence. The average incentive on the Kia EV9 in June was $18,081, Motor Intelligence said.
Toyota's battery-electric bZ4x crossover had incentives of $11,761 on average in June, according to Motor Intelligence, while the similarly sized RAV4 had just $1,691 per vehicle. The RAV4 comes in gasoline and hybrid versions. Incentives on the electric Nissan Ariya crossover were $14,779 for the month versus $4,267 for the gas-powered Nissan Rogue, Motor Intelligence said.
Some of the incentive money comes indirectly through EV leasing, which allows finance companies to claim the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and pass some or all of it on to consumers. But automakers and their finance arms are not obligated to do so.
Another motivator for EV growth, that story says, is the sheer glut of new options available in 2024. Stuff like the Kia EV9, Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV and even Tesla Cybertruck weren't around last year.
""As more EVs come to market and occupy segments that match internal-combustion vehicles, there will be more consumers that switch over to the EV space,"" Chiu told the outlet.
But the deals probably aren't sustainable forever, so grab one while you can.
UAW Harris Walz
Like it or not, EVs are now a source of considerable partisan bickering in the U.S. and beyond, with the two presidential candidates presenting stark differences in incentives around the policies that are driving their manufacturing and adoption.
I don't doubt we'll hear something about EVs this week as the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago. That's especially true as United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain is set to speak at the convention today.
The UAW is reliably Democratic, even with huge member bases in swing or redder states like Michigan and Ohio, so the Harris campaign is hoping the union will help turn out the votes.
And in typical Fain fashion, he's not pulling punches. From the Detroit News:
Fain has emerged as a top voice for Democrats over the past year in the electoral battleground of Michigan and on the national stage after leading a historic, successful hourly worker strike against major automakers Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV.
The UAW's executive board endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, 10 days after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and Harris launched her campaign.
The Detroit-based union last week launched an operation among its members to mobilize support in Harris' favor, pledged $1.5 million to the Democratic National Committee and filed a federal labor complaint against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
""I am very confident that Vice President Harris, as president, will have our back, just as she has as vice president,"" Fain told The Detroit News in a recent interview. ""And I'm very confident that Donald Trump could care less about working-class people. He's a con man.""
Meanwhile, Trump has seemed to soften somewhat on his anti-EV rhetoric, possibly thanks to his newfound support from Elon Musk. But we expect to hear much more from both sides as election season heats up.

The Volkswagen GTI EV Will Be About 'More Than Just Power',https://insideevs.com/news/730392/volkswagen-id-gti-gokart-handling/,"""It will be a real go-kart,"" a top VW executive says of the electric GTI. ""I’ve driven a prototype and it’s really amazing.”",2024-08-16 08:23:49,"Volkswagen has had its ups and downs as it figures out what an electric future could look like. But one bright spot has been the idea that the GTI badge is coming to an electric vehicle for the first time. Now, VW's technical chief reaffirmed that that car—a GTI version of the upcoming ID.2—should be coming in 2026, and it will keep the focus on handling fun.
According to a recent report published by Autocar, it will have less than 300 horsepower, but it will be very fun to drive. The report quotes Kai Grünitz, who is a VW board member responsible for technical development, and who first of all confirmed that the GTI badge will live on into the age of electric cars.
Grünit said, “GTI is alive and we’ll keep it alive in the future. The GTI badge is about passion, and when we started looking at ideas for an electric GTI, we knew it’s about more than just power.” Volkswagen has so far used GTX branding to define its more powerful electric offerings, like the ID.5 GTX. Still, GTI will be used alongside it in the future—GTX may be used for all-wheel drive vehicles while GTI would be reserved for sporty front-wheel drive models like the upcoming hot ID 2.
It's worth noting that this GTI isn't quite like the GTI most Americans know.
That car is based on the Volkswagen Golf, which is getting an electric version, but one that has been delayed to 2029 as he automaker figures out its software and technical challenges. Instead, this ID.2-based GTI is smaller, more like a Volkswagen Polo in other markets (and has also had its GTI variants over the years.) Since it's smaller than U.S. buyers are used to, it's been unclear whether this one will make it to American dealers.
Instead of the ID.Golf's future-facing platform, the ID.2 will be built on a more affordable front-wheel-drive version of the MEB platform, which will underpin other smaller electric VWs. This is similar to what Kia is doing with the lite version of its E-GMP platform, which ditches 800 volts and rear-wheel drive in the quest to cut costs and make its smaller EVs more affordable.
If you’ve driven any of the current VW ID models, they are competent and drive great, but the driving experience isn’t the most fun, even with power going to the rear wheels. Their safety systems don’t allow any slip at the back, so they always feel glued to the road, and flooring it when coming out of a corner won’t make the rear step out.
So maybe going front-wheel drive and allowing for a bit more movement in the front is the way to go. Grünitz explained that you don’t need a lot of power to make an EV fun. He said, “With an electric car, adding a lot of power is really easy, but do we need 300bhp or 350bhp? With a GTI, what’s more important than power is drivability. It will be a real go-kart. I’ve driven a prototype and it’s really amazing.”
That sounds very encouraging, especially since one of the most fun affordable electric cars is the Mini Cooper SE, which allows you to turn off the traction and stability aids and just do smoky FWD burnouts all the time. With all the nannies off, driving the Cooper SE spiritedly around a twisty road is one of the best times you will ever have behind the wheel of an EV at any price, and it has less than 200 hp.
Mini prides itself on offering a go-kart-like driving experience in its vehicles, including its EVs. The combination of stiff suspension, which may make the car feel a bit bouncy over some uneven road surfaces, and very sharp and sensitive steering is what makes the driving experience feel go-kart-esque, so VW is probably drawing inspiration from that for its ID 2 GTI.
We know it’s possible to have fun in a relatively low-powered front-wheel-drive EV, and the VW exec seems very confident that the upcoming GTI will deliver on the fun front, so we’re eager to try it. And if you were wondering if the electric GTI is coming to the U.S., we asked VW about it, and it sounds like people within the company are pushing hard to make that happen.

"Hyundai Ioniq 9 May Debut At LA Auto Show, Kia EV4 In Q1 2025: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/729921/hyundai-ioniq-9-kia-ev4-la-auto-show-debut/,Local reports suggest that Hyundai is in the final phases of testing the Ioniq 9 in South Korea.,2024-08-12 17:59:52,"Electric vehicle sales may be up and down this year, but the Hyundai Motor Group is pushing forward with its EV plans. We already know that some of HMG's upcoming models include the Hyundai Ioniq 9 and the Kia EV4. Now Korean publication Newsis, citing industry sources, is reporting that production version of the Ioniq 9 may debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show (Nov 22-Dec 1) later this year. The report says the EV4 could arrive next spring.
HMG was the second best-selling electric car brand in the U.S. behind Tesla in the second quarter of this year. It posted outstanding 74% year-over-year EV sales growth on the back of its successful E-GMP-based models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 and the Kia EV6 and the EV9. Now the Korean automaker is looking to its upcoming models to further strengthen its already robust line-up of EVs.
It was widely expected that Hyundai's equivalent to the Kia EV9 would be named the Ioniq 7, after the automaker showcased the ""Seven Concept"" back in 2021. But the automaker later changed that name to Ioniq 9, possibly turning it into a flagship and opening up room for smaller Ioniq 7 or Ioniq 8 models in different segments. It's expected to ride on the same E-GMP platform, offer three rows of seating and similar powertrain options as the EV9. The Korean outlet reports that Hyundai has been testing this model since March and is currently conducting final quality inspections.
Over at Kia, there's a high-riding four-door electric model in the pipeline. The automaker released images of the EV4 concept last year and it's hard to tell if it's a hatchback, sedan or a mix of both. The press images showcase a more angular fastback-esque version of the EV6 that Kia is calling an ""entirely new type of EV sedan."" Newsis reports that it will be positioned above the affordable EV3 hatchback—on sale in Korea and expected to arrive in the U.S. next year—and have similar powertrain and battery options.
The EV3 is already a smash hit on its home turf. It amassed over 10,000 reservations in less than a month after its launch. Company executives have labeled it a ""game changer."" Kia also sold a record number of EVs in the U.S. in the first six months of this year on the back of a largely positive reception to the three-row EV9.
Now Hyundai will hope to replicate that success for the newer and possibily fancier Ioniq 9. Local assembly of the seven-seater at the under construction ""Meta Plant"" outside Atlanta, Georgia should also help the automaker achieve that goal. It will hopefully qualify for the federal tax credit when it arrives. As more details surface, we'll keep you in the loop.

Why Are EV Sales 'Lagging'? Here Are Two Reasons.,https://insideevs.com/news/729698/ev-sales-tesla-chevy-bolt/,If EV sales are slowing at all—and the data is deeply inconsistent—then two types of cars tell us a lot.,2024-08-09 15:40:55,"First, the word ""lagging"" is in quotes both there and in that headline for a reason. That's because I don't really believe that electric vehicle sales are cratering as hard as many headlines would have you believe. It's an easy and clicky narrative to run with, but the truth is much more nuanced. Still, that's the narrative the entire industry seems to have adopted this year.
It's true that EV sales in 2024 aren't proving to be on this predictable, up-and-to-the-right growth curve that automakers and their suppliers hoped for. It's also true that many brands are up on electric sales while others are down, that an upcoming election that could reset emissions rules and incentives is throwing everything into turmoil, that charging networks are taking longer than expected to build out, that most Western and other Asian automakers are getting hammered by homegrown competition in China and that high interest rates are likely to make 2024 a down year for all cars across the board.
An all-electric future
Nearly all automakers have committed to going all-electric at some point in the future, some with harder and firmer dates than others. But a mix of complicated factors has led many to reevaluate their plans instead.
But the doom-and-gloom is hard to buy when you see that Ford's EV sales were up 31% in July alone, or that Hyundai and Kia are seeing rising sales, or that General Motors has more affordable models in the pipeline. Any of those automakers could hit 100,000 EVs produced this year, something only Tesla has done to date.
The truth is that a lot of these doubts seem to come when you consider EV sales in aggregate, particularly in America. And there are two reasons those don't look great.
I'll point to this data point from The Detroit Free Press (subscription required), which today had an excellent and in-depth look at uneven EV adoption and what it means for the paper's Big Three hometown automakers. Let's dig in:
U.S. EV adoption is growing at a pace more sluggish than most carmakers and experts had predicted. Cox Automotive said in June its full-year forecast puts EV purchases this year at about 1.3 million vehicles, or 8.3% of total new car sales, a slight boost from last year, when EV market share was 7.6%.
But Cox had expected EV sales to be closer to 9.5% of total sales for the year. Part of the reason for the reduced forecast was an unexpectedly large sales decline from U.S. EV leader Tesla and the slow launch of affordable EVs by General Motors.
I can't, in good faith, pin all of the EV adoption troubles on those two factors. But they have a lot to do with what's going on. Basically, without the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV—the $25,000-ish twins that carried GM's electric sales on their back for years until their discontinuation at the end of 2023—you get sales data without a significant player.
Since the Bolt duo sold almost 63,000 examples last year, the net effect is almost like saying the SUV segment would be in decline if Ford had stopped making the Expedition. It's not quite that high, but it's in the same galaxy. GM sold nearly as many Bolts alone as Ford sold EVs in 2023.
And with the Bolt phased out and nothing to make up for it—save for whatever remaining Bolts were on dealer lots at the start of this year—of course, EV sales would be down in aggregate. While GM has high hopes for the affordable Equinox EV, and I do too, it's going to be a long time before it hits Bolt levels of critical mass. If it ever does.
Still, things are looking up. GM hit a new quarterly record for EV sales in Q2 of this year. But if it's to break annual records, all Ultium EV models will have to come together to compensate for the lack of the Bolt models—and then hold the line until a reborn Bolt EUV debuts next year.
And then there's Tesla.
Let's just put it this way: when the clear, global market leader in EVs fails to keep its lineup of cars updated amid intensifying new competition, focuses on AI and robots instead of selling cars and has a CEO whose antics are pushing people away from the brand, sales are going to drop. And they are. Sales of non-Tesla EVs are surging, and as Bloomberg has reported all year, any EV slowdown seems to be a Tesla slowdown specifically. The Cybertruck won't save the company; some 90% of its sales are of the Model 3 and Model Y duo, and while the Model 3 got a decent update, the worldwide best-selling Model Y is really showing its age.
So when the company that made up more than 56% of U.S. EV sales last year starts a hard slump, then yes, it brings all total EV sales down with them. The loss of the Bolt and the decline of Tesla are creating a great deal of uncertainty in the overall market. It's like a basketball team that loses its two best players at once, like the Spurs in the late 1990s if injuries had somehow taken out Duncan and Robinson at the same time.
Yet the EV market in America in 2024 is faring far better than that. Incentives and deals still underpin it, and those cannot last forever. And the presidential election could disrupt policies that boost sales and incentivize manufacturing in America. But looked at this way, there's nothing to indicate that the influx of new, affordable EV models—the Kia EV3, the reborn Bolt, whatever Ford is planning, and so on—won't be able to juice things again. Plus, automakers are still struggling to make profitable EVs. That's coming sooner than you may think.
Sometimes, it's okay if growth isn't some up-and-to-the-right curve all of the time. It's just hard to squeeze that idea into a headline.

China's MG Motor Is Conquering Europe. Now It Wants To Build A Factory In Mexico,https://insideevs.com/news/729524/mg-motor-conquering-europe-mexico-china/,MG Motor plans to build a manufacturing base and research and development center in Mexico.,2024-08-08 12:00:05,"While the U.S. continues to restrict Chinese electric vehicles from entering its market, its neighbors are increasingly embracing affordable and well-made Chinese EVs.
The latest brand to show interest in capitalizing on the growing Latin American EV market is MG Motor. The former British brand is owned by China’s state-owned SAIC Motor, and it now plans to establish a manufacturing facility and a research and development center in Mexico.
The threat of the Mexico backdoor.
U.S. automakers fear that cheap and well-made Chinese EVs, which are already flooding Mexico, could also enter the U.S. if those brands set-up plants in the country. While U.S. could be a lucrative market for them, it is not the only country they're interested in. They see incomes rising in South America and Latin America as well, where they plan to expand regardless of America's protectionist policies.
By expanding further into Mexico, where it already sells models like the all-electric MG4 and the MG3 hybrid, it would be able to ""not only produce vehicles, but to also produce market intelligence specifically designed for and by Latin America,"" country lead Zhang Wei said in a statement.
The automaker said the Mexico plant, whose construction time and location details weren’t revealed, would help the SAIC Group grow and expand into the Caribbean and Latin America. The expansion would also allow MG Motor to launch its luxury brand, IM, in these markets, something the automaker said is on the cards.
MG Motor already has plants in China, Thailand and India. Plus it's planning to build a factory in Europe, where it is the best-selling Chinese brand with nearly 128,000 units sold in the first half of 2024, as per Dataforce numbers reported by Automotive News.
Mexico is emerging as the hotspot in North America for Chinese EVs. Brands like BYD and Chery Automobile already sell cars in the country. Reuters reported that one in 10 cars sold in Mexico last year were Chinese. Given the pace of Chinese investments in the country, that share will likely continue to grow.
Tesla also plans to build a factory in Mexico, but those plans are on pause as the company awaits the outcome of the presidential elections in November.
If Donald Trump gets elected, it would certainly hurt the U.S. auto industry. He has vowed to amend the U.S. Mexico Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement and slap 100-200% tariffs on cars made in Mexico. A ton of cars sold in the U.S. are made in Mexico, including those from General Motors, Ford, Mazda, Nissan, BMW and countless others.
Those cars should be made in the U.S., he said at the Republican National Convention, implying that he would allow Chinese carmakers to build factories in the U.S. Mexico, however, recently indicated that it was distancing itself from Chinese brands and had reportedly halted talks with BYD after pressure from the U.S.

"America Is Divided: Let China's Automakers Build Here, Or Not?",https://insideevs.com/news/729357/china-us-production-cm/,"Plus, Nissan's former top boss fears a Honda ""takeover,"" and Rivian doubles down on cost-cutting.",2024-08-07 10:40:00,"Like it or not, electric vehicles are a major political football in America's 2024 election. And that ball is constantly in the air. On one side, you have the Biden Administration's taxpayer-funded support of EV production and sales, something that Vice President Kamala Harris and her own VP pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are largely expected to continue. On the other side, you have former President Donald Trump, who has roundly denigrated EVs but is sort of coming around on them thanks to newfound support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
But there's an even bigger and more contentious question this country will have to address in the coming years: Does America allow China's auto industry—which has a very clear lead on EV technology—to build cars on our shores, or do we work to continue keeping them out?
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning tech and EV news roundup. Also on tap: famed former Nissan-Renault boss Carlos Ghosn has words for the new Nissan-Honda partnership, and Rivian gets serious about cost-cutting.
BYD Song Plus DM-i
We've addressed that question before. As InsideEVs contributor Ed Niedermeyer wrote recently, affordable EVs don't just happen; perhaps there's a way for China and America to work together in ways that are both mutually beneficial and stabilizing.
After all, think of the jobs that manufacturers like Toyota, Hyundai and BMW have brought to America with their factory options. Could BYD do the same over here? In a best case scenario, that could lead to tie-ups where American automakers get some EV knowledge (much as China once did when ramping up its industry) and maybe even defuse some tensions between two major geopolitical rivals.
Also, it was Trump, of all people, who suggested China's automakers just come here. I did not have that development on my bingo card for 2024.
But we're too probably too divided to go for it, and that stretches across party lines in America. A recent article from Hong Kong's South China Morning Post illustrates the Chinese perspective on all of this. (I'd add that the Post has had its independence from the ruling party questioned in recent years, but I'm including it here with that caveat so you an read it and make up your own mind.)
Some highlights:
Amid already substantial tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries – and fiery rhetoric against Chinese investment – Trump’s invitation has the potential to change the course of the US transition to EVs as well as open doors to Chinese business in a segment that has so far appeared closed.
Though far from fully fleshed out, his pitch is in line with a growing recognition worldwide of China’s critical role to the development of the EV industry and suggests an emerging split within the Republican Party about the future of Chinese industrial investment on US soil.
But such plans triggered local opposition. At a roundtable last Friday, Representative John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House select committee on China, focused on the ties between Chinese companies and the Chinese Communist Party in opposing any role for Gotion in America.
“I want to see this area have more jobs and investment but we must not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the enemy,” Moolenaar said, addressing an audience in Michigan’s rural Green Charter Township, where one of the plants would be built.
And as I mentioned, this isn't even a partisan thing. Many industry groups and even Democrats say ""hell no"" to this plan as well:
Scott Paul, the head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing trade group, called it a “foolish” idea. “At a time when many new and established brands are just scaling up EV production, [a] Beijing-backed Chinese auto juggernaut could wipe them out.”
Democrats, too, have expressed scepticism about letting Chinese carmakers into the US, trying to strike a balance between embracing a green future and guarding against potential national security risks.
“The Biden administration worries that Chinese cars, given the number of sensors and cameras and other sorts of devices on them, are essentially, as Gina Raimondo has said, ‘spy cameras on wheels’,” said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to Biden’s Commerce secretary.
Or, as analyst Michael Dunne also suggests, America could just make these automakers enter into a joint venture with our companies. After all, China did that to everyone else:
“I want the jobs, bring the capital, bring the know-how, and we have to trust American ingenuity to be able to absorb that and run with it,” Michael Dunne, founder of the Dunne Insights consultancy, contended on The Global Lithium podcast.
Dunne, a former General Motors executive, said the US ought to take a page from China’s playbook from the 1980s: encourage joint ventures to build up its auto industry.
“We’ll own a majority share. You have minority, but you get access to our lucrative market. And over time we hope to be able to learn how you make batteries.”
Finally, one analyst actually thinks Trump is more likely to go for it than a Democratic president:
But if Trump sought to encourage such investment, analysts said, he might not need the support of Republican lawmakers. And compared to his Democratic counterparts, they say, the former president is less vulnerable to being seen as weak on China, giving him more flexibility to invite Chinese firms in.
“Trump can do a lot to influence his party on this type of policy because he doesn’t need Congress to approve foreign direct investment,” said Jack Zhang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas, adding that foreign auto plants have previously found receptive audiences in red states for the jobs they bring.
It's all fascinating. And certainly unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. There are also some gray areas here, like allowing more battery manufacturers in before we allow full-blown car factories.
But I do believe that the anti-China tariffs are a temporary situation at best. Those automakers will be selling EVs and hybrids in America someday; capitalism finds a way, even their flavor of it. America just needs to figure out what terms that's going to happen on.
We know that Japan's automakers are freaked out about their lateness in developing EV technology, and the rise of China is what has them especially spooked. We also know that they're circling the wagons and turning to joint ventures and team-ups to stay ahead.
The latest one is a deal between Honda and Nissan, but these days, the former is in a much stronger position in terms of profits and sales than the latter. So former Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi megaboss Carlos Ghosn—speaking to Automotive News from self-imposed exile in Lebanon following his flight from Japanese authorities—worries that Nissan is just going to get eaten here:
""Signing an alliance is the easy part. Now, making the alliance work is a completely different story,"" Ghosn told Automotive News on Aug. 5 from Lebanon, where he lives as a fugitive from Japanese authorities after jumping bail in December 2019 and fleeing the country hidden in a box.
Indeed, many details of the Nissan-Honda deal, including funding and investment, are up in the air. Meanwhile, adding Mitsubishi to the mix brings another voice that could complicate discussions.
[...] ""I can't imagine for one moment how it's going to work between Honda and Nissan unless it's a takeover, unless it's a disguised takeover by Honda of Nissan and Mitsubishi with Honda in the driver's seat,"" Ghosn said. ""It's going to be a takeover, a disguised takeover.""
Nissan and Honda haven't discussed capital cross-holdings between each other, Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida and Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said at their joint news conference.
But Mibe added that he isn't ruling it out.
The partners are considering many options, perhaps even setting up a new company, the Honda boss added. Honda took that approach in establishing a separate EV venture with electronics and tech giant Sony.
Ghosn is right about the culture clash. They may both be Japanese car companies, but they're very different ones. One is an engineering-led firm that's been largely independent and has had few tie-ups over the years, and the other is infamous for its bureaucracy, inconsistent decisions and utter chaos since the Ghosn scandal. And Nissan's ties to Renault are equally messy, with fewer obvious returns for either company.
Again, I do think this is the start of an era of consolidation for the Japanese auto industry, with Honda and Nissan on one side and Toyota, Subaru and Mazda on the other. But Nissan's not going into this one from a position of strength at all.
Second Gen Rivian R1T and R1S
We didn't get a ton of new-news out of Rivian's Q2 earnings call last night. But as CNBC reports, it beat analyst expectations yet still lost $1.46 billion—up from $1.2 billion a year earlier. Rivian officials also said the comoany remains on track for a positive gross profit during the fourth quarter.
More from that report:
The second-quarter results come more than a month after Rivian held an investor day that focused on cost-cutting efforts, efficiency gains and in-house technologies and software. The event came days after Rivian announced plans for Volkswagen to invest up to $5 billion in the EV startup, starting with an initial investment of $1 billion.
Shares of Rivian are off 37% this year amid slower-than-expected demand for EVs as well as Rivian’s significant cash burn. The stock closed Tuesday at $14.80, up 1.3%.
Rivian, which is still losing thousands of dollars for every vehicle it makes, has been focused on reducing costs. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in June that efficiencies earlier this year in products and manufacturing are expected to lead to 20% material cost reductions in its current vehicles, followed by 45% targeted reductions in its upcoming “R2” vehicles, which are projected to begin production in early 2026.
In other words, Rivian is learning, getting better and seems to be trending in the right direction. But it needs to keep the juice going until the R2 can make its debut, and 18 months (if not more) can feel like forever in the EV world.

Are 51% Of Tesla Buyers Switching Back To Gas? Absolutely Not.,https://insideevs.com/news/729112/edmunds-tesla-trade-ins-debunked/,A recent story suggested that over half of Tesla owners trade into gas cars. That's not true.,2024-08-05 16:37:22,"EV skeptics rejoiced at recent data from Edmunds, which claimed that over 50% of Tesla buyers were trading in their EVs for gas cars. There's just one problem with that stat: It's not true. Or more specifically, it's far from a complete picture.
Edmunds has a lot of great data, and it's a highly reputable source for new car transaction data and car testing data. We rely on all of it very regularly here. But their sales data has one core limitation: It comes from traditional car dealerships and only covers trade-ins.
As EIC Patrick George already explained in a recent story, anyone who knows Tesla knows why that data can't fully capture Tesla owner behavior. Tesla doesn't have dealerships.
EV Loyalty
Many early adopters have proven stunningly loyal to EVs. But as the products are reaching a wider audience, more people are saying they'd be interested in going back to a gas car. That trend is real, but not nearly as broad as some people have claimed.
Tesla sells its vehicles through directly owned company stores, which aren't included in Edmunds' dataset. We noted that the sample missed Tesla owners who switched to new Teslas, as well as those who replaced their cars with Rivians, Lucids or even VinFasts, all of which are sold outside of dealer networks.
Now, a new video from our friends at EV Buyers Guide expands on our intuition, showing data from S&P Global that captures a wider section of the market. It used new vehicle registration data along with data about when a car is no longer registered to an address, giving it a picture of the market that includes Tesla shoppers who buy another Tesla, those who have their cars totaled and get something else without trading in and those who sell or buy their next vehicle privately.
In short: It's the full picture. And it's a lot rosier for EV fans.
The first thing that sticks out is how much Edmunds misses by not including Tesla's store data. A whopping 70% of Tesla owners simply get another Tesla, an incredible loyalty figure. Another 10% buy other EVs, Rivian winning 9.8% of those customers who switch.
Just 13% of buyers traded their Teslas in for gas cars. Of the remaining buyers, 4% get hybrids, 2% get plug-in hybrids and 1% get diesels.
That's a far cry from the 51% number, which is what the Edmunds data suggested. It also includes buyers switching to brands like Ram or Aston Martin, which don't really make the same types of vehicles that Tesla does.
But there's a caveat to this data, that makes it worth watching the whole video. As Alex explains, the vast majority of Tesla sales have happened in the last few years, as the brand has transitioned from a niche player to a dominant juggernaut. That may have weird effect on the data, as Alex explains.
But while the data has its own limitation, one thing is clear: Most Tesla buyers aren't going back to gas cars. Don't get it twisted.

Why Mercedes Is Copying BMW's Homework On Future EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/729055/mercedes-bmw-ev-strategy/,"The ""jellybean"" thing didn't work out for Mercedes. Plus, Lucid and Rivian report their finances soon and Ford makes bank on fleet trucks.",2024-08-05 10:00:27,"When automakers kicked off their electric vehicle arms race a few years ago, their plans ran on a lot of assumptions. One of the biggest was that customers would just show up for EVs like they have for their other cars—loyal Audi owners would buy Audi EVs, Mercedes owners would buy Mercedes EVs, and so on. But many of them neglected to think that their EVs would have to be actually good for customers to make that leap.
Now, they're looking to adjust their plans as the EV takeoff wasn't as direct as they expected, and Mercedes is a perfect example. That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of tech and industry news. Also on deck today: Rivian and Lucid prepare to report Q2 earnings and Ford's ""dirty"" secret when it comes to profits. Let's go.
2024 Merceds G 580 With EQ Technology First Drive -- Electric G-Class
Like I said, the EV transition was built on assumptions. (The other big one was that the EV charging infrastructure would just kind of ""show up"" around these cars like the gas station network once did, but that wasn't the case, so now the automakers are doing it themselves in various ways.)
Mercedes made some wrong assumptions about the EQ-branded EVs. They're not all bad, of course—the range on some of them is excellent, the Hyperscreen is rad and I'm weirdly partial to the EQE sedan—but their super-aerodynamic ""jellybean"" style hasn't delivered the kind of presence and stateliness that Mercedes buyers expect. And cars like the EQS just don't feel as nice or as premium as a proper S-Class, somehow.
So the plan moving forward is to eventually phase out the special, standalone EQ cars and do more vehicles like the new G-Class: same body but in gas or electric form.
As Automotive News points out today, that's basically what BMW is doing too. It offers gas, electric and hybrid versions of many of its most popular cars, along with some standalone versions of each like the iX, XM or M3, to give some examples. Here's more:
Mercedes-Benz is bringing 25 new and updated models to showrooms this year, including entry and midsegment vehicles such as the redesigned E-Class and new plug-in hybrid GLC crossover.
The automaker is backing off its electric vehicle push as U.S. consumers cool to its zero-emission offerings.
At a meeting in April, Mercedes told retailers it would boost combustion engine and hybrid vehicle supply in 2024. The automaker plans to expand its plug-in hybrid offerings in the second half with the GLC.
The automaker is tweaking product development plans and taking a page from rival BMW. Future models will share platforms and support gasoline-only, hybrid and electric powertrains. Mercedes will ditch the jelly bean design and EQ branding on future EVs.
But this doesn't mean Mercedes is abandoning EVs, as some outlets have implied. There's a new electric cargo van coming, a high-performance AMG model, the new ""electric first"" CLA-Class family and more. Meanwhile, a number of EQ models will be updated and conventional cars like the E-Class and S-Class are getting hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains, if they don't have them already.
The plan certainly worked well for BMW, which has a higher EV share of sales than most and gives loyal customers other options too. No reason it can't work for Mercedes either.
Lucid-Rivian
Overall, the second quarter wasn't exactly spectacular for most automakers. While several posted more strong EV sales, car sales, in general, are down as interest rates remain high and the companies themselves face steep capital ramp-up costs—or are scrambling to fix various quality issues.
So how will the startups stack up? Lucid's earnings call is this evening and Rivian's is tomorrow and we'll be covering both. Lucid is coming off a record sales quarter, but it's still dogged by enormous costs that will keep profits well on the horizon for now. We may hear more about the Gravity SUV, expected to be a much bigger volume-seller than the Air sedan.
As for Rivian, it has said that it expects to be ""gross profit positive"" by Q4 of 2024, but we'll learn more about that trajectory soon. Rivian's shares were bolstered by the big investment and tech joint venture with Volkswagen, but that's going to be a long-term play and probably not something that yields immediate, overnight returns.
More on both stories as we learn more.
Ford Pro EV charging
Ford is fairly unique among automakers because it breaks out financial results for its EV division separately from its gas and commercial divisions. That's made it a bit of a punching bag for investors, who want profits and returns right now, but any EV supply chain and production system is going to take time and money to build out—investors love Tesla and it burned cash there for well over a decade.
But Ford has a secret weapon that's both paying the bills and keeping its EV division afloat: the Ford Pro commercial division, CNBC reports:
But Ford has proven that’s not always the case by breaking out financial results for its “Ford Pro” fleet business. The operations have raked in about $18.7 billion in adjusted earnings and $184.5 billion in revenue since 2021.
Such results have led Wall Street to praise the business, as analysts have called it a “hidden gem” and Ford’s “Ferrari,” referring to the highly profitable Italian sports car manufacturer.
Automakers, including Ford, also see fleet operations as a key driver in other ways, including for electric vehicle sales, as well as reoccurring revenue options such as software and logistical services.
“This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency,” [CEO Jim] Farley said during the quarterly call. “The major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro.”
This is interesting for a few reasons. For one, EVs are a big part of these commercial plans, as are traditional gas-powered vans and trucks. And General Motors and Stellantis are jealous, so they're trying to ramp up similar commercial operations as well:
Unlike retail customers, many fleet and commercial customers have predefined routes or schedules that could accommodate EVs well because they drive locally in a region and could charge overnight when electricity costs are lower.
All three of the legacy Detroit automakers are touting such advantages to their fleet customers, while still offering traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.
Stellantis and Ford also have started highlighting their portfolios of different powertrains such as hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as adoption of EVs has not occurred as quickly as many had expected.
Ford last month announced plans valued at about $3 billion to expand Super Duty production, including to “electrify” Super Duty trucks.
“We’ve gone to, on all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform so we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have,” Farley said during the earnings call. “We believe we will be a first mover, if not the first mover, in multi-energy Super Duty.”
But all of them know that if they can't get consumer-focused EVs right—and profitable—the commercial truck and van business might be all they do someday.

Why A Failed Startup’s Cheap EVs Are Piling Up In This Junkyard,https://insideevs.com/news/728795/electrameccanica-solo-junkyard-arizona/,Remember the ElectraMeccanica Solo? This is its final resting place.,2024-08-02 07:49:55,"With a driving range of around 100 miles on a full charge, a body smaller than the ill-fated Smart ForTwo and just three wheels, the ElectraMeccanica Solo EV was touted as the solution to boring commutes. The company’s CEO, Jerry Kroll, even went as far as saying that the diminutive battery-powered city runabout would be “as ubiquitous as the iPhone within a year.”
That was in 2018. Now, The majority of Solo EVs are ending up in an Arizona scrapyard, as @startupslick on TikTok recently discovered (and was then covered by The Autopian). But why?
Solo if you choose to keep your Solo
ElectraMeccanica's voluntary buyback program for the 429 Solo EVs affected by an issue that could lead to a loss of motive power is just that: voluntary. That means you could still see third-gen Solos pop up for sale from people who wanted to keep them instead of selling them back to the manufacturer. That said, if you plan on buying one, be aware that there's no support whatsoever from its maker.
The short answer is that the company started a voluntary buyback program for 429 units which could suddenly lose motive power. Why didn’t they just do a normal recall, like car companies usually do? Well, ElectraMeccanica didn’t actually know how to fix the issue, so they chose to buy back the affected three-wheelers from their owners.
And it’s these units that ended up the the Arizona junkyard you see in the TikTok video embedded below. According to the uploader, who said he talked to a scrapyard employee, the EVs can’t be parted out–except for the seats–so their fate will ultimately be the crusher.
ElectraMeccanica actually built more units than the 429 that were part of the voluntary buyback program and even got to the delivery part, which is usually the most difficult one to undertake if you’re a startup.
The single-seaters that are piling up in the junkyard were built in China by ElectaMeccanica’s strategic investor, Zongshen Industrial Group, which assembled another 300 units prior to starting U.S. deliveries, but those EVs were reportedly scrapped, according to Robert Dunn of Aging Wheels, who owns two Solos.
The company unveiled the production model in 2016 and a year later, limited (hand-built) production began in Vancouver, Canada. About 180 of these first-gen models were assembled but just about 40 or so reached customers, according to various reports online. Then, in 2019, production of the second-gen version began in China–those 300 or so units that weren’t actually sold, with the third-gen model finally hitting the assembly line in 2021.
ElectraMeccanica Solo Ev 8
Deliveries in the U.S. started in the same year, but even if the issue that led to the recall and subsequent buyback had been fixed, the Solo EV was a tough pill to swallow from the get-go. With a starting price of $18,500 and an interior that looked like the Fisher Price version of a Chevrolet Spark–not to mention it could only seat one person–it wasn’t a particularly attractive deal.
As for why didn’t ElectraMeccanica fix the cars instead of scrapping them, it’s unclear, but it could have to do with the fact that the brand was purchased by electric truck company Xos, which seemingly doesn’t want to have anything to do with the ill-fated three-wheelers.
In a response to an email sent by The Drive, a Xos representative said: “Following the recall, buyback, and ElectraMeccanica’s cessation of sales, the vehicles were disposed of partly via the facility in [the] linked video. Following the acquisition by Xos, ElectraMeccanica's few remaining operations have been wound down.”
It’s worth noting that you could still see some third-gen Solo EVs pop up for sale once in a while, seeing how the buyback was voluntary, but if you’re trying to convince yourself that it’s a good deal, bear in mind that there’s absolutely no support from the factory anymore.
In other words, you’d be solo in your adventure.

"Yes, Electric Vehicles Are Cheaper In 2024. Here's How Much",https://insideevs.com/news/728237/ev-cheaper-critical-materials/,"But automakers face all kinds of financial headwinds for different reasons. Plus, the Honda Prologue gets a recall already.",2024-07-29 10:30:21,"I think it's fair to say that the Inflation Reduction Act—the Biden Administration's omnibus spending bill aimed at clean energy, infrastructure, health care reform and much more—has had its share of headaches when it comes to driving electric vehicle sales.
Few people understand the tax incentive scheme for EVs and plug-in hybrids, chargers and battery factories take years to build out, and the roster of eligible cars changed so much in 2024 alone that updating the list kept us pretty busy here at InsideEVs.
But when it comes to reducing EV buying costs, guess what? It's working.
That kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of what's new in the world of tech, transportation and our pivot to an electrified future. Also on deck: car companies faced financial headwinds in Q2 of 2024 for different reasons, and the Honda Prologue faces a recall you may want to know about.
2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium
One mark against EV adoption is that, so far, the cars have just been more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts. There are many reasons for that, but it generally comes down to the still-high cost of batteries and the fact that EVs depend on supply chains that aren't nearly as built out as the ones powering gas cars for the past century.
But the IRA is moving the needle in the right direction, according to an Automotive News report from earlier in July that I missed but is worth highlighting here. And as many automakers (but certainly not all) see record EV sales, they have both EV tax credits and leasing loopholes to thank for pushing wider adoption:
[The IRA] has spurred investment plans amounting to billions of dollars in domestic EV assembly plants, battery factories and materials mines.
As it turns out, limits on buyer income and EV sourcing requirements have not raised what consumers, on average, are paying for the vehicles.
Compared with the first quarter of 2022—prior to the legislation—average transaction prices fell $8,600 to $57,584 for purchases in the same period of this year, according to data from J.D. Power. The average transaction price includes legacy automotive brands and Tesla. The average lease transaction price slid $5,900 to $33,553.
There are other reasons, too, like Tesla sparking a price cut war last year that spread nearly across the board. But the leasing loophole in particular—which nets a $7,500 discount via a tax credit at the point of sale—is really pushing things:
On EV leases, one feature of the legislation allowed the tax credit to pass through without sourcing and assembly requirements. The Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit allows lessors — automaker finance arms and other lenders — to pass along the $7,500 credit in a lease, which is considered a commercial transaction. The result is that more consumers can tap the tax credit when leasing, saving them about $1,900 in the transaction price.
EV lease penetration for non-Tesla models typically hovers above 60 percent and stretches to about 90 percent for some Audi and BMW models.
""It is the loophole. You don't have to worry about your income bracket, the MSRP, where the battery minerals were produced,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. ""I think it will continue.""
The problem is that car companies are getting nervous both because they (and their dealers) are taking losses to drive sales. And the IRA incentives are very much up in the air depending on the election results; former President Donald Trump has vowed to end them if re-elected, even as they drive huge investments even in red states like Hyundai's $7.6 billion EV and battery complex in Georgia.
So what happens if all of that goes away? That will be the $200 billion question voters will have to ask themselves as they go to the polls;. However, it's unclear what a potential Harris Administration would do differently here than the Biden Administration; we can all presume the policies won't be that dissimilar.
Ford F-150 Lightning
Let's be real: Q2 wasn't a great one for the automotive industry. Sure, loss related to EV production is part of that, but the biggest problem has been high interest rates. Those have thwarted sales of things like big trucks and SUVs that carmakers really depend on for profits.
There are also automaker-specific problems, like Tesla's aging lineup (and other matters) slowing down sales, Ford's sky-high warranty costs amid a long-running quality crisis, or Stellantis' sinking Jeep sales... it's a lot right now.
However, the Wall Street Journal points out something I strongly agree with: people are just sick of the crazy new car prices, which jumped heavily during and after the pandemic. New cars that cost $50,000 on average are fine when interest rates are nearly zero, but not when they hover around 8%:
One particular concern among auto investors has grown louder: The strong pricing power that carmakers have enjoyed in the pandemic era is slowly fading. Several auto executives warned that in the second half of the year, they expect the average price paid by customers will edge lower.
“The results of our competitors are not demonstrating that price pressure is going to vanish,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, which also makes Ram vehicles.
Car companies for years have made the case that they are ready to become technology companies, with plans to transform cars into battery-powered smartphones on wheels. Those ambitions, coupled with an unprecedented run of profitability fueled by stout pricing, lifted stocks.
Wall Street’s enthusiasm for that vision has faded, as U.S. electric-vehicle demand hasn’t taken off as expected. Now, with signs that pricing is losing steam as the American car buyer grapples with high interest rates, investors are looking for reasons to stick around.
“The overarching feeling for the auto industry is that the good times can’t last,” said Martin French, managing director at auto consulting firm Berylls Strategy Advisors.
That's funny because I wouldn't exactly call the pandemic supply chain shenanigans of the early 2020s ""good times."" However, automakers are trying to sell Wall Street in the future, not in the present: EVs, autonomy, their approach to technology, and more.
“The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during his Q2 call last week. The same could be said of all of them.
2024 Honda Prologue Elite
It's only 39 units (for now), but if you bought a Honda Prologue recently, be advised your new GM-made EV is facing a recall. Here's the NHTSA to fill you in:
Honda (American Honda Motor Co.) is recalling certain 2024 Prologue vehicles. The right front lower control arm may contain a manufacturing defect that can cause it to fracture.
Dealers will inspect and replace the right front lower control arm as necessary, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed September 2, 2024. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. Honda's number for this recall is PIY.
Equinox EV Range
After driving the affordable Chevy Equinox EV, I'm feeling pretty good about GM's Ultium play—it's giving that company the scale it needs to build EVs across many brands at many price points for years to come. GM has also upped its software game considerably this year.
Who else is doing the hard work right now that will pay off tomorrow and beyond?

The Porsche Cayenne Is Going Electric. Just Not Entirely,https://insideevs.com/news/727932/porsche-cayenne-electric-teaser/,"The next generation Cayenne will be all-electric. But the current one is sticking around with some upgrades too, just in case.",2024-07-25 18:00:54,"For the first time, Porsche has officially shown off the fourth-generation Cayenne, albeit with heavy camouflage. But it's no secret that this time, it's also a rival to the likes of Tesla and Rivian when it goes on sale sometime in 2025 or 2026. But Porsche's also got a back-up plan of sorts if those buyers aren't ready to go fully electric.
Unlike the Porsche Macan, which now exists solely as an EV (some older gas units are still on sale in the U.S.), Porsche is taking no such risks with the Cayenne. That means adopting a multi-pronged approach by offering multiple powertrain options. That’s in line with industry trends as automakers recalibrate their EV plans after witnessing uneven sales growth and taking a massive beating in terms of profits.
The future of performance cars is electric too.
Electric motors leave gas engines in the dust when it comes to raw performance. We've seen Tesla Model S Plaids and Lucid Air Sapphires destroy even the most expensive gas powered supercars in a straight line. Porsche is going increasingly electric too. It first electrified the Macan and now has an all electric Cayenne in the pipeline.
“In the middle of the decade, the fourth generation will set standards in the segment as an electric SUV,” Oliver Blume, CEO of Porsche AG, said in a statement. “At the same time, into the next decade, our customers will still be able to choose from a wide range of powerful and efficient combustion and hybrid models.” The statement added that the current, third-generation Cayenne ""will be further upgraded and will continue to be offered alongside the fourth, all-electric generation.""
The automaker already sells plug-in hybrid and gas-powered Cayennes in the U.S., Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. In the U.S., the plug-in hybrid is available with both V6 (Cayenne E-Hybrid) and V8 (Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid) engines and has a WLTP range of 56 miles. Its EPA numbers are not available yet.
The Cayenne EV will ride on the same Premium Platform Electric (PPE) as other upscale Volkswagen Group electric models, such as the Macan EV and the Audi Q6 E-Tron. Both have gotten generally excellent reviews so far. Thanks to the PPE’s 800-volt architecture, the Macan EV can charge at 270 kilowatts and is capable of adding a 10-80% range in 21 minutes, so expect similar charging performance from the Cayenne EV, too.
That said, the teaser images don’t give away much, apart from the 911-like cooling ducts upfront and the fact that it retains a similar silhouette as the current gas-powered Cayenne.
However, the Cayenne EV is set to arrive at a time when Porsche is scaling back its once-ambitious EV plans. The automaker previously anticipated that electrified models would account for more than 80% of new car sales by 2030. But Porsche told Reuters this week that now depends on “consumer demand and development of electromobility.”
2024 Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid.
Still, the Cayenne remains a crucial part of Porsche's journey. Porsche launched it in the early 2000s when its financials were ringing the alarm bells. Then the Cayenne arrived, offering buyers a luxurious, spacious, performance-focused and off-road capable family SUV. It prevented Porsche from spiraling downward again, generating profits that were reinvested in the company's indulgent sports car projects.
Over the years, along with the smaller Macan, it has played a big role in keeping Porsche’s balance sheets looking healthy. Now Porsche hopes that the electric model will herald another new era for the brand, similar to how the gas model did back in 2002.

EVs Left These Owners Stranded. But Not For Why You Think,https://insideevs.com/news/727893/evs-owners-stranded-tech-battery/,"Running out of battery power seems like an obvious reason, but that’s not what left owners stranded.",2024-07-25 10:26:42,"Stranded electric vehicles? Must be the battery running out of charge, right? For many, that’s the knee-jerk reaction, an Olympics-style jump to the seemingly obvious conclusion. However, a new study reveals the myriad reasons why EV owners might find themselves stranded.
Toronto-based digital platforms company VerticalScope, the parent company of AutoGuide and other publications, surveyed 1,200 EV owners in a recent poll. It concluded that 9.1% of the respondents were stranded, but the reasons why say more about technology than range.
EVs have some quality issues, but they're improving
EVs are a technological leap. And with that comes a steep learning curve for automakers as they iron out software issues to make ownership seamless. Rivian, GM and many others are already improving their model line-ups with substantial under-the-skin upgrades after early bugs.
Let's first note that this is a relatively small sample size, much smaller than studies conducted by the likes of J.D. Power or Recurrent. So it may not be indicative of broader industry trends, especially now that EVs are starting to fly off the shelves. And as we've covered before, getting stranded in an EV can happen but is vastly less widespread than many people think.
Still, the findings seem somewhat consistent with what we’ve seen before.
The most common issue was purely mechanical, emerging from suspension, drivetrain components or cooling systems required for large batteries. 6.4% of owners reported these problems. 2.1% of owners said they faced software issues.
This has been a recurring theme in the early days of the EV transition. As opposed to traditional gas cars where mechanical systems play the primary role, EVs follow a software-first approach. All major systems in modern EVs (and even gas cars) are controlled by software.
A software issue left us stranded in a Chevy Blazer EV during a road trip last year.
This includes the drivetrain, battery management systems, advanced driver assistance systems, over the air updates and more. Making all that work flawlessly isn’t easy. Many automakers have witnessed a steep learning curve here, including Volkswagen, Rivian and General Motors.
Only 0.6% of the respondents said they were left stranded due to running out of range. That’s only about 7.2 people in a sample size of 1,200, so clearly, people are getting better at planning, charging is getting better and running an EV completely down to 0% is quite rare.
Even though range anxiety is real, it’s not what seems to be causing trouble for EV owners. And it’s almost a non-issue considering that the average daily driving distance for Americans is only 42 miles according to one estimate. Several new EVs now offer a range of over 300 miles.
The study adds that Tesla and BMW fared better than others. Just 7% of Tesla owners and 5% of BMW owners reported getting stranded. None of the Tesla owners faced software issues. Owners of GM vehicles, like the old Chevy Bolt EV and Silverado EV and GMC Hummer EV, as well as Fisker and Nissan owners, faced the most trouble.

Stellantis Is ‘Ready For The Fight’ Against Chinese EVs In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/727678/stellantis-fight-chinese-evs-europe/,"With a new EV production line at the former Yugo factory in Serbia, the auto giant reckons it has what it takes. Will it succeed?",2024-07-24 13:00:02,"The last time we checked, Stellantis had at least 14 car brands under its wings and even more subsidiaries scattered throughout the globe. But even with so much potential power, it–like many other automakers–has struggled to keep up with the influx of Chinese-made electric cars making their way into Europe.
According to Reuters, CEO Carlos Tavares said that the company is “ready to fight” the brutal challenge of the Chinese EV offensive.
Local lithium and cheap workforce
With a new EV assembly line in Serbia and a local supply of lithium, the vital component needed for high-voltage batteries, Stellantis reckons it has what it takes to fight the influx of Chinese-made electric cars making their way into Europe—that, and the fact that it is also assembling a Chinese-made EV in Poland.
""We are going to be challenged and I would say brutally challenged by the Chinese offensive on the European market,"" Tavares said on Monday during the opening of a new EV production line in Serbia which will assemble the new Fiat Grande Panda sub-compact crossover. ""At Stellantis, we are ready for the fight,"" he added.
More Stellantis Stories
The former Yugo plant, which used to build the Fiat 500L minivan, is a key part of Stellantis’ fight with the influx of Chinese-made EVs, which are sometimes cheaper than European-made ones. Production costs are lower at the Serbian Kragujevac factory than in Poland, France and Italy. This, coupled with the country’s recent reinstatement of a mining license to develop Europe’s biggest lithium mine, will help keep the selling price down–as low as $28,000 in the case of the Fiat Grande Panda.
""We are going to demonstrate to them that ... we are hard-working, we are going to demonstrate to them that we have the right technology, we are going to demonstrate to them that we are a very fierce competitor,"" Carlos Tavares said.
That “fierce competitor” attribute can also be interpreted with the help of the old saying, “If you can’t beat them, join them.” That’s because earlier this year, Stellantis, through its joint venture with Leapmotor, started assembling a Chinese-made EV at its factory in Tychy, Poland. The Leapmotor T03 is a city car that costs around $21,000 to $24,000 and comes with a 41.3-kilowatt-hour battery and single electric motor that makes either 94 horsepower (70 kilowatts) or 107 hp (80 kW), depending on the trim. The WLTP-rated range is 174 miles on a full charge.
By comparison, the Fiat Grande Panda, based on the same platform as the Citroen e-C3, features a 113 hp front motor paired with a 44 kWh battery for a claimed range of 195 miles, presumably on the WLTP cycle. A mild-hybrid model will also be available, powered by a 1.2-liter gasoline engine making around 100 hp.",Iulian Dnistran
Here’s Why Rivian’s Partnerships With Ford And Mercedes-Benz Fell Apart,https://insideevs.com/news/727524/rivian-ford-mercedes-benz/,"It had nothing to do with electric motors or batteries. And now with Volkswagen, Rivian reckons it has the winning ticket.",2024-07-23 09:29:48,"Only a couple of years ago, it seemed like global heavyweights Ford and Mercedes-Benz would end up tight with California-based EV startup Rivian. The maker of the all-electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV was just getting started, but many assumed it would've had at least two platform-sharing projects with those two old-school titans.
Ford aimed to use Rivian’s skateboard platform for a Lincoln model and a blue oval-branded EV. At the same time, the partnership with Mercedes-Benz was meant to produce at least two battery-powered vans at an existing factory in Europe. Both deals fell through, however, leaving Rivian to move forward on its own regarding manufacturing. Ford and Mercedes-Benz also went their own ways.
Platform-sharing is harder than it seems
There's often talk of platform-sharing between car companies as a simple solution to filling certain market gaps. But while simple badge-engineering jobs like the Ram ProMaster EV (which is just a rebadged Fiat) are simple enough, making a brand-new car using bits from a different company isn't exactly a walk in the park, as Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe explained during an interview with The Verge.
Now we know why those partnerships ended because the startup’s CEO, RJ Scaringe, spilled the beans during a lengthy interview with The Verge’s Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel for the Decoder podcast.
In short, it had nothing to do with engineering constraints such as trying to fit the body of a Ford or Mercedes-Benz on top of a Rivian chassis–which is no small feat in itself. Instead, it was all about trying to make all the different computers talk to each other, which, as it turned out, was a deal-breaker.
“We looked at vehicle platform sharing with Ford, vehicle platform sharing with Mercedes, both very publicly,” Scaringe said. “What is, in every case, always the challenge is getting the network architectures of Rivian’s platform and those other manufacturers that we’ve talked to to work together,” he added.
The California company’s founder and head honcho said that it’s a challenge to get two very different architectures to run down the same manufacturing line and that the biggest technical boundary was network architecture.
“It’s a challenge in every possible way. It’s a challenge to get the top hat from a traditional company that’s using lots and lots of supplier source ECUs to work with our platform–battery, drivetrain, chassis that has very few ECUs,” Scaringe said about the constraints.
There might have been also factors at play, such as financials, but the CEO didn’t get into these details. Instead, he focused on the electrical architecture struggles. That’s why when the new deal with Volkswagen came along, the main talking point was precisely “the thing that has always been the challenge.”
As a reminder, VW is investing up to $5 billion in the American EV maker to help it overcome the software-related black spots that came after years of delays and mishaps caused by its own software subdivision known as Cariad.
The two companies will not jointly develop EVs in the traditional way. Instead, Rivian will offer its electrical architecture know-how to make it easier for Volkswagen to manufacture EVs that offer a hassle-free user experience.
""We’ll provide the topology of the ECUs, along with the base operating system. That’s both for the infotainment platform and the real-time operating system. There’s a few different operating systems we’ve built, and then everything around over-the-air updates and connectivity,"" Scaringe told The Verge.
On the other hand, Ford seems to be going its own way to the same end goal, developing a skunkworks program out in California staffed by veterans from Tesla, Apple and yes, Rivian. That program will hopefully yield a new, low-cost EV architecture to power a possibly $25,000 electric truck and crossover. As for Mercedes-Benz, it's actually scrapping a next-generation EV platform and seems to be refocusing on internal combustion. Perhaps it will end up wishing it had made a Rivian deal work out.

The Rivian R3X Will Be Next To Arrive After The R2: CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/727482/rivian-r3x-release-scaringe/,"""Then we’ll bring in base R3 after R3X,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a podcast. He also dove deep into Rivian's Volkswagen partnership.",2024-07-22 15:00:51,"You loved the Rivian R3X, right? Of course you did—you have two eyes and a heart, don't you? Rivian's upcoming compact performance crossover, inspired by classic 1980s hot hatchbacks and rally cars, broke the internet when it made its surprise debut earlier this year. Of course, it's unfortunately years away from being released. But now we have more information about where the R3X will stand in Rivian's new pecking order.
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe offered up new details about the R3X in a wide-ranging interview with The Verge's Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel for the latter's Decoder podcast. That podcast is absolutely worth a listen in full, as is reading the transcript if that's more your jam; it's one of the more extensive interviews Scaringe has done as of late on the heels of some developments that have made 2024 Rivian's most promising year to date.
Rivian's journey from startup to stable
Rivian shows tremendous promise as an EV startup and technology company, but like many, it has yet to turn a profit. Getting mainstream models like the R2 and R3 on the road will help, but Rivian plans to make its R1 models profitable by Q4 2024 as well.
Rivian, as you may know, is extremely hot right now. The updated R1S and R1T are on sale now with significant improvements under the skin that could make them profitable electric models by the end of this year. The R1S is now one of the top-selling EVs in the country, and the bestselling premium vehicle EV and the best-selling large SUV (agnostic of what powers it) in California. The startup received considerable hype for its new R2 and R3 models, and that only skyrocketed when it announced a new partnership to develop electric architectures with Volkswagen.
So this Decoder podcast is a must-listen, because Scaringe tells us a lot of things we hadn't heard before. Especially of note is the fact that after the R2 is released in the first half of 2026 (if all goes according to plan, of course) the R3X will come next. No solid date yet, but we do get some new details.
""It’s probably the car that we get the most questions about, and I mean the packaging on it is just exceptional,"" Scaringe said. ""As soon as we possibly can, but we’re not giving a date. So, what we’re doing with this new platform is we’re launching R2 first, allowing some time to get that stable, and then launching R3. I will say this: The first R3 that we’re launching, it’s going to start with R3X, and then we’ll bring in base R3 after R3X.""
He added, ""We all want so bad [to] get the R3X in as soon as possible,"" indicating the people in the company share the excitement over the model. No specs have been released either, but we know it will use the R2's new lower-cost platform; offer a tri-motor configuration standard; and should pack at least 300 miles of range and a Tesla-style NACS plug from the factory. And with three electric motors and more ground clearance than the R3, it should be an incredible performance machine.
Scaringe also elaborated on how the Volkswagen joint venture will work. While some details of that arrangement remain to be seen, but Rivian is getting up to $5 billion to help Volkswagen get past its longtime struggles with software and electrical architectures. (It's doing a similar partnership with XPeng for EVs in China.)
""What we’re providing is that architecture,"" Scaringe said. ""We’ll provide the topology of the ECUs, along with the base operating system. That’s both for the infotainment platform, but also for the real-time operating system. There’s a few different operating systems we’ve built, and then everything around over-the-air updates and connectivity.""
But forget new VWs operating just like Rivians on the software side, and vice-versa. ""What we won’t be providing is our user interface,"" Scaringe said. ""In all the different products this platform will go into, the user interface is actually an abstraction at the top of the stack. A vehicle may have three screens, it may have two screens, it may have 10 screens. That’s relatively simple to change what the UI looks like, but everything underneath will be really heavily commonized using our architecture.""

Tesla Is Losing Ground In The U.S. And Europe: Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/727342/tesla-losing-us-europe/,"In the first half of 2024, Tesla's US sales fell eight percent. It's worse in Europe with a 13-percent drop.",2024-07-21 10:00:16,"It doesn't seem to be a good year for Tesla. After the record results of 2023—when it was the most popular EV manufacturer with the best-selling vehicle in the world—2024 isn't nearly as robust. The latest data collected by JATO Dynamics for the first half of this year shows Tesla losing ground in both the United States and Europe, where sales fell by 8 percent and 13 percent respectively.
While the general public is not entirely enthusiastic about electric cars, overall demand has actually grown in both regions. New, more competitive models introduced on both sides of the Atlantic are attracting more people, despite growing uncertainty about incentives and the future plans of the OEMs that produce these cars.
A sales decline doesn't always mean a loss of market share, but that's not the case with Tesla. In Europe, the brand's volume fell from 185,200 units in the first half of 2023 to 161,300 units for the same period in 2024. However, during that same timeframe, total EV registrations increased by 1.7 percent.
This means Tesla's market share in the European BEV market fell from 19.8 percent to 17.2 percent this year. Tesla was the carmaker with the second-highest decline in BEV market share in Europe through the first six months of 2024, behind only the Volkswagen Group, which fell from 22 percent to 18.7 percent.
Tesla and Volkswagen lost ground to the Geely Group, which was boosted by the solid results of the Volvo EX30, and the BMW Group, which continues to reap success with its latest models. Chinese brands also grew, mainly thanks to BYD.
The situation in the United States is similar. Tesla's sales volume dropped from 324,900 units in the first half of 2023 to 299,200 units this year. Meanwhile, overall BEV sales increased by 7.6 percent in the same period. As a result, Tesla's share dropped from 59.8 percent in 2023 to 51.2 percent in 2024. The company is still a dominant player in its home market, but it's worth noting that numerous competitors posted strong gains amid Tesla's losses. Hyundai increased 34 percent, while Ford saw a 48 percent increase. Rivian was even better at 77 percent, and Kia managed a 110-percent jump.
The first reason for Tesla's decline is obvious. Growth can't continue forever, especially when the range is still limited and quite old. The Model 3 received a refresh in 2023 but it dates to 2017. The Model Y is already five years old, and the Model S goes way back to the early 2010s.
Tesla Model 3
Tesla Model Y
And the competition is coming on strong. In Europe, Tesla is feeling pressure from premium German brands and the Chinese industry. As mentioned previously, Ford, the Koreans, and Rivian are coming on strong in the US. The company's newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, hasn’t really taken off in terms of sales with just 11,300 sold in the US through the first half of 2024.
Finally, the price cuts that worked so well in 2023 aren't so attractive now. As more EVs come to market from other brands, increasing supply and selection effectively reduces demand and prices fall. At this point, Tesla needs more than just big discounts and attractive updates for its cars. It needs fresher products in more segments.

"Trump Hates EVs, But Welcomes China To Build Cars In The U.S.",https://insideevs.com/news/727311/trump-evs-welcomes-china-make-cars-in-us/,The former President expressed a surprise openness to Chinese brands at this week’s Republican National Convention.,2024-07-19 18:41:53,"Former President Donald Trump’s unabashed opposition to electric cars isn’t new. The now-official Republican nominee and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, have waged a war on EVs. “The cars don’t go far enough. They’re very, very expensive. They’re also heavy,” Trump told Bloomberg recently. He’s also said that the auto industry would face a “bloodbath” from Chinese competition if he were not reelected. But at this week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump expressed a surprise openness to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S.
“Right now as we speak, large factories just are being built across the border in Mexico,” Trump said at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. He added, “Those plants are going to be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants.""
EVs are heavily politicized in the U.S.
Electric cars are a hot-button issue in the upcoming presidential elections. The Biden administration has spent hundreds of billions of dollars accelerating EV adoption. Former President Trump wants to ""end the EV mandate,"" when there's none to start with.
Those remarks come as a surprise to countless groups, from American auto industry officials who fear competition from China's advanced EVs all the way to fellow Republican lawmakers who have been intensely tough on the country and its ruling Chinese Communist Party government.
He implied that he would push to amend the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade deal and slap taxes as high as 200% on Mexican-made cars to prevent them from entering the U.S.
That would represent a sea change for the entire auto industry, given how many U.S.-market cars—electric and otherwise—are built in Mexico by General Motors, Ford, Mazda, Nissan, BMW and countless others.
That includes the new Chevy Blazer EV and Equinox EV, made at GM’s Ramoz Arizpe plant. BYD and Tesla both have plans to build plants in Mexico. There’s a real possibility that the Kia EV3, too, could be made there. Trump has a problem with that.
The Biden Administration has already imposed a hefty 100% tariff on Chinese car imports, effectively prohibiting them from selling in the U.S. at potentially predatory prices. But the ones made across the borders are free from tariffs.
BYD Shark - plug-in hybrid pickup (1)
The former President says a lot of things. Many of them are blatant lies. It’s one of the reasons newspapers employ full-time fact-checkers. So take his comments with a grain of salt. But Chinese carmakers would presumably be smiling at Trump’s comments.
The potential implications of that, especially in the context of how Japanese carmakers began conquering the U.S. car market in the 1980s by building local plants, are far too glaring to be ignored.
The first U.S.-made Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans rolled out decades ago and with them, they introduced hyper-efficient production processes that minimized errors on the assembly lines and maximized output. Years later, Japanese cars still reign supreme in the U.S. Toyota has been a top-selling U.S. brand in several categories, and nearly all Honda vehicles sold in America are built here as well.
Hypothetically, Chinese automakers too, would bring substantial expertise in building electric cars on American soil. Afterall, Chinese automakers and battery makers have been able to democratize and commercialize EVs better than any other country. They maintain an iron grip over battery processing and refining plants and some of the world’s largest battery makers are Chinese. Like CATL, for example.
And yet, in the same speech, Trump vowed to end the “electric vehicle mandate” on day one, if he were reelected. While the fact remains that there exists no “mandate,"" he referred to the EPA’s multi-pollutant emissions criteria finalized early this year. The EPA regulations require automakers to sell more plug-in cars to meet emissions targets aimed at preventing billions of tonnes of harmful gasses from entering the atmosphere.
At the same time, automakers are rolling back their deadlines on electrifying their fleets. So when you walk into a showroom years from now, you’ll likely have the option to choose from a gas car, conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid or a fully-electric model.
All said, it’s safe to say that American automakers employ a powerful group of lobbyists. If at all Trump greenlights Chinese automakers, the homegrown brands won’t sit quiet. They’ll likely do everything in their capacity to prevent that from happening. Will they succeed at that? Your guess is as good as mine.

Will Audi Still Go All-Electric By 2026? It's Staying 'Flexible.',https://insideevs.com/news/726706/audi-electric-2026-plan/,"“We have a perfect strategy to be flexible for the next 10 years,"" Audi's chairman told InsideEVs as it readies a new e-tron and gas sedan.",2024-07-16 05:00:00,"Car manufacturers the world over have said many things about their powertrain strategies. Broadly, many insist that the end of pure internal combustion is nigh and, after a quick dalliance with various takes on hybridization, everything will be electric (mostly). Audi’s messaging has been broadly along those lines, saying it will only introduce new combustion-powered cars up until 2026 followed by ""the gradual phasing out of production of vehicles with combustion engines by 2033.""
At least, that was the plan. The landscape is changing. People in power today say one thing about EVs, while in a few months, a new entity at the top can do an about-face. Take the UK and its reverse ferret on the so-called “ICE Ban,” which promised to end sales of un-electrified ICE vehicles from 2030 on but caused such a stir that it had to be punted back five years. In the U.S., the Biden Administration eased its tough standards to get to a zero-emission future more gradually. And other countries may be looking to follow suit or to relax stringent deadlines.
The Volkswagen Group's troubled EV transition
On the heels of its diesel cheating scandal, the Volkswagen Group announced its future would be all-electric. Since then, it's been dogged by countless software delays, uneven EV demand globally and a constantly shuffling deck of executives. Can it still execute this pivot?
Meanwhile, automakers are realizing this future will be harder and more expensive than they envisioned, and that it hinges on things they’re often very bad at at. Then there’s customer demand; if the money isn’t in BEV in the main it doesn’t make sense for a business to doggedly stick to a plan that’ll ultimately close it down. While EV sales hit new records in 2023 in the U.S. and 2024 is looking strong as well, that growth is hardly global, and when it does exist it's often on the backs of aggressive lease and financing deals.
All of this is to say: It's do-able, but easily the most difficult and unpredictable transformation any industry has ever undertaken.
Audi’s plan looked good from 30,000 feet, but with the above worries in mind, as well as reports of both ICE and hybrid engines carrying on in various states, we caught up with a man who could tell us exactly what was going on: The boss.
Speaking at the press preview of the new Audi A5, Q5 and A6 e-tron in Germany, Gernot Döllner, Chairman of the Board at Audi AG, had this to say: “We have a lot of debate, especially in Europe and North America regarding the speed of the transition from combustion engine to battery electric vehicle. We believe that to be able to reach decarbonization targets, electrification is the future.”
So far, so good, but then Döllner revealed the kicker: “We have a perfect strategy to be flexible for the next 10 years.”
“Flexible” is a fun word. It’s up there with your parents saying “maybe” when your childhood self asked them for a treat or toy of some sort. It buys wiggle room, and that may well be needed. After all, Audi is about to launch several new gas-powered models, including the all-important Q5 crossover; that may be before that previously planned 2026 cutoff date, but it's still going to stick around for a while.
Continuing, Döllner made no bones about Audi’s future, and the variety it’ll bring to the brand. “Nobody knows how fast the transition [from ICE to BEV] will be. And with the new models coming, we will have both a very strong renewed ICE and hybrid portfolio and a new battery electric portfolio. So we can proudly say that the Audi brand is flexible.”
Döllner went on to explain how the brand will make sure it has an EV offering across the board by 2027, and that Audi’s ICE lineup updates will be complete by the end of 2026. He continues with what could be read as a caveat though: “These new models will bring Audi to an excellent position, and we are able, as mentioned, to react flexibly to changes in the market…”
Later, during a Q&A, Döllner elaborated on the current plans AND the wiggle room. He stated that there’s an “endpoint [for ICE] defined for Europe, and that’s 2033,” which seems pretty definitive. Audi’s number of ICE cars will steadily reduce as time goes on as it lines itself up for a battery-powered future, but then the F-word appeared again. “We are flexible. We’re now bringing an all-new lineup of ICE cars, and so in two to three years… is a point when we’ll have to take the decision on if we only have this generation we’ve just started, or if we then add on. Which is good, and gives us the flexibility to react.”
It's not like Audi isn't taking the electric fight lying down, of course. It just debuted the Q6 and SQ6 e-tron, arguably its most important products in decades, designed to compete in the ultra-tough midsize EV crossover segment. The e-tron GT and renamed Q8 e-tron just got significant updates, and more new electric models are coming too, like the A6 e-tron sedan and its Avant wagon counterpart. Expect some electric RS models soon as well. But some hard-out date for ICE vehicles? Well, that depends.
Here it’s noted that the European Union is reviewing its regulations on the matters of internal combustion in 2026, which could give Audi’s gas-powered offering a stay of execution for a spell longer. It’s looking like 2026 and 2027 are going to be crucial years for the people at the top of Audi’s decision-making trees.
For now, Döllner’s line seems firm: “We believe that battery electric vehicles will be the right answer for what’s coming, and we already had that strategy.”
That strategy, though, seems to be “flexible.”

VinFast Delays North Carolina EV Plant To 2028 Over 'Economic Headwinds' And Not Any Other Reasons,https://insideevs.com/news/726556/vinfast-north-carolina-delay-2028/,"The Vietnam-based startup automaker, already plagued with notorious reviews and scandals back home, is pushing back its U.S. factory.",2024-07-14 11:00:00,"It was supposed to be ""the crown jewel of VinFast’s global expansion."" Now, the Vietnamese auto startup's $4 billion electric vehicle factory near Raleigh, North Carolina will not open until 2028, despite originally slated to be operating this month. The automaker blames ""economic headwinds"" and uncertainty in ""the global EV landscape,"" but as with most things VinFast, there's more to the story than that.
On Friday evening, VinFast announced that it has ""made the strategic decision to adjust the timeline for the launch of its North Carolina manufacturing facility,"" pushing that target date back a full four years. Construction is currently on hold at the plant, which was said to one day build the three-row VinFast VF9 and five-seat VinFast VF8 electric SUVs.
VinFast is an ambitious but troubled EV startup
Vietnam is new to the world of making cars and VinFast represents its highest ambitions. However, critics say it may have attempted to expand globally too quickly without products that were truly competitive, and the company has been accused of various financial improprieties as well.
""We have adopted a more prudent outlook that is carefully calibrated to near-term headwinds, taking into full consideration the realities of market volatility and potential challenges,"" Madam Thuy Le, Chairwoman of VinFast's Board of Directors, said in a news release. ""Our robust long-term strategy and proven execution capabilities position us well to meet the evolving needs of the dynamic global EV market.""
While it's certainly true that the global EV transition is more complex, costly and difficult than most automakers and governments had anticipated, and demand is proving to be uneven worldwide, VinFast has faced more headaches than mere economic uncertainty. The automaker has faced a slew of negative early reviews, allegations of impropriety in its home country, an investor lawsuit in the U.S. and serious quality issues as it seeks to be a major player in the space.
VinFast emerged almost out of nowhere in recent years as the automotive arm of Vingroup, one of Vietnam's largest privately owned companies and a conglomerate with interests in smartphones, hospitals, hotels, retail and more. Founded in 2017, it originally made gas-powered cars with help from General Motors and BMW before pivoting to EVs. It has since attempted a rapid global expansion and is deploying a lineup of electric cars at a record-setting place.
Key to those ambitions is the U.S. market, which necessitated American production. The North Carolina factory was originally set to be a 995,500-square-foot facility aimed at bringing 7,500 jobs to the region in service of building 150,000 EVs per year. For such an ambitious plan, it was awarded some $1.2 billion in state and county incentives over the next few decades.
However, as the Carolina Journal noted in a report this spring, construction had been paused at the site after VinFast submitted a new plan to Chatham County's government in December indicating the site would be considerably smaller. This change of plans led the county to review the permit request. ""No construction is being done until this permit revision is issued,"" a county official said at the time.
Meanwhile, VinFast's sole offering currently for sale in the U.S., the VF8, has received unprecedentedly scathing reviews for a modern car. Critics dinged its ride quality, user experience, handling and price tag; InsideEVs' first drive test was merely headlined ""Yikes."" The company has since relied mostly on influencer and social media marketing to reach American buyers. Globally, it still claims to have delivered 12,058 vehicles in the second quarter of this year alone and is on target to more than double last year's sales to 80,000.
But that claim comes with some caveats. VinFast has been accused of ""selling"" most of its cars to a taxi service owned by Vingroup. And as InsideEVs reported earlier this year, some critics of the automaker in Vietnam have faced detention from the police, under a law that punishes those who ""infringe upon the interests of the state, organizations, and individuals.”
Still, VinFast continues to debut new models, including the electric $9,000 VF3 city car that first appeared at CES. The company is either beginning sales or starting its expansion into Thailand, the Philippines, Europe and the Middle East. But it's looking more and more like perhaps VinFast should've led with that vehicle and those markets before seeking to take the U.S. by storm.
That's going to be years away now, if it ever happens at all, especially since current U.S. rules prioritize incentives for EVs built in North America. Meanwhile, the taxpayers of North Carolina—who were also promised thousands of new manufacturing jobs—are the ones left in the lurch. As the Carolina Journal notes, the state's Transformative Job Development and Investment Grant ""has had a terrible track record"" with most incentive recipients pulling out of their agreements with the state.

Florida Has A Huge EV Market. It's Paying For Other States' Chargers Instead,https://insideevs.com/news/726295/florida-nevi-grants-ev-charging/,"Gov. Ron DeSantis once aimed to “strengthen” Florida’s EV infrastructure. Now it's denying federal charging funds, and the money is going elsewhere.",2024-07-11 15:00:00,"By the end of 2023, Florida’s roads were home to about 232,000 electric vehicles, making the Sunshine State the second-biggest EV market in the U.S. Chalk it up to low electricity costs, or abundant sunlight for solar energy, or even the huge luxury car market in cities like Miami. No matter the reasons, Florida’s electric car growth has been hailed as “a beacon of progress” by the nonprofit Electrification Coalition.
Not a bad outcome for a technology that’s often embroiled in bitter, partisan politics—especially in a state where the political climate is very different from other EV-heavy places like California and New York.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program
NEVI is a $5 billion program authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It allocates federal money to states for DC fast charging, which they then dole out to private companies who apply to build the chargers. The program has been criticized for how long the chargers have taken to install, but more and more NEVI-funded plugs are starting to appear nationwide.
But politics are coming for EVs in Florida. As the U.S. government aims to make unprecedented investments into charging networks that serve EV drivers, Florida is falling behind—a deliberate decision by state leaders.
Florida has yet to dole out any existing federal money allocated to the state to grow its DC fast-charging network, as multiple outlets have reported in recent weeks, including the Tampa Bay Times and Axios. The state has $198 million over five years earmarked for chargers under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, but not a single dollar has been distributed to private companies in the form of grants to install new EV plugs.
That means companies like ChargePoint, Tesla and even gas stations that wish to install chargers can’t do so with federal funding help in Florida, as they can in other states.
Instead, the Florida Department of Transportation produced a new website that, among other things, rails against “the groupthink culture that is the Biden Agenda”—as well as EVs themselves.
ChargePoint charging infrastructure
“Rather than focusing on ways to increase throughput and highway capacity, [the U.S. Department of Transportation] seeks to force people out of their cars in one way or another whether that be through reducing lanes or issuing regulatory mandates to force electric vehicles on American commuters,” the website reads.”Why would the government be so insistent on getting rid of one of the greatest inventions [sic] like the combustion engine?”
The site, “Roads Are Not For Politics,” includes a laundry list of culture-war issues that state officials claim are driven by the Biden Administration, including “COVID tyranny” and “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).”
But it also includes partisan-flavored criticism of EVs, citing the money Ford has lost building out its manufacturing base and what it calls “low consumer demand” despite a record sales year in 2023.
Florida DOT Website
“While the federal government's obsession with electric vehicles is increasingly becoming an obsession that help's [sic] China, Florida continues its all-hands-on-deck approach to fight back through court challenges and educating Floridians on these mandates, emphasizing the importance of ‘fuel freedom’ and consumer choice,” the site reads.
FDOT announced this new website in a statement filled with invective toward the Biden Administration from Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""Unlike the federal government, under my leadership Florida's Department of Transportation is focused solely on transportation,"" DeSantis said. ""We listen to Floridians and meet their needs. Roads are not for politics.”
But if Florida shuns that federal money, the Sunshine State’s taxpayers are essentially funding EV chargers in other states, like California and New York, said Loren McDonald, the CEO of analytics firm EVAdoption.
A NEVI-funded charger opens in Kingston, New York.
“Florida residents have paid for NEVI via their federal taxes, so if Florida doesn’t use the money to build out charging infrastructure, then DeSantis is in essence cheating his own state’s residents of getting something in return for their tax payments,” McDonald said.
Meanwhile, would-be charging providers who want to serve Florida’s growing EV driver community are getting fed up.
The Charge Ahead Partnership—a coalition of businesses that includes gas station chains like Wawa and Buc-ee's, all eager to expand into the electric “fueling” market—has criticized Florida’s still-closed application process for NEVI funding. And Florida’s moves come at a time when the U.S. government has already been lambasted for the slow rollout of NEVI-funded chargers, the group said. (As InsideEVs has covered before, the DC fast-charger installation process is often hampered by the cumbersome local permitting process, which can vary wildly from community to community.)
Mercedes-Benz Charging Network
But FDOT spokesman Michael Williams defended the site’s claims in an email to InsideEVs and reiterated that the onus of building out charging will be on the private sector in Florida.
“Free enterprise, not federal mandates, are the driving force when any industry experiences growth,” Williams said. “Nothing prohibits the private sector from building out our nation’s charging network. With the total number of EVs on the road today constituting approximately 1% of all vehicles registered across the nation, ‘low consumer demand’ is an accurate statement.”
Besides the fact that the private sector is the one tasked with building out America’s charging networks, McDonald, from EVAdoption, said the statement is a mischaracterization of how our century-old car evolves as new technologies emerge.
“It will take 40+ years to replace most ICE vehicles on the road in the U.S.,” he said. “We are now at 290 million vehicles on the road in the US, and about 4.5 million of those are [EVs] and [plug-in hybrids.] A wide choice of EV models and high-volume production of EV models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have only emerged in the last few years.”
The hostility toward EVs and the NEVI program represents a strange reversal for DeSantis. In 2020, the governor touted an $8.6 million investment to “strengthen Florida’s electric vehicle infrastructure” and “improve Florida’s environment.” The state even drafted a fairly robust EV Infrastructure Master Plan in 2021 that anticipated aggressive growth and a network of chargers to serve it.
“Not only will these charging stations promote reduced emissions and better air quality, they will also improve mobility and safety for the ever-increasing number of Floridians that drive electric cars,” DeSantis said in a 2020 statement—a far cry from the “unscientific climate alarmism” that FDOT is decrying today.
Moreover, around the time former President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of electric vehicles, DeSantis—who was also vying for the GOP nomination before dropping out—vetoed bipartisan legislation that would’ve led the state to buy more of them.
Williams, the FDOT spokesperson, countered by saying “There has been no policy shift [under DeSantis] regarding EVs as FDOT believes all road users should be free to drive what they want, where they want, when they want. FDOT’s objection is to the Biden Administration’s desire to implement a California-style mandate that will ultimately force consumers to purchase EVs.”
The FDOT website still has a NEVI-related page describing the grant program, but it merely says ""Please monitor site for any updates."" So far, none have come.
Kia EV6 at an Electrify America fast charging station
Meanwhile, though it's taken a frustrating amount of time, NEVI-funded chargers are starting to open across the country. The first opened in Ohio last year, followed by 11 others in seven states. McDonald said that this week alone, Maryland released its first round of NEVI awards, which should eventually yield 23 charging sites in 15 counties across the state.
He said that Florida is the one playing politics here, including in ways that could deter EV owners from road-tripping to one of America’s top tourism destinations.
“It is also interesting that the responses you received don’t even mention charging infrastructure or NEVI, but rather just repeat DeSantis talking points about Biden mandates,” McDonald said. “Who is being political here? DeSantis is putting his personal politics and dislike of Biden ahead of what is actually in the best interest of the residents of the state of Florida.”
McDonald added, “This is just crazy.”

Are Half Of EV Owners Really 'Switching Back' To Gas? It's Complicated.,https://insideevs.com/news/726008/mckinsey-study-half-ev-buyers/,"A new McKinsey study is being used as ammo against EVs. In reality, the next wave of EV buyers need more help than they're getting.",2024-07-10 12:00:00,"You probably saw the headlines. According to a new survey, 46% of electric vehicle owners in America now say they intend to ""switch back"" to internal combustion-powered cars. This particular statistic from McKinsey & Company's newest Mobility Consumer Pulse survey has been cited far and wide as an example of how troubled the EV transition really is.
The results go against conventional wisdom in the automotive world: That once people go electric, they almost never go back. Is that sentiment really starting to change right as the auto industry aims to take EVs more mainstream?
Mainstream headaches for EVs
The next great growth area for EVs is said to be a more mainstream crowd: lower- and middle-income buyers, people who want practical everyday cars and total newcomers to the electric world. But they are experiencing a much tougher situation than comparatively more forgiving early Tesla owners faced, especially when it comes to range and public charging.
The reality is more complicated and nuanced than that, one of the study's authors told InsideEVs. And what the data proves, this author says, is that automakers, dealers and charging companies have a lot more work to do if they want to keep any sort of electric momentum going.
""It's important not to just get stuck on that headline,"" said Philipp Kampshoff, who leads McKinsey's Center for Future Mobility in the Americas. However, ""when I look at the data, I think it's a bit of a clear warning signal that we need to fix these issues quickly,"" he said.
The McKinsey study included a number of fascinating data points on what people think about autonomous driving functionalities, or whether they'd consider buying cars from China, or what they want from connected software features.
McKinsey Study Slide 1
But a question about whether EV owners were ""very likely"" to switch back to ICE vehicles—meaning, replacing them entirely and not just adding a second or third gas or hybrid car to the fleet, Kampshoff said—has gotten the largest amount of wider attention. ""We've gotten tons of inbound requests to talk about this one,"" he said.
Globally, around 29% of the survey respondents said they probably would not go electric next time.
All of those owners cited familiar pain points with modern EVs: problems finding working public chargers, an inability to charge at home for whatever reason and general range anxiety.
McKinsey Study Slide 2
Kampshoff said that the questionnaire went to about 36,000 people in 15 countries and that it was conducted in the last few months—meaning that it included a lot of new EV owners following a record year of global sales.
In the U.S., he said, that included about 4,000 respondents. In other words, only 1,840 people actually said they're likely to give up electric driving next time. That's a relative drop in the bucket, considering that about 1.4 million new EVs were registered in the U.S. in 2023 alone and many of those owners could be very happy with their purchases.
But the anti-EV sentiment among some drivers speaks to who is buying EVs now, and what new converts expect from the experience. And fixing those issues will be crucial to wider EV adoption, Kampshoff said.
Those new owners surveyed are, increasingly, moving away from the profile that long-defined the EV life: upper-income or wealthy, probably a single-family homeowner and probably buying a Tesla. Instead, they're buying from other brands at more affordable prices, often enticed by aggressive leasing and financing deals for EVs.
But that also means that they're living without Tesla's robust and reliable fast-charging network (until it's open to all drivers, anyway); may live in apartments without easy access to charging; and are less willing to put up with the kinds of EV-related headaches that many early adopters took in stride. And in recent years, going electric could mean losing a huge amount of your car's resale value thanks to last year's spate of price cuts, which Kampshoff said is another major turn-off for some current owners.
Interestingly, he said, many of those survey respondents in the U.S. who indicated they might reject EVs next time were on the younger side—around 36 years old. And many also have young families. They're the ones who have felt the pain of America's subpar charging network more than others, he said.
""Imagine having little children in the car and having to do a detour for half an hour to find a fast charger, and it's not working,"" Kampshoff said. ""The frustration gets exacerbated.""
McKinsey Study Slide 3
Indeed, that's often an all-too-common situation for EV drivers, whether they have kids or not. Plus, charging at home remains difficult if you rent or live in an apartment complex. And while America's DC fast charging infrastructure has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, it still struggles with both abundance and reliability.
""We're moving more and more into a generation of buyers that rely much on public charging infrastructure,"" Kampshoff said. ""They probably use their car very similar to the way they've used a car before, just by going to public infrastructure. Before, you went to a gas station, and now you've got to use a charger. But now they're realizing, that's not so easy.""
Kampshoff said that this challenge is also an issue of education for buyers who are new to a technology that can be very different from gas-powered cars. Are they being told where and how to charge, or how to get a home charger if that's an option, or what a kilowatt-hour is and what it means for them?
But it's unclear who's going to step up and improve that situation. After all, many—but certainly not all—car dealers have been historically reluctant to sell EVs, since doing so comes with expensive charging investments and potentially losing out on repair revenue. And automakers have long relied on their ""dealer partners"" to teach customers about what these vehicles actually do. Plus, neither of those parties may be in a great rush to sell more EVs as they struggle to make and sell them profitably, he said.
Blazer EV and Ioniq 5 Charging
""Not necessarily everybody is equally incentivized to sell them,"" he said. A dealer may say, ""If you are unhappy with the infrastructure or residual values, why don't you switch back to an ICE car for now and then you can go back to your EV later?"" he said. ""Why not push those for a little longer?""
Still, Kampshoff said he was more optimistic about EVs after this study than you may think. ""There's a lot of positive here,"" he said.
He said that since only 29% of global survey respondents indicated they would switch back to an ICE-powered vehicle instead of their EV, ""You can make the statement that 71% said that they won’t switch back. That’s pretty high loyalty to EVs.""
But more needs to be done by all parties involved to keep a new generation of buyers from fleeing electric cars next time.
""The reasons people are unsatisfied are not related to the product,"" he said. ""They’re switching back because of charging and resale values. Both of those are fixable.""

Tesla Is Losing Its Grip On The EV Market. Can Rivals Step Up?,https://insideevs.com/news/726001/tesla-losing-grip-can-rivals-step-up/,Tesla’s declining market share is opening up room for rivals to shine. But it’s still an uphill battle.,2024-07-09 15:30:44,"Electric vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2024 were a simulacrum of broader industry trends. In many ways, the sales were an extension of what we saw in Q1: Legacy automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Hyundai witnessed double-digit percentage growth compared to last year, whereas Tesla continued to slip.
As Elon Musk’s company pivots to artificial intelligence and robotaxis, its passenger vehicle business seems to have taken a backseat. Sure, Cybertruck production is ramping up and there’s now a refreshed Model 3, which InsideEVs can confirm is excellent. But the rest of the lineup needs upgrades. The facelifted Model Y isn’t due until next year and the Model X and Model S, in their current forms, are way past their expiration dates.
The EV market is complex.
It's certainly way more complex than previously thought. Sales are rising, but not at the levels brands expected. The early adopter phase is long over. To appeal to the new wave of buyers, many of them middle income households, all EV-related anxieties need to vanish. That means hitting the sweet spot with driving range, charging infrastructure and ownership costs.
Can Tesla’s rivals now play a bigger role in the broader adoption of EVs and fill the sales void that’s being left behind?
Analysts certainly think so, but it won’t be easy. According to them, Tesla could continue to lose its EV market share by a few percentage points each year for the rest of this decade. So Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and others have a golden opportunity to step up. But some major roadblocks include high interest rates, a string of EV-ownership-related anxieties, the threat of a new U.S. president reversing pro-EV policies and the challenge of making new affordable models appealing.
How they navigate these obstacles will ultimately decide who comes out on top.
Edmunds’ sales data (excluding direct-to-consumer sales from Tesla, Rivian, etc.) suggests that less than half of current EV owners are repurchasing EVs.
“If you have an EV and you trade it into a dealership, you're still under 50% of the time buying another EV,” said Ivan Drury, the director of insights at Edmunds. About 30% of those customers are going back to gas cars whereas others are opting for hybrids and plug-in hybrids. “Everybody is hurting because of interest rates, range anxiety, charging anxiety, all those anxieties,” Drury said.
EV range has increased over the past few years as battery manufacturers continuously improve the energy density. The charging infrastructure is growing, but probably not at the rate it needs to. Moreover, Tesla’s firing of its Supercharging team was a major blow to the overall charging landscape in the U.S. At the same time, the pool of potential new EV buyers has also increased. That means the limited number of models with over 300 miles of EPA range isn’t enough to drive mass adoption.
“Four or five years ago people were buying EVs as additional cars, not replacement cars,” Drury said. Now buyers are considering EVs as their only cars. But they’re hesitant due to concerns like high costs and inadequate charging infrastructure.
“The dynamics have changed to where now we're talking about mainstream buyers with mainstream concerns,"" he said. ""That is a very different segment of the population than the early adopter.”
Despite the decline in new Tesla sales, the market is headed in the correct direction because there are clear signs of others stepping up.
General Motors increased its EV sales by 40% year-over-year thanks to models like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV. Ford’s EV sales were up 61% thanks to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and many others witnessed record EV sales in the U.S. this quarter.
“The market has taken a drastic turn. You're seeing that the other options are now viable. Tesla has legitimate competition. We're seeing that people are willing to switch brands,” Drury said.
Part of what drives sales are attractive lease deals, cashback offers and many discounts. Several EVs have leases starting under $300 per month, like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, Nissan Ariya, Tesla Model 3, Toyota bZ4x and more. Many of them have 0% APR. “We have about 69% of all EVs from dealerships that are leased, and that makes it very enticing,” Drury said. Customers may be saying, “If you make it cheap enough, I might just roll the dice and do it,"" he said.
“We are forecasting roughly 25,000 fewer Tesla units will be delivered [in 2024] versus 2023,” said Loren McDonald, the CEO of analytics firm EVAdoption.
EVAdoption forecasts U.S. BEV sales to reach 1.21 million units in 2024 versus 1.13 million in 2023, a 7% increase. In the best-case scenario, where sales of models like the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox EV take off and Tesla sales rebound, EVAdoption projects a year-over-year increase of 12-15%.
By the end of the year, GM will offer 10 EVs in its portfolio, the most by any automaker in the U.S. And so far this year, its EVs are already crushing it. All new Ultium-based EVs witnessed double-digit percentage growth in the first two quarters of this year. Even the hulking Hummer EV, starting at a shade under $100,000, is finding buyers.
In addition, automakers are racing to launch the next generation of affordable EVs, many of which are expected to be available in 2026.
Tesla is working on “several affordable models” that Musk said would use a mix of existing platforms and new tech. Ford is developing its new “skunkworks” EVs that include a $25,000 pickup truck, SUV and an EV for rideshare purposes. GM is developing the next-gen Bolt EV. The adorable Kia EV3 is also confirmed for the U.S. and is expected to arrive after 2025.
“These new affordable ones will have to sell themselves on merit. It can't just be cheap because if all I want is cheap, I can get a cheap used EV right now,” Drury said. That’s certainly true because the average transaction price of a used EV has plummeted in recent months.
Even though EV start-ups like Tesla and Rivian rely on direct-to-consumer sales, most of the U.S. car-buying population still relies on dealerships.
People seem to enjoy walking into a showroom, feeling the touch and smell of a new car, exploring the features and speaking to sales staff in person. That means dealerships now have a chance to truly embrace EVs and contribute to the decarbonization that a rapidly warming planet desperately needs.
“People buy the same car over and over again, they go to the same dealerships over and over again—they just want trust,” Drury said.
They love loyal customers because they will sing the praises of the product, the dealership and the brand, according to Drury. Brands like Toyota and Honda have built their entire reputation on loyalty and reliability. “If you're hesitant to go outside of your dealer network, now that's not a problem because the brand you like might actually have an EV,"" he said.
Even if Tesla sales plummet, the conditions are increasingly ripe for others to step up and shine. Legacy automakers already have the reputation and sales framework in place. Millions of existing loyal customers could be open to switching to EVs if their anxieties vanish. To emerge as worthy rivals to Tesla, they need to start offering reliable and cheap models that owners can feel confident about.
Barring something that’s beyond the realm of predictability, like a pandemic or some global downturn, or a disastrous policy change after the presidential elections, it’s pretty clear that EVs are here to stay.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E Just Got Way More Affordable,https://insideevs.com/news/725984/ford-mach-e-july-lease/,"Zero percent financing? In this economy? It's real, and Ford is doing it. A new 24-month lease is available on the Mustang Mach-E too.",2024-07-09 12:00:26,"I don't know if you've noticed this, but it's not cheap to get into a new car these days. Though the average new car price has been going ""down"" over the past few months, it was still around $45,000 in June—and still way up from pre-pandemic times. Plus, sky-high interest rates mean you'll be paying a lot more than you would have a few years ago.
But lately, we've been seeing that one of the cheapest ways to get a new car is to go electric. Many automakers are offering aggressive leasing and financing deals on their EVs amid uneven global demand, in hopes that they can keep last year's momentum going as they build out their long-term electric plans.
Cheap EV Lease deals
We've seen aggressive lease deals on EVs from Chevrolet, Cadillac, Ford, Kia, Hyundai, Lucid, Toyota and more. If you're shopping for a new car, going electric could save you a lot of money right now.
You can add Ford to that list today. The automaker announced that it's adding a new 24-month lease deal to all Mustang Mach-E models, including 2024 and leftover 2023 ones—I'll get to that in a moment—with more lease cash, plus 0% financing if you'd rather go the buying route. That would include the new Mustang Mach-E Rally, which recently got high marks in our testing.
Considering that the average interest rate for a car loan is between 6% and 7% if you have amazing credit, that's quite a compelling deal.
Ford officials also said that 0% financing deals are also available nationwide right now for 72 months and 60 months on 2023 and 2024 F-150 Lightning models, respectively.
But a 24-month lease deal, which includes an additional $7,500 Red Carpet Lease Cash, is especially interesting. Several automakers have extended those two-year lease deals to their EV options; since this technology is evolving so quickly, some customers fear their cars could be ""obsolete"" in a few years and may want to upgrade sooner.
However, now that the Ford EVs can use an adapter to access the Tesla Supercharger network, they've got an edge that competitors don't. Besides getting positive reviews, the Mach-E's sales were up almost 60% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period last year. Ford is now the second best-selling EV manufacturer in the U.S. behind Tesla.
Still, Ford's EV sales have been up and down, and the automaker has since adjusted production to align with customer demand; that does mean some new 2023 models are still for sale nationwide. In this case, if you're willing to go with an ""older"" car, you may be able to score an even better deal. If financed, those Mach-Es can be had with an additional $2,000 off as well.

The problem is that Tesla itself states on its website that the feature doesn’t actually turn any car that has it into an autonomous vehicle and requires the driver to be prepared to take over driving at any time. That makes it a Level 2-capable system on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Levels of Driving Automation chart, despite the repeated promises made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that FSD will one day power an entire fleet of robotaxis. That still hasn’t happened yet and it doesn’t sit well with competitors like Mercedes-Benz which already sells a Level 3-capable ADAS feature.
Where's my self-driving car?
Science fiction has been telling kids that they'll buy self-driving and flying cars by the time they become adults for hundreds of years. But ... checks calendar ... that still hasn't happened yet, although there are systems out there that can take over driving in certain situations. Robotaxi startups like Waymo are also advancing the game, but we're still way off the predictions of yesteryear's authors.
“[Rolling out hands-free driving capabilities] should be a step-by-step approach,” said Jochen Haab, Mercedes-Benz’s head of autonomous driving technology for Drive.com.au.” Do it slowly, but do it the right way. Build trust, build confidence,” Haab added.

Hinting at what is arguably the biggest promoter of self-driving tech in the industry, Tesla, which has been involved in several high-profile cases where people have been killed or injured while allegedly driving with the ADAS features enabled, Mercedes-Benz’s rep said such a stance is dangerous for the industry as a whole.
“We're concerned about others, let's say, promising too much,” Haab said. “That's not the way we approach things. The problem is, if things are overpromised or underperform, even if it's very seldom, the entire trust in autonomous driving itself loses confidence. And that's a bad thing.”
Mercedes-Benz was the first automaker in the world to get permission to sell a Level 3-capable system for use on public roads. The Drive Pilot feature can be used in Germany and the American states of California and Nevada, where it supports a maximum speed of 40 miles per hour due to regulatory limitations. BMW also has a Level 3 driving assistant on sale in Germany called Personal Pilot L3.

Referring to Mercedes-Benz’s L3 Drive Pilot, Tesla’s head of vehicle development, Lars Moravy, went on record last year saying that “it’s not really useful” and that Tesla’s system “is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions.”
Currently, Tesla offers two tiers of its ADAS features. Autopilot comes standard on all new EVs sold by the American company and includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer. Next is the $8,000 so-called Full-Self Driving Capability, which includes Navigate on Autopilot, automatic lane changes, automatic parking, summon and smart summon, automatic steering on city streets and traffic and stop sign control. Previously, there was a middle-tier option called Enhanced Autopilot but it was removed recently from the automaker’s options list.",Iulian Dnistran
Nissan Sales Were Down In Q2 2024. But The Ariya Was Up 123%,https://insideevs.com/news/725439/nissan-ariya-sales-q2-2024/,"The Ariya isn't a major player in the EV market, but it still outsold the aging Murano.",2024-07-03 13:00:27,"You may not think about the Nissan Ariya all that much, but maybe you should start. Clearly, buyers are starting to consider it more.
Nissan is still in the middle of an attempted turnaround after struggling for years with an aging lineup of cars and the downstream effects of a huge corporate scandal. So it's not entirely surprising that Nissan's sales were down 3.1% overall in the second quarter of 2024, but one of its brightest spots was the growth of the electric Ariya.
Nissan's uneven EV strategy
Nissan was an early EV pioneer with the Leaf, but it's been accused by critics and even former company insiders of losing that lead. Like the rest of the Japanese auto industry, it's now playing catch-up on the electric front. But the company is pushing hard to launch new hybrid and electric models.
Nissan's U.S. arm announced yesterday that sales of the Ariya were up a whole 123% in Q2 compared to the same period last year. Granted, that only equaled 5,203 Ariyas sold—meaning the model trails behind the Volkswagen ID.4 and achieved less than half as many sales as the Hyundai Ioniq 5—but it is an improvement from last year's numbers.
Interestingly, the Ariya actually outsold the gas-powered Murano crossover, which was down a whopping 49.5% in sales over Q2 of 2023. This is largely speculation on my part, but it's possible that Nissan crossover buyers looked at the Murano and migrated to the Ariya instead on the back of whatever lease deals or discounts they could find. Those haven't been as aggressive as, say, Hyundai or Toyota, but they do exist.
(The Ariya may also be helped along by the fact that the current Murano model is now 10 years old and absolutely looks it inside; it's due to be replaced by an all-new 2025 model soon enough.)
The Ariya may be worth a second look if you're EV-shopping. It features up to 304 miles of range, a variety of trim levels with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, handsome styling and a user experience that's more beginner-friendly than many other electric options. Its max fast-charging speed of 130 kW is hardly the best out there, but considering how many DC fast chargers max out around 150 kW, it may be just fine for now.
Meanwhile, the Nissan Leaf soldiers on in 2024, though it's set to be discontinued soon and suffers from a fast-charging format that's effectively obsolete. It remains perhaps the cheapest new EV on sale right now, but considering the new glut of used options, you have better choices for your money. Despite that, Leaf sales were up slightly in Q2, with 1,925 units sold. That's a rise from 1,880 in the same period last year. But if you want a modern EV from Nissan, the Ariya's the one to get.

Nissan Techs Are Making House Calls to Teach Owners How to Use Their Cars,https://www.motor1.com/news/724924/nissan-second-delivery-program/,Does this mean there's too much tech in vehicles?,2024-12-25 07:29:06,"In case you haven't noticed, modern vehicles are packed with features and technology. Even the Nissan Versa—the cheapest new car in the United States—has a 7-inch touchscreen with voice controls and buttons all over the steering wheel. Step up to something like the Ariya and there's even more to suss out. The basics are usually straightforward, but figuring out all the tech can be intimidating. Nissan wants to change that.
The automaker is launching a new program called Second Delivery. It's essentially a no-cost follow-up visit for people who buy a new Nissan, designed to help them learn just what their car can do. A Nissan ""tech expect"" will coordinate a time and place to meet the owner, generally two weeks after the first delivery. That can be at the owner's home, work, a lunch stop at the local Starbucks, or the dealership where it all began. The expert will take the owner through all the vehicle's systems, step-by-step.
Such things are generally done during the normal delivery process, but the idea here is to give owners some time to acclimate to their new car before diving deeper. Details can also be missed during the big day, as owners are often excited to get on the road with their spanking-new ride. Listening to a salesperson prattle on about automatic headlight functions or adjusting climate settings through your phone may not stick the first time around.
""Now more than ever, customers expect a personalized experience that matches their wants and needs,"" said Dan Mohnke, Nissan VP of eCommerce and customer experience. ""These types of experiences are extremely important for us to offer for our Ariya customers, who are largely new to the Nissan brand and interested in using all of the latest technology.""
For now, Second Delivery is only offered on the Ariya, presumably because it's Nissan's most technologically demanding vehicle. The service ""is expected to expand"" later in 2024 to the Rogue and Leaf.

Study: Nearly Half of EV Owners in America Want to Switch Back to Gas,https://www.motor1.com/news/724788/half-ev-owners-american-switch-gas/,Inadequate charging infrastructure is keeping people from buying EVs.,2024-12-25 07:29:06,"A few years ago, automakers started to roll out elaborate plans to convert their lineups to battery-electric vehicles. Some even set deadlines for ending gas-powered car production. But many are now reevaluating the future. Sales are slowing for some and not others, consumer interest is waning, and now nearly half of EV owners in America might switch back to gas. What is going on?
McKinsey & Co.'s 2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse study reveals that 46 percent of EV owners in the United States, well above the worldwide average of 29 percent, want to switch to gasoline cars because of the inadequate charging infrastructure. Thirty-five percent of global respondents said the public network isn't good enough yet. Thirty-four percent said EV ownership costs remain too high, while 32 percent said EVs impacted their driving patterns too much on long trips.
The US charging network is growing, which could eliminate these hurdles for owners. As of May, the US had 183,000 public EV chargers, but there still aren't enough. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 allocated $5 billion in grants toward building fast chargers, but the rollout is taking forever due to a myriad of local, state, and federal regulations and consumer needs.
Other reasons owners gave as to why they might switch back include the inability to charge at home (24 percent), the stress of worrying about charging (21 percent), and charging mobility requirements (16 percent). Only 13 percent said they did not enjoy the driving experience. Some people just enjoy driving a combustion car, like 18 percent of US respondents and 28 percent in Germany.
The study also reveals why automakers seem so disjointed from one another in their EV efforts. Growth and the desire to switch back aren't equal worldwide, and some markets are converting faster than others, putting automakers in a difficult position of attempting to cater to wildly varying needs across the globe.
Shockingly, Americans aren't the most eager to switch back to gas. In Australia, a country known for its vast interior, 49 percent of EV owners are considering returning to the pump. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Japan, where only 13 percent of owners might return to a combustion-powered vehicle. Other countries below the worldwide average include Italy (15 percent), France (18 percent), Germany (24 percent), and China (28 percent). Brazil joins the US and Australia above the average at 38 percent.

"Ford CEO Hits Back At Electric Vehicle 'Politics,' Disinformation",https://insideevs.com/news/724961/ford-ceo-farley-ev-note/,"Ford CEO Jim Farley, a ""lifelong petrolhead,"" has a lot to say about EV skepticism—and ceding American leadership to China or Europe.",2024-06-28 18:33:12,"If you're an auto industry executive in 2024, there are three ways to do your job: actively fight against any sort of global electrified transition, bury your head in the sand and aim to retire fast enough for it to be someone else's problem, or actively face these challenges head-on. I give credit to Ford CEO Jim Farley for taking the third path.
Ford hasn't always gotten the EV transformation right under Farley's watch. It's had many of the same stumbles as any other established automaker or even startup out there. Software presents endless headaches, production costs are high, the dealer networks often don't want to play ball, and economic and political trends mean that widespread EV adoption will likely take longer than anyone anticipated.
EVs get political
The Biden Administration initially set aggressive targets for the U.S. new car market to go 50% by 2030. But that's proving more difficult than expected. The backlash to EV investments exists sharply along partisan lines, and if President Trump is reelected in November, many fear that America will cede technological leadership to China.
Still, Ford under Farley—who took the top job at the automaker in 2020—has been repeatedly willing to think outside the box when it comes to EVs. He got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to open up the North American Charging Standard plug to the rest of the industry, hired tech-savvy executives who know what they're doing, established a ""skunkworks"" team to build an affordable EV platform that can take on competitors from China and built out Ford's EV operation as a separate business line.
That's a lot. Especially for a 121-year-old company that is, by the accounts of many inside it who I've spoken to, a tough ship to turn around. But Farley does seem to get where this is all going, and he recognizes that Ford and other so-called ""legacy"" automakers will be made irrelevant and extinct if they don't adapt.
Ford CEO Jim Farley
And Farley seems to get that Ford is a different animal than Tesla or Lucid or Rivian, with a much larger and more traditional customer base to convince to go electric over time. I think that's one reason he penned this article on LinkedIn today touting the benefits of EVs. The article, ""Confessions From a Lifelong Petrol Head—I Love Electric Vehicles And It Has Nothing To Do With Politics,"" is worth a read in full.
""As a lifelong petrolhead, I was [as] surprised as anyone when I fell in love with electric vehicles,"" Farley wrote. ""It wasn’t government policies or political beliefs that sparked this late-career romance with electric vehicles. It’s because I drive one: my Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum... Every morning, mine is topped up with 300 miles of range. No gas stations, ever.""
The article was published ahead of Farley's appearance Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. In it, the CEO hits back at many of the criticisms levied at Ford as of late: that EVs are an enormous cash drain, they're inferior replacements for gas-powered vehicles and that people are being ""forced"" into them by the government.
""As the CEO of a major automaker, I feel compelled to tell customers the truth about electric vehicles amid all the disinformation and misunderstandings,"" Farley wrote. ""It’s true that we are losing money on electric vehicles in the first innings of this transition, largely due to the upfront investment costs. But that too is changing. After all, what major technological leap forward wasn’t challenging and costly at the early stages?""
Farley added, ""The tipping point we’re working toward will come not from regulators who push us or from politicians who try to hold us back. It will come from consumers.""
That last part, and the timing of this note, are key here. The note makes no mention of any specific politicians, but it was released the morning after the CNN Presidential Debate between President Joe Biden and his rival, former President Donald Trump. My guess is Ford anticipated EVs would become a point of contention between the two candidates, as has happened many times before—specifically the Biden Administration's investments into charging infrastructure and advocacy of EV tax credits. (EVs actually didn't come up much during the debate; let's just say things went in a much weirder direction.)
But as Farley notes here, EVs have become highly political in America, despite merely being another form of technology. If Trump is reelected in November, there's a strong chance that the EV tax credit program could disappear, and that Biden's tougher new fuel economy rules could be rolled back. That may slow the industry's electric push. But as Farley implies here, it could merely mean that America will end up even further behind on the mobility technology of tomorrow than it already is now. After all, the nascent Chinese auto industry received some $230 billion in national subsidies over 15 years, and now Western and other Asian automakers are scrambling to catch up.
""We are in a global race to compete in a future where electric propulsion will undoubtedly be a giant force in transportation,"" Farley wrote. ""America cannot cede innovation leadership to China, Europe, or any other region. Ford has survived and thrived for 121 years because we have never been shy about seizing the moment to innovate and face the future. Now, we are investing billions in plants, tech centers, and our workforce to create the must-have cars, SUVs, and trucks of tomorrow.""
Farley closes his note by saying that Ford is committed to offering a range of powertrain choices for customers, including hybrids and internal combustion vehicles. But as a consummate car guy—he races Mustangs in whatever free time he has—he encourages people to give EVs a try too.
""You are better off trying one for yourself and making your own decision,"" he wrote. ""What’s more American than that? Who knows, you might just surprise yourself.""

Mercedes Is Spending Big Money On Gas Engines Again,https://www.motor1.com/news/724830/mercedes-spending-big-money-gas-engines/,"""A lot more"" is being invested in the S-Class compared to a usual facelift.",2024-12-25 07:29:08,"After conceding that its electrification goals have been overly ambitious, Mercedes is now pouring an obscene amount of money into combustion engines. In an interview with German publication Wirtschaftswoche, CEO Ola Källenius said ICE technology ""will last well into the 2030s."" To make sure gas engines will meet increasingly stringent regulations, massive investments are necessary.
Just this year, the three-pointed star is spending €14 billion (about $15 billion at current exchange rates) on its passenger car division alone. The funds are reserved for ""high-tech combustion technology” but also electrification and digitalization. Although the Swedish-German business executive didn’t specify how much Mercedes is spending on ICE, he admitted it's ""more money than previously planned.""
Källenius brought up the S-Class and the flagship's mid-cycle update scheduled for 2026: ""We have invested a lot more in the model update of the new combustion engine S-Class than we normally spend on a facelift."" The goal for Mercedes is to have its conventional powertrains at ""the very highest technological level."" Without spending big money on gasoline and diesel engines, the luxury brand ""would suddenly stall our combustion engine business in 2027 or 2028.""
He was referring to Euro 7 and China 7 regulations and how the engines must be updated to run cleaner to meet stricter emissions rules. The goal is for Mercedes to tweak all ""relevant combustion engines and transmission combinations"" to avoid having to pay massive fines. Källenius mentioned future engines will be electrified to some extent, so expect even more hybrids in the lineup.
Mercedes knows it must adapt now that the transition to EVs isn’t going as planned. Three years ago, it said plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars would represent about 50 percent of annual sales by 2025. However, that’s highly unlikely to happen. At one point, the company even said it would go fully electric by 2030 in some countries “where market conditions allow.”
After being hit in the face by reality, Mercedes has no other way but to readjust its goals. It now wants hybrids and electric cars to account for half of deliveries by the end of the decade. The ultimate objective to become carbon neutral by 2040 hasn't changed, according to Källenius.
He refuted rumors about the company canceling the development of a platform for the next-generation EQS: ""The project is running at high speed."" In addition, it's not scrapping plans for the promised eight gigafactories to build batteries to support its electric ambitions. However, the facilities will be ready ""a little later"" than originally planned.
Since we mentioned the EQS, there was an interesting report earlier this year about how Mercedes was testing its stately electric car with a range-extending combustion engine. The big EV was allegedly fitted with a tiny two-cylinder, 1.0-liter turbocharged engine mounted at the front. However, trials were supposedly stopped.
Mercedes does have a deal with Geely to jointly work on hybrid engines that will go into Volvo models as well. The Chinese automotive giant has expertise in range-extenders, including a separate deal with Renault. The newly formed Horse division specializes in combustion engines, including those developed as range extenders.

How Volkswagen's Endless Software Headaches Led It To Rivian,https://insideevs.com/news/724619/rivian-volkswagen-explained-cm/,"Plus, GM's Cruise gets a new CEO, and we look at the EV market's ""ebbs and flows"" as every company struggles to figure out the future.",2024-06-26 09:49:48,"""CARIAD"" has six letters, but in the auto industry, it's become kind of a four-letter word.
The Volkswagen Group's in-house software division has dealt with countless delays, layoffs, reorganizations and other setbacks since its founding in 2020. Its very name has become a kind of shorthand for the entire industry's difficulties with, well, making anything that doesn't revolve around an engine and a transmission. We can't say CARIAD is throwing in the towel, but its challenges do explain why it's calling in backup from nascent EV startup Rivian.
On this midweek edition of our Critical Materials morning news roundup, we're looking back at how VW ended up needing help from Rivian, and what Rivian gets in return. Plus, General Motors' equally troubled robotaxi division Cruise gets a new CEO, and why you should get ready for the Era of Uncertainty.
Rivian Zonal Architecture
I think that yesterday's announcement of a software joint venture between Volkswagen and Rivian—which also includes the former investing up to $5 billion into the latter—requires a bit of a history lesson. And it may go back as far as Dieselgate, when the Volkswagen Group faced an earth-shattering scandal that led it to commit to one day going all-electric.
To do that, the VW Group needed, for lack of a better term, a Tesla-like approach to software and digital technology. Historically for the entire auto industry, ""software"" means things like engine management, or driver-facing bits like infotainment and navigation, or numerous components made by different suppliers with different software standards who often didn't talk to one another. It was piecemeal and old-school, compared to the smartphones and tablets that have become an integral part of our lives over the past two decades.
That doesn't work in a world where cars will be defined by over-the-air software updates and downloadable, paid features that can mean new revenue sources. Or EV battery management. Or DC fast charger integration. Or advanced automated driving assistance and, one day, fully autonomous cars.
You get the idea. It's a different world now. The cars of the future will be more like computers on wheels than anything else, so now Volkswagen and the rest need to get great at making computers. The alternative is they get turned into car body manufacturers for tech companies, or worse, outright slaughtered by new players who are better at this; China's industry in particular is way ahead on this front.
To be fair, pretty much every ""legacy"" automaker has struggled with pivoting their 100-year-old businesses to do this stuff well. (And companies like Fisker show the startups aren't automatically better, either.) But VW's CARIAD division has had some particularly high-profile setbacks. I wrote about this in-depth for The Verge at the end of 2022, and it feels like things are only incrementally better since I did.
Issues with software have led to negative reviews of early examples of cars like the Volkswagen ID.4; delays of crucial VW Group products, such as the new Porsche Macan EV and Audi Q6 E-Tron; entire platforms, like the one that was supposed to underpin the flagship ""Project Trinity""; and leaning on outside partners like Mobileye for automated driving rather than doing everything in-house. Besides CARIAD's layoffs and reorganizations, these software messes are also part of why VW CEO Herbert Diess was shown the door in 2022.
So, yes. It's been bad. And as the Volkswagen Group loses ground in China and struggles to grow in North America—where its core brand has long struggled to be relevant—it cannot afford to be so bad at the future.
Enter Rivian, which is doing very cool things but needs cash to get past the enormously costly ""startup"" phase of its business, much like Tesla before it got the Model 3 and Model Y out in force. The investment from VW will help Rivian stay in the game. But it also establishes Rivian as a software powerhouse—something it hadn't really been known for until recently. Cool-looking electric SUVs, sure. But now the world is starting to view Rivian as a leader in tech as well.
Here's TechCrunch to explain just what VW is buying:
Rivian’s new electrical architecture and compute platform reduced the number of electronic control units (ECUs) used to control the vehicle from 17 different ECUs in its first generation to seven. This new zonal architecture allows Rivian to cut more than 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle—a 44-pound weight savings—and to build its vehicles faster.
That new electrical architecture—or what Scaringe describes as new vehicle topography—is seen internally as a key innovation at Rivian and one that allows the company to wirelessly update software. The new zonal architecture supports Rivian’s software stack, which was also developed and deployed in-house. That software stack includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.
So it's not just ""software"" here. It's a rethinking of how cars are designed and built entirely, something the VW Group has repeatedly tried and failed to do.
I think it's important to note that a Rivian partnership won't reverse VW's misfortunes overnight. Indeed, this partnership is going to take years to bear fruit. Likely, VW will find some way to buy time with more conventional products—hence the debuts of the updated Jetta and Golf R this week—and whatever EV rollouts it was already confident about until the electric race really heats up toward the end of this decade.
Rivian has a better shot at staying alive until then, too, which is great news for everyone who wants to pre-order an R3X. But it doesn't say much about ""legacy"" auto's ability to face the future on its own. VW's stock price slipped while Rivian's shot up 30% after the announcement.
Porsche Taycan Cutaway
I'd say the first part of the 2020s reflected a belief that the auto industry could just pivot to batteries and software fairly easily, because Tesla pulled it off, so how hard can it be when the real companies gave it a shot? But 2024 is where everyone is getting a badly needed reality check. See above for one of the highest-profile examples out there.
Over at the Detroit Free Press (subscription required), writer Mark Phelan lays out just how hard this transition has been, but also throws water on the idea that uneven EV adoption this year means electric power is ""done"":
So what's up with all the reports about automakers delaying plans for when, where and how many electric vehicles they’ll produce and sell?
They’re true, but they’re only part of the story.
General Motors and Ford have repeatedly said they are delaying the production of EVs, batteries and motors. GM just trimmed its 2024 EV sales forecast by 50,000 vehicles. Fiat Chrysler (now part of Stellantis), a slow starter, has yet to sell any.
Those developments and more fueled claims that EVs are a sham, toys for the wealthy and woke, unfit for use by the rest of us.
Are EVs doomed? Have automakers wasted precious time and resources rushing them into cul-de-sacs? Not a chance.
Remaking a 140-year-old industry is hard. In addition to the goofs and glitches that come with any new technology, virtually every major global automaker has either gotten out over its skis or has been lambasted for a slow and half-hearted strategy.
Phelan says something I really like: that automakers ""won the press conference,"" meaning they made big, bold announcements that seemed amazing, but were edicts their engineers and the infrastructure couldn't deliver on. Expect a lot more ""adapting to changing realities,"" as he puts it; more ups and downs, more canceled and delayed products, more pivots and more of an overall mess than anyone could've predicted.
GM Cruise Integrated AV System
And here's yet another example of transition headaches. GM's Cruise, which hit pause on operations last year amid high-profile crashes and only resumed service this month, named a new CEO yesterday: former Amazon and Microsoft executive Marc Whitten.
He seems legit, and Cruise needs the help getting back on track, CNBC reports:
Whitten was a founding engineer at Microsoft's Xbox before leaving the company after more than 17 years to become chief product officer of audio company Sonos in 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then worked at Amazon as vice president of entertainment devices and services before his most recent role as chief product and technology officer for software development company Unity's Create.
His appointment comes at a crucial time for Cruise, which is testing and relaunching its autonomous vehicles on public roadways. It ceased operations weeks after an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi. A third-party probe into the October incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership fueled regulatory oversights that led to the accident. The probe also investigated allegations of a cover-up by Cruise leadership, but investigators did not find evidence to support those claims.
Getting to the future is a real pain in the ass, isn't it?
2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Technical Cutaway
Like I said, every automaker has had troubles with this stuff. So who in your mind is doing it best? When it comes to EVs, I'd say Hyundai Motor Group, but it still lags behind on things like over-the-air updates. Plus, I don't think their ADAS technology is anything to write home about, at least as far as the passenger cars are concerned. And Mercedes has a strong software game, but a weirdly waning interest in EVs.
So which established player are you betting on? Or is the answer ""none of the above""?

Plug-In Hybrids Overtake EV Growth. But There Are Some Catches,https://insideevs.com/news/724181/phev-growth-overtakes-bevs-report/,A new report suggests that testing cycles and electric-only range need to improve vastly to draw climate benefits from PHEVs.,2024-06-24 10:30:18,"Plug-in hybrids are in a unique position right now. While the sales of battery electric vehicles have been steadily increasing over the past few years with policy and infrastructure support designed to favor them, consumers have recently shown that they’re interested in PHEVs, too.
For starters, PHEVs are a bridge between gas cars and BEVs. They have both, a gas engine and one or more electric motors powered by a small lithium-ion battery. The combination allows drivers to cover short distances, typically between 20-50 miles in EV mode only. When the battery depletes, you can either plug it back in or rely on the combustion engine, leaving not much scope for range anxiety.
PHEV growth outpaces EVs.
To be clear, BEV sales overall still vastly outnumber PHEV sales, but the latter has been gaining some traction in recent years. In part, that's because consumers are concerned about the high costs of owning a BEV and the lack of abundant and reliable charging and range anxiety.
This has led some to believe that PHEVs, and not fully electric cars, represent a more plausible electrified future—at least in the near term. However, research from BloombergNEF's 2024 Electric Vehicle Outlook has some caveats about the rise of such hybrids. It explains how adoption rates are skewed due to high sales mostly outside the U.S., where high-quality options have lured buyers en masse. And it also says that for automakers, increasing their all-electric range is a critical challenge seen as key to wider adoption.

So are PHEVs back in vogue? Well, the answer is yes, but there's a twist. They have become popular mainly in Europe and China, which together represented 90% of PHEV sales last year. In the U.S., they're not exactly hot sellers.
In Europe, customers have several great PHEV options. The Volvo XC60, Ford Kuga, BMW X1, Porsche Cayenne and Peugeot 3008 were some of the best-selling models in the continent according to JATO Dynamics data (via Statista).
China is a different beast altogether. The country became the largest PHEV market in 2022 thanks to an influx of affordable models from BYD primarily. But many other brands like Li Auto and Geely are also fighting it out for a bigger share of the market.
BYD Song Plus DM-i
According to car research firm Autovista24, five of the ten best-selling EVs in China in April 2024 also came in PHEV variants. The best-seller is the BYD Song, offered in both BEV and PHEV variants. BYD sold some 54,300 units of the Song in April 2024 alone. Its 18.3-kilowatt-hour battery allows 50 miles of zero-emissions range whereas the combined range is 671 miles.
Chinese customers are spoiled for choice with hot-selling options like the Aito A9, Denza D9 and BYD Qin Plug. This pushed plug-in hybrids to 30% of new passenger EV sales worldwide last year, slightly up from 2022 levels. In the US, they only hit 19% of all new EV sales in 2023. But that is also a record.
Stellantis sells more PHEVs than any other automaker. Its sales increased by 124% last year, thanks to models like the Dodge Hornet, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Alfa Romeo Tonale, Jeep Wrangler 4xe and the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe.
Toyota relies on plug-in hybrids, but not that much. Although, its PHEV sales growth in the U.S. has outpaced BEV sales. In Q1 2024, Toyota’s PHEV sales were up 94%, whereas BEV sales were up 84% (Including Lexus models).
BNEF found that automakers are increasing the electric range of their PHEVs to meet consumer needs. Globally, the average range of PHEVs rose from 33 miles in 2017 to nearly 50 miles in 2023.
The higher ranges are a result of larger and more energy-dense batteries. The average PHEV battery pack size reached around 15 kWh in the U.S. and Europe in 2023, compared to 26 kWh in China. And among them, the ones offered in the U.S. have the lowest electric range.
Since 2021, the average PHEV range in the U.S. has remained stable, at around 29.8 miles (48 km.) In Europe, it has declined from around 43 miles (70 km) to approximately 38 miles (61 km.)
In China though, plug-in hybrids have surpassed 57 miles (92 km) of all-electric range on average, nearly double what is available in the U.S.
2024 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid
""So when automakers say they want to bring PHEVs to the US, are they really bringing high-quality PHEVs with a longer all-electric range?"" Corey Cantor, a senior EV analyst at BNEF, told InsideEVs.
Providing a longer all-electric range, like what's available in China, could push drivers to use their PHEVs in electric mode more frequently, Cantor said. That's key because the environmental benefits of PHEVs can disappear if they're just used like gas vehicles.
""It doesn't mean it's a slam dunk or a sure thing,"" he said. ""But you have a better chance of getting consumers to charge up for longer periods than if you're adding 22 miles and have to be charging it constantly.""
What also expanded China's lead was range-extender EVs (EREVs). EREVs primarily run on electric power but have an auxiliary internal combustion engine or generator that recharges the battery when it gets low. This design extends the driving range beyond what the battery alone can provide, reducing range anxiety.
Nearly 30% of China’s PHEV sales were extended-range models in 2023, which have an average range of 79 miles (127 km).
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that the real-world benefits of PHEVs and those shown in government testing are vastly different. Their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, on average, are approximately two to four times higher than what’s seen in testing cycles.
The rated range is high because fuel-economy standards often make assumptions around emissions and electric range use. BNEF says this has to change. “Drawing from real-world data as PHEV penetration grows can help deliver more realistic policy design and tangible climate benefits,” the report states.

If you don’t charge a PHEV regularly, you’re just carrying the dead weight of the lithium-ion battery around. That leads to using more engine power and hence more fuel. This is also one of the reasons their cost of ownership is higher than ICE cars and BEVs.
BNEF said even the most efficient PHEVs are more expensive to own than average gas cars and BEVs. Assuming a 50% electric usage rate, BNEF found that the Toyota RAV4 Prime was still more expensive to own than a Tesla Model Y or a gas-powered or hybrid RAV4.
""From an automaker perspective, you want to get that electric mode utilization as high as you can,"" Cantor said. That unlocks the benefits of using less battery materials, qualifying for Inflation Reduction Act credits or having to build fewer EV chargers, he said.
""But if the utilization is still too low, then you're just going to be potentially harming the climate,"" he added.

GM EV Owners Still Can't Use Tesla Superchargers. Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/723885/gm-ev-supercharger-access/,"GM said Supercharger access would be online in ""Spring 2024."" Now we know more about what's going on.",2024-06-19 17:31:07,"With General Motors about halfway through what was meant to be a do-over year on the electric vehicle front, one major intended perk for its EV owners has yet to materialize: access to the Tesla Supercharger network. GM indicated that owners would be able to use America's best fast-charging network sometime in spring 2024.
But summer starts tomorrow, and a high-level industry source with knowledge of the Supercharger rollout tells us that GM won't hit that target. However, the company is in the ""final steps"" of the integration, so access should be coming soon. Here's what happened.
Supercharger Rollout Woes
Tesla has finally started opening up its Supercharger Network of fast chargers to other automakers. But right as the transition was picking up steam, Elon Musk fired almost all of the Supercharger team. That's cast doubt on the initial timelines, and automakers like Polestar have already announced that they won't hit their original target rollout date. GM targeted either ""spring 2024"" or ""the first half of 2024,"" depending on who you ask. But spring ends tomorrow
The first thing to know is that the deadline wasn't entirely set by GM. It was actually Tesla that put ""Spring 2024"" on its website as the target date for Ford, Rivian, Polestar, Volvo and GM vehicles. But apparently, automakers themselves didn't know that was the timing until Tesla posted it publicly.
Tesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North America
Even still, the company looked to be on track to deliver by the end of spring, something a GM spokesperson reaffirmed to InsideEVs on May 30. According to the source—who spoke to InsideEVs anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the process—that characterization was still accurate at the time.
""There were certain agreement-level details that needed to be finalized [and] couldn't be"" in time, they noted as one of the many last-minute hurdles. The ""last mile"" of getting access rolled out took longer than anyone expected.
One potential (but obvious) wrench in the plan may have been Tesla firing its entire Supercharger team in April, then scrambling to re-hire some of them after the ramifications of that decision became apparent. Still, it's not immediately clear why the process has taken longer than expected. Our source declined to comment on those discussions.
Tesla's Supercharger Fiasco
The software part of the plan, however, is done. The next batch of companies has had extra time to work on integration compared to rivals like Ford and Rivian, and our source doesn't think GM EV owners will face the same validation, handshake and payment problems that some Ford and Rivian owners have had while using Superchargers.
The source added that GM has the adapters in stock and ready to send out, and that Tesla has uploaded all of the different automakers onto its app.
Very soon, our source indicated—in the coming weeks, although they declined to give a specific timeline. ""There are a lot of variables to work through,"" they said.
Tesla does not respond to requests for comment from the media. GM, however, sent InsideEVs the following statement:
""We are working as quickly as possible to open up access to the Supercharger Network for our customers and delivering a seamless charging experience is our priority. GM continues to expand charging infrastructure throughout North America, with GM drivers currently having access to more than 195,000 chargers. We believe that access to charging is the best way serve our customers and grow the EV market.""
That work should pay off soon. When Supercharger access rolls out to GM EVs, we'll keep updating you on how to get adapters, how the charging process works and how our initial testing goes.
It sounds like GM has had time to get this right, so for the sake of a lot of new Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq and Equinox EV owners, here's hoping it's the smoothest rollout so far.

"A Kia EV3 Built In Mexico Could Be A Sub-$30,000 Electric Car",https://insideevs.com/news/723855/kia-ev3-mexico-production/,"Kia won't say where the EV3 will be built. But Mexico is a possibility, which would unlock tax credits to make it even more affordable.",2024-06-19 15:00:00,"Like the rest of the Hyundai Motor Group, Kia has been on a roll lately. While other automakers are easing off the accelerator on electric vehicles amid a weird year full of uneven demand, Kia is just straight-up going for it with new models like the EV9 three-row SUV. But nothing is as hotly anticipated as the Kia EV3, which should be one of the stronger contenders in the new race for smaller and cheaper EVs. And there's also reason to believe the U.S.-market Kia EV3 end up even cheaper than its targeted $35,000 price tag.
Buried at the bottom of a recent article in Korea's Business Post is a line speculating that Kia could begin EV3 production at its Monterrey, Mexico plant ""in the second half of next year."" A few publications have run with that news like it's confirmed, but no plans have been officially announced for the EV3.
The affordable EV race
Most experts now believe the next growth wave for EVs will be in the smaller, more affordable categories. Buyers are done with just being offered large, expensive luxury EVs and want cheaper options. With a targeted starting price around $35,000, the upcoming Kia EV3 could be a strong contender when that race kicks off.
It's important to note that this plan is entirely plausible, and if it happens—and I would say there's a strong chance it might—then it would allow the EV3 to qualify for tax credits when sold in the U.S. That could put its starting price tag in the sub-$30,000 range, if not less.
Here's why it's a viable plan: Kia elaborated last fall on its plans to build a global EV manufacturing apparatus with factories all over. Those include EV production facilities in Korea, China, the U.S., Eastern Europe and, yes, Mexico. Some of those factories would make the same models; others would build EVs specific to those regions and their unique needs.
Kia's factory near Monterrey has been open since 2016 and it already makes cars like the Forte and Rio, so it knows what it's doing on the affordable compact front. But being in North America should allow the EV3 to qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits when purchased, as some Mexican-made EVs do already, like the new Chevrolet Equinox EV. Moreover, the timing of that report makes sense as well; the EV3 goes on sale in Korea next month, followed by Europe toward the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2025. That's not an unrealistic timeline to set the Monterrey plant up to make the car.
Tax credits have been something of a sticking point for Kia and its corporate cousin Hyundai so far. Executives at the Korean automakers have said they were initially promised tax credits by the Biden Administration since South Korea is such an important U.S. ally. That later ended up not being the case as the tax credit system only incentivized EVs and batteries made in North America.
Instead, Kia and Hyundai have seen big sales wins through leasing, which does allow for an EV to qualify for the tax credit, no matter where it's made. Still, leasing isn't for everyone, and if automakers are serious about widespread EV adoption, then the incentives have to figure into purchases too.
The EV3 is projected to have up to 300 miles of range and will come in front- and all-wheel-drive forms. It will be available with two battery pack sizes: 58.3 kWh and 81.4 kWh, although for cost reasons it loses its bigger brothers' faster-charging 800V architecture. Still, it's not going to be too bad on that front, as Kia estimates a 10% to 80% charging time of 31 minutes.
Kia has every reason to try and pull off Mexican production for the EV3, but we won't know until we know. A Kia spokesperson declined to comment on the reports to InsideEVs, saying the automaker had nothing to announce yet on this front. With any luck, future announcements will bring good news for people who want more affordable electric cars.

The Fisker Bankruptcy Doesn't Mean EVs Are in Trouble. Here's Why,https://insideevs.com/news/723752/fisker-bankruptcy-ev-sales/,Fisker likely would've faced this same outcome if it had a gas engine under its hood instead of a battery in the floor.,2024-06-18 17:31:46,"Fisker Inc. is the latest electric vehicle startup to fail to cross the ""valley of death."" Last night, after months of struggles, the automaker announced that it would enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware District Court, starting the process of selling its assets and restructuring its debt.
What that means for the thousands of owners of its sole car, the electric Fisker Ocean SUV, is now extremely unclear. But it does mean that its namesake, CEO and design legend Henrik Fisker, has now overseen two failed automotive startups.
Fisker's Bankruptcy
After months of corporate cutbacks, rumors about bankruptcy advisors and slashed staffing, Fisker finally declared bankruptcy Tuesday. That leaves owners of its Ocean electric SUV in a bind, forced to choose between holding out hope for maintenance and support that may never come or selling their cars for a massive loss.
It would be easy to look at Fisker's troubles as symptomatic of the broader problems with the electric vehicle market in 2024, a time when sales are rapidly growing but not nearly at the pace that the industry expected. Many EV startups and established automakers are struggling with production issues, software bugs, defects and other challenges—not to mention the enormous financial costs of launching such radically different vehicles.
Fisker even alluded to this in its bankruptcy announcement: ""Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently,"" Fisker officials said.
Fisker Ocean Factory
But the fact is that Fisker likely would've faced this same outcome if the Ocean had a gas-powered engine under its hood and not a lithium-ion battery built into its floor. The automaker had unique problems from the get-go, from launching a product that many said was fundamentally incomplete to lacking a proper infrastructure for sales, parts and repairs.
""I don't think [the EV slowdown and Fisker's bankruptcy] are really related,"" Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF, told me in an email. He added that Fisker sold about 2,000 Oceans in the first quarter of 2024—a drop in the bucket compared to the 3.175 million EVs sold globally in the same period.
""In general, it could lead to more negative vibes towards EV startups and anxiety around the future of the market,"" Cantor said. ""But to me, this isn't an EV story, it's a Fisker story.""
If an EV slowdown is really underway, that isn't what killed Fisker; Fisker did that on its own.
Fisker Inc. was formed in 2016 and started production of the Ocean in 2022. It's often compared to two other EV startups that launched with similar timelines: Rivian and Lucid. But while Rivian found a niche with luxurious, off-road-capable electric SUVs and pickup trucks—it was actually first to market with the latter—and Lucid has delivered the most efficient and highest-range EVs on the market, Fisker's positioning always felt a little murkier.
The Ocean is an electric crossover. Rather than carving out its own unique space, that put it in contention with just about every other automaker out there. Nearly all of them sell electric crossovers. Going after the most popular segment in cars makes sense. But what did the Ocean bring to the table that was truly special or worthy of hype?
Sure, the Ocean is stylish and delivers an impressive 360-mile maximum range figure. But many EV crossovers look cool and deliver good range now. What did the Ocean do that the Ioniq 5 couldn't? Or a BMW iX? Or a Cadillac Lyriq? Or even the Tesla Model Y, which may be everywhere, but is for a reason? Plenty of early adopter types are into what's new and different, but the Ocean always seemed to lack a ""gotta have it"" factor that made other EVs stand out.
It's not as if Fisker didn't have other ideas. The automaker had several other planned designs, like the $29,000 Pear, the four-door convertible Ronin and, later on, the compact Alaska pickup truck.
Fisker Alaska
The future of any of those models is now in doubt. The Pear, Ronin and Alaska seemingly never made it past the concept stage. Even if Fisker's assets get bought by some new entity, those models are likely too premature to see the light of day.
That leaves us with the Ocean—just another electric crossover, except one that may end up orphaned by the company that made it.
When I interviewed Henrik Fisker for The Verge in late 2022, he boasted of the Ocean's record development time, which was about half that of most other cars. But according to multiple reports—including accounts from current and former employees who spoke to InsideEVs—that plan hinged on software updates and fixes to be deployed later on. And it turns out that was a very tall order.
Most reviews of the Ocean are rife with words like ""incomplete"" and ""unfinished."" Consumer Reports was especially scathing earlier this year, citing issues with the accelerator, ride quality, Bluetooth connectivity, the total lack of adaptive cruise control at the outset and more.
2023 Fisker Ocean
Veteran car reviewer Keith Barry said he had minimal confidence in the product after ""our experiences with buggy software, features that disappear and reappear, and promises that future updates will activate options we already paid for.""
Moreover, an utterly scathing test of the Ocean by YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee may have been due to the car's outdated software, but it's hard to believe an update would've fixed all of its problems. Even the owners who told InsideEVs they loved the cars also said they were getting sick of all the bugs.
""Other EV startups and legacy automakers would be wise to avoid Fisker's mistakes: ensure that key products are included in the vehicle from day one and not rely on the potential for software updates to rush products to market,"" Cantor said. ""Too often it felt as if Fisker let its desire to meet internal deadlines rush ahead of those responsibilities to its potential consumers.""
While just about every automaker is undertaking a big push for over-the-air software updates, including so they can offer new features worth paying for, Fisker's experience is proof that band-aids after the fact are no replacement for rigorous development.
Reports of the turmoil inside Fisker itself have spread like wildfire. Current and former employees have relayed stories of Henrik Fisker and his wife, COO and CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker, allegedly mismanaging the company while being obsessed with protecting their reputations. Those Fisker employees say the company's leaders aggressively micromanaged relationships with suppliers and cut costs at every turn, sometimes putting it odds with Magna International, the contract firm hired to build the Ocean.
What's worse, the company never quite figured out the basics of carmaking, including a functioning sales channel, an infrastructure to supply parts to owners and a means to repair vehicles. The sales process was often in utter disarray, Business Insider reported today. InsideEVs' own reporting indicates that Fisker employees sometimes had poach components from its factory and disassemble entire cars to get needed parts to customers.
While the company attempted to pivot from a direct sales model like Tesla uses to a dealership-centric one, that never materialized in time to save it.

""Establishing a new automaker takes a considerable amount of marketing, not to mention the proper distribution and retail networks that need to be built,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""Even if the company does not have a set dealership network, an organized method of delivery, maintenance and repair for these vehicles must be created because even modern vehicles need more than just over-the-air updates for the software.""
Had Fisker come to market with a stronger emphasis on the basics of carmaking, from testing to sales and customer service and beyond, it may have had more of a shot at the same long-term viability that other startups are aiming for.
In the end, it's important to remember that Fisker declared bankruptcy around the same period that General Motors, the Hyundai Motor Group, Ford and others saw huge sales gains, and competitors like Lucid and Rivian have new or updated products out or coming soon.
Plus, they're all worried about the rise of China's auto industry, which is singularly focused on electric vehicles. In hindsight, if Fisker was unable to even get parts in the hands of customers who needed them, it's hard to imagine it could've been a viable competitor to the likes of BYD and Geely.
""Making cars is really hard,"" Cantor said. ""And making electric vehicles is hard too. Fisker's bankruptcy isn't a part of the story linked closely to the overall trials and tribulations of the EV market, but closer to the classic difficulty with startup companies succeeding.""
Still, Fiorani said he wouldn't rule out new startup players coming in, even as so-called ""legacy"" automakers go big on EVs and software features too. But they can no longer afford to make the mistakes that Fisker made.
""With the current state of the EV transition, creating an EV startup would be a very big risk,"" he said. ""Too many players at the high end make it difficult to enter the market and generate higher profits needed to invest in lower-priced models to sell at higher volumes. Add in the higher interest rates today and venture capital is less likely to find its way into a no-name, high-risk startup.""

"Fisker, Maker Of The Ocean SUV, Files For Bankruptcy",https://insideevs.com/news/723669/fisker-inc-bankruptcy-chapter-11-official/,The company filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday and is planning on selling its assets.,2024-06-18 04:27:03,"The moment Fisker Ocean owners have been dreading is here. Fisker Group Inc., the operating subsidiary of troubled California-based EV startup Fisker Inc., officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware yesterday, citing “various market and macroeconomic headwinds.”
The company said in a statement that it is in “advanced discussions with financial stakeholders regarding debtor-in-possession financing and the sale of its assets.” In other words, the maker of the all-electric Ocean SUV is looking for someone to buy whatever remains of the company after months of turmoil.
What will happen to Fisker?
Designer Henrik Fisker's second venture in the automotive space, Fisker Inc., has been plagued with problems over the last year The company struggled with sales, quality issues, the availability of parts and more. According to our sources, Fisker employees were stripping parts off completed cars in Austria and shipping them to the United States in their personal luggage. It's unclear what will happen to the company's assets now as bankruptcy proceedings begin.
Production of Fisker’s sole product was paused at Magna’s factory in Austria last month as inventory piled up and prices were cut with hopes of getting some much-needed cash. A week later, Fisker’s Austrian subsidiary filed for reorganization, and now the company as a whole is officially going down the bankruptcy route.
More Fisker Stories
This is the second time in just 10 years that owners of a car that bears CEO Henrik Fisker's name have had to go through the uncertainties that are associated with the downfall of the company that built their cars. The first time was when Fisker Automotive, the company that built the Karma extended-range EV, went under in 2014. (The two companies had the same founder, but are separate entities.)
In modern times, Fisker Inc.’s financial woes were clear from the beginning of the year when it became known that the company burned through roughly $70 million per month on average in 2023 for a total of nearly $1 billion. Most EV startups burn immense amounts of capital in their early years, if they can endure them, but Fisker had its own unique challenges with its ""asset-light"" business model: depending on outside contractors to build the cars, while it focused on design and the customer experience. But Fisker spent much of the past year dealing with problems on the sales and repair side: primarily, getting cars to customers, quality issues buyers did not expect from an $80,000 luxury EV, repairing issues that came up and supplying parts for those repairs.
Meanwhile, the company was said to be beset by turmoil within, struggling with cash flow, reportedly mercurial founders, inadequate customer service and being seemingly unprepared for the intense logistics of running a car company.
Originally, Fisker planned on building 20,000 to 23,000 Ocean EVs at its contract manufacturer in Austria but ended up assembling roughly 11,000 in total, with about 5,000 cars still sitting in inventory, according to our calculations.
“Fisker has made incredible progress since our founding, bringing the Ocean SUV to market twice as fast as expected in the auto industry and making good on our promise to deliver the most sustainable vehicle in the world,” said a Fisker spokesperson in the official Chapter 11 announcement.
“We are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers’ hands in both North America and Europe. But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company,” the spokesperson added.
The company said that it would file all the necessary motions to ensure its reduced operations are able to continue, including paying employee wages and benefits, preserving certain customer programs and compensating needed vendors on a go-forward basis.
Fisker boasted that being an ""asset-light"" automaker allowed it to bring its first EV to the market faster than the industry average. But that same mentality could lead to big issues for Ocean EV owners, as the company has a paper-thin stock of spare parts, making simple repairs close to impossible. It could also make the company unattractive to potential buyers, as Fisker doesn't have its own manufacturing facility, instead relying on Magna's manufacturing expertise to put together a working car.

"Pork, Dairy, Booze: China To Hit Europe Back After New EV Tariffs",https://insideevs.com/news/723366/china-retaliatory-trade-tariffs-europe-electric-vehicle/,The Chinese government might slap tit-for-tat trade barriers in retaliation for EU tariffs on EVs.,2024-06-14 13:00:39,"Chinese companies are urging the government to slap retaliatory measures on European goods after the bloc imposed up to 38% tariffs on China's electric vehicle imports early this week.
Trade tensions between two of the world’s major trading partners have been soaring as China’s EVs are flooding European markets, threatening to uproot domestic players with high-quality and low-cost alternatives. China argues that its EVs are simply superior products and that the tariffs are unfair. As a result, Europe and China are now exchanging trade blows.
Trade war between China and the West.
After the U.S. slapped 100% tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports last month, the European Union followed with its own set of tariffs of up to 38% this week. Far lower than the U.S., but still damaging for an industry operating on slim margins. China, home to the world's largest car market, isn't sitting quietly.
China’s state-owned newspaper, Global Times, reported yesterday that Chinese companies will file an application with authorities to launch an “anti-dumping probe” into certain EU pork and dairy products. Reuters said, citing data from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, that the EU exports dairy products worth $1.8 billion to China annually.
Cars would also be impacted as China is considering hiking tariffs on vehicle imports from the current 15% to 25%. German automakers like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen would bear the brunt of these tariffs when they go into effect as China is by far the largest market in terms of unit sales.
These automakers have deeply invested in China. Certain German models, like the BMW iX3, are exclusively manufactured in China and exported to other countries. Many German automakers have JVs with local players for their Chinese operations. However, several models are imported from Europe, like the Mercedes EQS and EQS SUV, whose prices would soar after retaliatory tariffs.
BMW iX3 (2022)
This comes in addition to similar anti-dumping investigations into European goods announced early this year. Chinese authorities are scrutinizing Brandy and certain plastics that enter China from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Taiwan. Given the government's iron grip over its agencies, it would be difficult to decipher whether these are independent investigations or orchestrated.
Despite opposition from individual member countries and its own automakers, the EU slapped tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese EV imports this week. In an age of thin profit margins, these tariffs would make matters challenging for Chinese manufacturers, many of whom are parent companies of European brands. Geely Group owns Swedish automakers Volvo and Polestar, whereas MG Motors of the U.K. is owned by China’s SAIC.
After the EU slapped the new tariffs, a Chinese auto industry group representing local carmakers said this week that they're not discouraged from continuing to invest in Europe with local plants. Many European countries are enticing Chinese carmakers with subsidies to establish manufacturing to boost local economies and add thousands of jobs.

According to his celebratory posts on his social media network, X, things certainly seem headed in that direction as of Wednesday evening. Though Tesla will announce the final results of the vote at this afternoon's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, the CEO is already claiming victory.
Update 5:10 p.m. June 13: At Tesla's annual investor meeting in Austin tonight, company officials announced that Musk's pay package was indeed approved by shareholders. The original story follows below.
Musk's value and controversy
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, approved in 2018 but rejected by a Delaware judge this year, has been a source of intense controversy. Critics say Musk is distracted by his other ventures and hasn't delivered much for Tesla as of late, while his ardent supporters say he's key to the company's future—which he says will be driven less by cars and more by robotics and AI.
""Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins,"" Musk posted late Wednesday evening. ""Thanks for your support!""
If these results bear out today, they will reaffirm a controversial and unprecedented pay package he was granted in 2018 but that was rejected by a Delaware Chancery Court judge amid a shareholder lawsuit earlier this year. The other resolution would be to incorporate Tesla at its physical headquarters in Texas, not in Delaware, and Musk indicates that measure too is headed for approval.
The outcome, if true, may not be terribly surprising. While a number of large, institutional investment firms like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and Glass Lewis opposed Musk's pay package, saying the CEO has been distracted by his many other ventures as of late to the detriment of Tesla, Musk still enjoys immense support among a dedicated fanbase of retail investors.
And even if many of them didn't approve of his leading multiple companies at once—to say nothing of his public antics as of late, or even a Wall Street Journal investigation that came out yesterday and accused him of having sexual relationships with female SpaceX employees—those investors said they didn't want to risk the value of their Tesla shares plummeting if Musk were to leave Tesla. That was an outcome he and Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm strongly hinted at amid a massive public and social media push to get out the vote in Musk's favor.
In other words, if this vote does officially pass today, it's going to be seen as a stamp of approval for Musk's continued leadership of Tesla and his claimed plan to make it ""the most valuable company on earth"" thanks to investments in AI and the pursuit of fully self-driving cars.
However, as CNBC, Bloomberg and others note today, the vote alone does not clear the way for Musk's pay package to be reinstated. That's still working its way through Delaware's courts, which continue to take issue with the fact that Tesla's board of directors isn't a very independent one—although the vote could help tip the legal case in his favor. The company even said in a proxy filing that it ""cannot predict with certainty how a vote to ratify Musk’s compensation would be treated under Delaware law.""
So while Musk's pay package—which he has even said is tied to whether or not he'll stay at Tesla or pursue AI projects ""outside"" of the automaker—may not be settled for some time, today's vote will further cement the idea that ""Tesla is Musk, and Musk is Tesla."" For better or worse.

"Tesla Resumes Hiring: AI And Robotics Engineers, Service Technician Jobs Open",https://insideevs.com/news/723060/tesla-resumes-hiring-ai-robotics-software-engineering/,"After a brief hiring freeze last month, hundreds of positions are now open in the U.S.",2024-06-12 11:30:40,"When Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an internal memo regarding laying off “more than 10%” of his employees, he wasn’t messing around. “There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth cycle,"" Musk wrote in the email.
Shortly after the company announced dismissing some 20,000 employees worldwide, a hiring freeze went into effect. Tesla’s careers page which normally shows thousands of open positions went nearly blank, with just three training program listings.
Tesla's next chapter.
CEO Elon Musk's ambitions for Tesla go far beyond making the world's best electric cars. He wants to solve autonomy and pioneer artificial intelligence and robotaxis. After laying off some 20,000 people worldwide to reduce costs and restructure, Tesla is hiring again.
As the Austin-headquartered company prepares for a future of robotaxis and artificial intelligence alongside its passenger vehicle business, hundreds of those jobs are open again. Service advisors and service technicians make up the majority of the open positions on Tesla’s careers page.
It’s also hiring chemical operators for its in-house lithium refinery located in the greater Corpus Christi area of Texas. A closer look at some of the battery jobs reveals that Tesla is pushing ahead with the development of cells. Several research and development positions are open across “cell materials engineering,” “abuse test and engineering” and “high-voltage abuse test” among other similar roles.
There are also dozens of well-paying positions at Tesla Bot, the automaker’s artificial intelligence and robotics division in charge of fine-tuning the Full-Self Driving (FSD) software and improving the capabilities of its humanoid robots. Positions are also open across manufacturing, legal, operations, software, and more.
However, at the time of publishing, there were no roles open within the charging divisions. The majority of the 500-person Supercharger team that helped build the backbone of Tesla, was also part of the layoffs in April and May. Some of those employees have since been re-hired.
If the company wants to solve autonomy and trigger the next wave of growth—which has been in decline since the start of this year—it needs a lot of these talented people by its side.

"Americans Are Convinced Toyota, Honda, Nissan Lead The Way On EVs: New Survey",https://insideevs.com/news/722987/automakers-tricked-people-electrified-vehicles-evs-survey/,"Years of hybrid cars and ""electrified"" marketing terms have people convinced they're ahead.",2024-06-12 11:00:17,"BEV, PHEV, HEV, NEV and FCEV are all acronyms for some sort of electrified vehicle, but only one of them refers to all-electric cars. That would be BEV, which stands for battery electric vehicle, whereas all the others have some form of helper, be it a combustion engine or something else.
Furthermore, automakers using “hybridized” and “electrified” every chance they get to describe a car that–in truth–has an electric motor and battery washed away some of the meaning of an electric car.
Electrified doesn't mean all-electric
Automakers have been using every trick in the book to sell as many cars as possible since day one. Now, with the push toward electrification, some brands have turned to catchy words like ""hybridized"" and ""electrified"" to lure people into the world of electric cars, only to offer some sort of combustion engine, too.
We knew it, and you probably knew it, too, but now there’s a survey that uses hard data to show that car manufacturers’ marketing efforts paid off. They managed to fool people into thinking that slapping a badge containing “EV” on the back of their cars made them all-electric.
Toyota C-HR HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) badge
According to New Automotive’s opinion poll of drivers’ views on the EV transition in six countries around the world, the overwhelming majority of people think that an ”electrified” vehicle means “an electric vehicle powered 100% by a battery.” Over 70% of respondents in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, India and Indonesia answered like this, whereas far fewer people gave the true answer.
More Stories Like This
At the same time, however, the overwhelming majority of respondents said that a vehicle that’s powered 100% by a battery counts as an electric vehicle, which goes to show the scale of confusion among consumers.
Working on the percentage game, where carmakers usually report big increases in sales but bury the actual number of EVs sold in the footnotes, the poll revealed that this tactic also worked. In the US, respondents said that almost all car manufacturers sold more EVs than they actually did, with only Renault (which doesn’t sell cars here) and Mercedes-Benz getting lower estimates from the public.
The same extensive poll revealed that consumers in the target six countries would avoid buying a car from a company that’s associated with lobbying against EV policies and that they’d like manufacturers to be more supportive of the switch to EVs.
The majority of drivers in the UK (58%), France (51%), India (86%) and Indonesia (83%) want their own car brand to support policies to increase EV sales and phase out combustion car sales. In contrast, in the United States, that percentage is 47%. Moreover, 23% of Americans said they want their car brand to oppose such policies.
When it comes to Toyota, a car company famous for its foot-dragging approach to full electrification among EV enthusiasts and for selling only one all-electric car in the U.S., drivers across all countries surveyed tend to think that the Japanese automaker should aim for a higher percentage of EV sales by 2030 compared to its current plan of about 30% or 3.5 million EVs. On average, US drivers said Toyota should aim for 38% EV sales annually by 2030, while respondents in Japan said the company should aim for 52% EV sales.
“These results should give many of the largest car manufacturers pause for thought,” said Ben Nelmes, CEO of New Automotive. “Motorists are increasingly conscious of the impact that cars have on the environment, and they want cleaner cars. Advocating for climate policies to be weakened or watered down not only carries environmental risks but reputational and financial risks, too,” he added.

'Tesla’s Future Relies On His Presence': Musk's $56B Pay Vote Down To The Wire,https://insideevs.com/news/723041/tesla-musk-vote-preview-cm/,"How the Tesla shareholder vote tomorrow will go seems to be anyone's guess. Plus: more on the EU's China tariffs, and GM's Cruise is back.",2024-06-12 10:16:30,"We're now one day away from the Tesla shareholder vote that will determine the future trajectory of the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, and how it goes is anyone's guess. Will shareholders approve a controversial and legally disputed $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk? And if they don't, will he really walk, as he's often implied?
That kicks off this midweek edition of our Critical Materials morning news roundup, and what a busy week it's been already. Also on tap today: we examine the fallout from Europe's stiff new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, and General Motors' Cruise robotaxi operation gets a new lifeline. Let's dig in.
Elon Musk Cyber Rodeo Texas
Is there a Tesla without Elon Musk at the helm?
Assuredly so. But that's the wrong question to ask. The right question is, what is the stock price of $TSLA without Elon Musk at the helm?
And that question is the one that small retail investors and huge institutional firms alike are asking as they vote on Musk's unprecedented $56 billion pay package. The results of that election will be announced at the company's annual shareholder meeting tomorrow afternoon in Austin.
We've covered the backstory on this before, so I'll spare you the details here. But I will remind you that this vote doesn't negate the Delaware judge's decision to void Musk's pay package after a shareholder lawsuit; it merely gives more ammo for Musk to secure it on an appeal or through some other means.
Plenty of investors big and small are fed up with Musk's public antics, his apparent lack of attention on Tesla as he also runs SpaceX and the social media network formerly called Twitter, and his apparent pivot away from cars toward robotaxis and AI. Other investors may agree with all of that (or they don't!) but still won't want to see the value of their $TSLA shares get wiped out. Analysts predict an immediate decline on the heels of a ""no"" vote, which would go even further south if Musk does leave.
Here's the latest from the Wall Street Journal, including how Musk himself has spent a huge amount of time lobbying for the vote, perhaps even more than he's spent on Tesla itself this year. Emphasis mine:
Votes have been trickling in for weeks but it isn’t yet clear if shareholders will sign off on the package, according to people familiar with the matter. It will come down to how many of Tesla’s individual investors cast ballots, and how big institutional investors vote at the last minute, the people said.
Musk himself has been campaigning to get the vote out, tweeting on his X platform and even attending meetings with some large investors that he usually skips.
[...] Musk was supposed to talk about the future of Tesla, not lobby for his compensation in those meetings, some of the people said. But when asked, Musk has addressed the compensation debate and pitched investors on why Tesla’s future relies on his presence, according to some of the people.
[...] Big institutions, which normally sway the outcome, were split in 2018 and most aren’t expected to change their votes. The vote is expected to come down to individual investors who have flocked to the stock often thanks to Musk himself.
I've been arguing lately that there are really two companies here—Tesla, the carmaker, and $TSLA, the stock with a $543 billion market cap—and more money rides on the latter than the former.
Over at Barron's, Al Root writes that the answer is fairly obvious, and it's a ""yes"" in Musk's favor:
“I find it puzzling that some short sellers think institutions who are long Tesla, and are active managers, would vote no on Elon’s comp plan, which will almost certainly cause Tesla stock to fall and hurt performance,” says Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund co-founder Gary Black. His fund holds Tesla stock.
He has a good point. Large institutions can’t simply trade in and out of large positions. Voting against the package amounts to shooting themselves in the foot.
A no vote could send Tesla stock plummeting toward $150, according to market technicians.
[...]  Wall Street doesn’t vote, but analysts talk with clients that do. At least six brokers including Barclays and Morgan Stanley see re-approval happening. One broker, Bernstein, calls it unlikely.
That would be the short-term reaction. A no vote would force investors to consider Musk’s reaction, while leaving Tesla’s board of directors scrambling to compensate their CEO.
I do wonder how much last night's WSJ investigation into Musk's alleged sexual conduct with his female employees at SpaceX—including reportedly having a relationship with an intern—could move the needle. But at the end of the day, money talks and everything else walks.
If you haven't, I highly encourage you to read InsideEVs' report from Mark Kane this morning on the European Union's new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. The EU's counterpunch to the slew of rising Chinese EV sales is fascinating: it shows that the government body is also hitting back on its own automakers who build in China, like BMW and Dacia, and that not every country was in favor of this plan. They all have to do business with China, after all.
While the tariffs aren't as severe as the new 100% ones imposed by the United States, they do hurt. And they're already hurting shares of European automakers as investors worry about what happens when—more like if—China retaliates. Here's Reuters:
""The tariffs have turned out to be lower than many feared and are initially a plan that can still be revised. The measures are a disaster for European car buyers and for German car manufacturers,"" said Frank Schwope, automotive industry lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences FHM Hannover.
""China is by far the most important sales market for all German car manufacturers. However, French car manufacturers, for whom China is an insignificant market, would benefit from measures against Chinese imports to Europe,"" Schwope added.
Volkswagen and BMW, down around 1-1.8%, were among the worst performers on Germany's blue-chip index. Luxury German manufacturer Porsche Holding (was down over 7% as it traded ex-dividend.
Welcome to the Automotive Cold War, Europeans. Expect it to get a lot uglier, even as the whole world grapples with inflation already.
Eight months after halting operations after a number of disastrous safety mishaps in 2023, GM's Cruise robotaxi operation seems to be... back? Get ready, Phoenix, Dallas and now Houston: it's back. Here's TechCrunch on Cruise's new $850 million investment from GM to kickstart things again:
GM’s CFO Paul Jacobson announced the capital infusion onstage at Deutsche Bank’s Global Automotive Industry Conference on Tuesday.
“This will help bridge Cruise funding until we can find the right long-term capital efficient strategy, including potential new partnerships and external funding,” Tiffany Testo, a spokesperson for the company, told TechCrunch. She declined to elaborate on the types of new partnerships or how much money Cruise hopes to raise.
[...] Patrick Morrisey, VP of corporate communications at GM, told TechCrunch that the reduction in spending is still in effect, despite today’s capital infusion.
“The total reduction in spending announced earlier is based on the fact that Cruise’s total operating costs are lower in 2024 versus 2023 (operations paused for several months, smaller fleet, fewer cities, etc.…” Morrisey said via email, noting that Cruise still needs money to advance its technology. Just not as much.
The quest for fully autonomous driving is going to be a long one, and GM isn't about to give up what it's gained so far.

I'm not even sure where to put the odds anymore, but my current gut feeling is there's at least a 70% chance it will pass and only a 30% chance it won't. How do you see the vote going now?

Europe Hits Back: Chinese EV Imports Face Much Higher Tariffs,https://insideevs.com/news/723025/europe-impose-tariffs-chinese-ev-import/,"The EU penalized companies that didn't ""cooperate"" with the investigation more than others, and even targeted Chinese EVs built by BMW and Tesla.",2024-06-12 08:44:19,"The European Union will follow the U.S. and impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to defend its industry from what officials called ""unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers."" The move to raise tariffs comes at a time when many ultra-competitive and lower-cost EVs are undercutting European automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz on their home turf.
In the U.S., the tariffs on Chinese EV imports recently quadrupled from 25% to 100%. In the EU, the tariffs were at 10% but now may go as high as 38.1%, according to the provisional conclusion reached by the body.
China outpaced Europe and North America
China is the world's largest plug-in electric car market with sales levels exceeding the rest of the world combined. During the first four months of the year, more than 2.5 million plug-ins have been sold in the country (including 1.65 million EVs), taking 40% of the total volume. At the same time, Europe was under 1 million units (0.6 million EVs) and 21% plug-in share.
The European Commission—the EU's executive arm—had been investigating ""unfair subsidies"" across EV value chains in China for months, claiming that massive government financial assistance from Beijing was key in driving down the cost of cars and production to levels European automakers cannot compete with. The commission also said the new tariffs go into effect as soon as July 4 ""should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution.""
Interestingly, the new EU tariffs will not affect every Chinese EV manufacturer equally. The commission said that some automakers cooperated with the investigation more than others did. Those that were deemed to have participated will see lower tariffs than ones that reportedly did not, according to Reuters.
The new weighted average tariff for the companies who did cooperate in the investigation but have not been will be 21%. Other all-electric vehicle manufacturers, who were said to have resisted the investigation, will face tariffs as high as 38.1%.
Besides those general two categories, there are three individual duties for three known major Chinese producers:
Let's recall that SAIC has several brands such as MG, whose hot-selling MG 4 is quickly displacing purchases of European vehicles. Chinese conglomerate Geely also owns multiple brands, including Volvo, which is now working on how to produce more EV models in Europe, as well as Polestar, Zeekr and Lotus too. Several of those brands' EV models are made in China.
Because the car business usually does not operate on very high margins outside of the luxury segment, even a 5-10% increase makes competition challenging. The companies that will move from 10% to 38.1% tariff will have a really hard time—at least in theory.
None of the numbers above are yet definite. According to Reuters, the anti-subsidy investigation is set to continue until Nov. 2. Then Europe will probably see definitive duties, typically for five years, and maybe more individual duties for sampled manufacturers, including potentially Tesla as well—the Model 3 sold in Europe is made in China, for example.
That brings up an interesting point of this tariff policy: the EU even investigated and targeted its own automakers who also build cars in China and sell them in Europe, like BMW. Both the Bavarian automaker and Tesla are considered ""cooperating companies"" thus far, so they'll only face 21% potential tariffs for now.
Another interesting development is that not all EU countries were happy with the decision. The higher tariffs were opposed by Germany, which is heavily engaged in China; Sweden, which counts China's Geely as the owner of Volvo; and Hungary, which is also working with China on deep investments into things like battery manufacturing.
Now, the major question is whether or not China will retaliate. Counter-tariffs from China could impact the automotive industry or other goods imported from that country. According to the Associated Press, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian ""blasted the EU's investigation as 'typical protectionism' and said Beijing would 'take all measures necessary to protect our legitimate rights and interests.'""

"Volvo EX30, EX90 Production Could Divert To Europe Over China Tariffs: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/722740/volvo-ex30-ex90-production-diverts-to-belgium/,"Europe is adding tariffs on Chinese-made EVs too. Meanwhile, the fate of the U.S.-bound EX30 is unclear.",2024-06-10 09:27:14,"A month after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles from 27% to 100%, Europe is expected to reveal a similar crackdown on Chinese EVs this week. In anticipation of European tariffs, Volvo has announced that it would divert production of certain models from China to Belgium.
According to anonymous company insiders interviewed by The Times of London, Volvo is diverting the production of the EX30 electric hatchback and EX90 SUV to Belgium to avoid potentially disruptive tariffs that the European Commission is expected to announce soon. Production of U.K.-bound models will also be moved to Belgium, sources close to the company said.
An automotive trade war is brewing between China and the West.
Over the past couple of years, there has been a steady onslaught of cheap, high-quality Chinese EVs in Europe. The European Commission alleges that Chinese EVs are excessively subsidized. China rejects these claims. And now we're expecting a trade war.
Chinese carmaker Geely is the parent company of Volvo. The EX30 is manufactured at a Geely–owned plant in Zhangjiakou in northern China. The EX90 SUV is made at Volvo’s Daqing plant. Thankfully for the U.S. market, the three-row electric EX90 is also made at Volvo's plant in Charleston, South Carolina, so its American sales won't have to deal with any tariff headaches. The fate of the China-built EX30 is less clear.
Diverting the production of both these models to Belgium means Volvo would no longer need to halt their sales in Europe and other markets. That’s something the brand was previously considering, according to the report.
Europe is on the brink of a major trade war with China due to an influx of cheap Chinese EVs that threaten homegrown carmakers. According to a Transport and Environment analysis, one in four EVs sold in Europe this year would be made in China. This includes models from BYD, Polestar, Tesla, MG and more. (The EU is expected to set lower tariffs on made-in-China EVs from BYD, Geely and Tesla, according to Reuters.)
There’s also an ongoing anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese-built EVs by the European Commission. ""Their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market,"" President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech at the European Parliament last year.
However, the broader European auto industry seems opposed to the impending crackdown on Chinese EVs. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have all warned against the tariffs—HSBC estimates that German automakers generate 20-23% of their global profits from their operations in China.
The EX30 is a rare Chinese-made EV available in the U.S. as well. Because Volvo also has U.S. operations, like the South Carolina plant that also exports similar models, it qualifies for tariff refunds, according to trade law experts Reuters spoke to.
That means Volvo has so far offset the costs of those tariffs. Thanks to the cost advantages that come with Chinese manufacturing, the company hit a sweet spot with a $36,000 starting price, making it attractive for cost-conscious EV buyers. However, with tariffs on China-built EVs now at 100% instead of 27.5%, it's not clear if Volvo can absorb the impact like it once planned to.
InsideEVs reached out to Volvo USA last week for clarification on how the new U.S. tariffs affect the EX30, but hasn’t heard back yet.
Meanwhile, globally, the EX30 has been an instant sales hit. In the first Q1 2024, Volvo delivered 14,500 units globally. In May alone, Volvo delivered 11,000 units.
The EX30’s production in Belgium was expected to begin in 2025 after the company announced “strong demand” last year. That plant was expected to play a supporting role in addition to Chinese manufacturing. It now looks like European production will be fast-tracked due to impending tariffs.
Whether Volvo will be able to maintain the cheap $35,000 starting price for the EX30 with European production is something we’ll find out in due course.

VW Will Spend Billions of Its EV Development Budget on Gas Engines,https://www.motor1.com/news/722457/vw-invest-billions-gas-engines/,A full third of its nine-figure EV budget will be used to keep gas engines relevant as the switch to EVs slows.,2024-12-25 07:29:24,"It's fair to say the transition to EVs isn't going as some automakers had projected. Several car manufacturers are delaying their lofty goals to become purely electric in the foreseeable future. Of the €180 billion ($196 billion) set aside in 2023 for research and development, the German brand said it would use more than two-thirds on ""electrification and digitalization.""
Arno Antlitz, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer at the Volkswagen Group, has now clarified where the remaining third will be spent. The company intends to invest roughly €60 billion ($65 billion) to ""keep our combustion cars competitive.""
Speaking at an event held by Reuters in Munich, the CFO and COO added that ""the future is electric, but the past is not over. It is a third and it will stay a third."" As a reminder, the previous plan announced in late 2022 mentioned VW would go fully electric in Europe from 2033.
Last year, VW brand boss Thomas Schäfer referred to ICE as being ""old technology"" in the context of e-fuels. He described the discussions surrounding synthetic fuels as being nothing more than ""unnecessary noise."" That's despite the fact fellow VW Group brand Porsche is actively involved in producing synthetic fuel at a factory in Chile.
Other high-end marques from the VW empire are also keeping a close eye on how sustainable fuels evolve. Bugatti is even thinking of designing fuel stations that could be installed at the owner's home and filled up with synthetic fuel. Lamborghini believes the combustion engine could be saved by making it run on something other than fossil fuels. Bentley is also exploring nearly carbon-neutral fuels.
Speaking of the Crewe-based marque, Bentley has pushed back its objective to become EV-only by 2030, delaying it by three years. Similarly, Ford no longer thinks it can go entirely electric in Europe by 2030. Aston Martin recently reversed course as well and will continue to produce cars with combustion engines into the next decade.
It's clear that more and more car companies are reevaluating their EV strategies as people aren't willing to let go of ICE just yet. Automakers are in quite a predicament because emissions regulations are getting tighter, requiring investments to make gas engines run cleaner. At the same time, the electric offensive from China is a cause for concern for global players.

General Motors Had Its Best Month Ever For EV Sales In May,https://insideevs.com/news/722280/gm-ev-sales-record-may/,"Yes, really. Even without the Chevy Bolt. Here's how.",2024-06-05 15:47:59,"An unfortunate thing happened when General Motors discontinued the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV at the end of last year: its total electric vehicle sales cratered. It turns out that when you axe America's most affordable EV, as well as the best-selling EV in your lineup, and your portfolio of new EVs is dogged by production and software issues, well... things don't turn out so great.
Six months later, we might be seeing a very different General Motors. With little fanfare, the automaker just had its best month of all-electric vehicle sales ever in May, an outcome that would've sounded unfathomable not very long ago.
Are GM's EV woes in the past?
Production of GM's Ultium-powered battery cars hit several roadblocks in 2023, as did software issues that took one model off dealer lots for several months. Afterward, GM vowed to turn things around, and preliminary sales data indicates it may be doing exactly that.
GM CEO Mary Barra announced the news during last night's annual shareholder meeting. Curious as to how GM pulled this off even without the Bolt in its lineup, I asked David Caldwell, who directs finance and sales communications for the company, for more information. And he indicated that sales of the rest of the Ultium EV lineup seem to be making up considerable lost ground.
""We’re seeing strong demand and increases basically across the board, in particular Cadillac Lyriq and the new Chevrolet Blazer EV,"" Caldwell said in an email. ""[The] Hummer EV is building volume, as is the Silverado EV. Initial deliveries of the new Equinox EV occurred at the end of May.""
Caldwell added that ""the biggest impact comes from Lyriq,"" which saw more than 3,000 units sold in May. GM's total EV volume in the U.S. and Canada was more than 9,000 vehicles last month too. (According to past data, GM's previous ""best ever"" month for EVs would've been sometime in 2023, and around 7,000 electric units sold.)
It's key to note that we won't get exact details on GM's EV sales for a few more weeks.
Unlike other automakers, GM has reported its sales figures quarterly instead of monthly for the past few years—hence why tracking down its past monthly EV record is tricky. GM officials declined to provide detailed information on EV sales for May. But Caldwell said that the newest quarterly figures will be released around July 2 as the second quarter of 2024 comes to a close.
Still, there are several interesting trends to parse here. As Cadillac's global vice president John Roth told InsideEVs earlier this year, the Lyriq has had considerable ""momentum"" within the luxury brand, and it made up an impressive 17% of Cadillac's total sales in Q1. The Blazer EV also went back on sale after a three-month hiatus following reports of software issues, including by this publication.
Meanwhile, the Equinox EV seems poised to be a promising volume-seller thanks to its $35,000 (after tax credits) price tag and an even more affordable variant coming soon; as Caldwell noted, its sales are just starting to get underway.
GM has even more electric options coming this year, including the entry-luxury Cadillac Optiq, Escalade IQ and GMC Sierra EV. Sales of the consumer-spec Silverado EV are also just now starting to ramp up as well.
At the same time, GM too seems to be feeling the heat of an EV market that's less even and predictable than the auto industry imagined. High interest rates and fears around range and charging may keep more next-wave EV adopters away for now. Barra herself has begun admitting that an industrywide EV transition may actually take decades, and Cadillac has reversed course on phasing out internal combustion by the start of the 2030s.
Nonetheless, this news—limited in detail though it may be for now—is an outstanding development for GM and for the wider EV market. The automaker promised an electric turnaround for 2024, and it seems to making good on that right now. The General is also locked in a tight race with Hyundai Motor Group and Ford to see which company can collectively sell more than 100,000 EVs in a year, a feat only accomplished by Tesla so far.
If GM can keep delivering with this expanded EV lineup, it runs an extremely good chance of getting there next.

‘Foot On The Accelerator’: Hyundai And Kia’s EV Push Pays Off As Rivals Back Down,https://insideevs.com/news/721958/hyundai-kia-ev-sales-may/,"As American production looms, the Korean automakers race ahead with EVs. Hyundai’s American CEO says they’re just getting started.",2024-06-03 17:30:53,"Call it the “cold feet” era of the electric vehicle race.
Since the latter part of the last decade, nearly every major car company made a big show of their aggressive plans to expand their electric lineups, with some even committing to going all-EV. But for a lot of reasons, that path is proving considerably more difficult and protracted than they expected.
Hyundai, Kia pull ahead
The electric race is proving to be a kind of chicken race, but Korea's automakers say they aren't blinking—and have big plans reset what they do through battery-powered cars.
Dealer networks have been reticent to get on board. High interest rates have turned buyers off to EVs’ often more expensive prices, as have continued concerns about charging. Some new models have gotten lukewarm receptions from longtime fans. Pivoting their century-old industry to one focused on batteries and software has been exceptionally tough, and investors have balked at the enormous capital costs involved.
And with the world’s top EV seller seemingly focused on AI and robotaxis instead—not to mention a looming U.S. presidential election where one candidate seems dead-set against the technology—many automakers may be seeing this moment as one where they can ease off the accelerator a bit.
But easing off isn’t in the cards at Hyundai, the Korean automaker’s American CEO told InsideEVs recently. And the proof has been reflected in sales numbers that fuel plans for future growth.
“We're sticking firm with our plans and our long-term electrification strategy,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker said in an interview. “No pun intended, but we're gonna keep our foot on the accelerator. If consumers start to think about purchasing any EV, I want them to consider Hyundai first.”
Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor America CEO
The success of Hyundai has proven to be a kind of bright spot in an uneven and unpredictable year for EV adoption. And the same has been true lately of its corporate sibling Kia.
Both brands have had good news to share in recent weeks. May brought Hyundai its best month ever for the Ioniq 5 crossover, with sales up 82% over the same period last year. Kia had a similar “best month ever” story for all of its electric vehicle sales, including the critically acclaimed EV9 three-row crossover.
Even the Kia EV6—whose facelifted version has not yet gone on sale—has seen a significant increase in year-to-date sales over 2023. And while it’s about a year away from sales in North America, the compact Kia EV3 has already made a big splash with prospective buyers seeking more affordable electric options.
And all of that is before the Hyundai Motor Group’s big North American production push, which begins in earnest soon. The first Kia EV9 rolled off the assembly line last week at the automaker’s West Point, Georgia plant. The following day, Hyundai announced the Ioniq 5 would be made at the new joint “Metaplant” in the same state as well later this year. (Hyundai and Kia are both owned by the Hyundai Motor Group; while they share hardware, top corporate leadership and some production facilities, they operate as separate entities.)
“With model development in line with consumer needs and strong vehicle supply, Kia continued its sales growth momentum in May,” said Eric Watson, Kia America’s vice president of sales, in a recent news release. “Kia offers a balanced mix of electric, hybrid and ICE models that are meeting customer demands, and we expect to see increased showroom traffic and transactions through dealers.”
Parker said that Hyundai’s EV lineup is already being heavily advertised in a new campaign airing during the NBA playoffs. While other automakers have taken pains in recent months to play up their hybrid lineups—”Which we have,” Parker said—as EV sales have ups and downs, the CEO said right now Hyundai wants to “drive the EV narrative.”
“At the end of the day, if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, it's got to be done through EVs,” Parker said. “I don't think any [automaker] right now is really touting EVs as performance vehicles like we are.” And the hybrids are doing well too, especially the Santa Fe Hybrid crossover; “Hotter than a pistol, can't keep them in stock right now,” he said.
2025 Kia EV6
And like Kia, which openly admits that it “relaunched the brand” in 2021 with a new logo and cars like the EV6, Hyundai is also using its electric cars to get people to think differently about a company once known for cheap subcompacts. High electric ranges, compelling designs and Tesla-rivaling battery tech have changed a lot of perceptions about both brands.
“Ultimately, what we're trying to do is improve the brand image, the awareness and the consideration for the brand,” Parker said. “But at the same time, we want to make sure that we give consumers confidence when they purchase an EV from us.”
For that, he said, “the proof is in the pudding.”
“We're adding American manufacturing jobs,” Parker said. “And we're addressing the top EV concerns, the number one of which is the purchase price.”
Indeed, cars like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 have been known for their aggressive lease deals. As of this writing, the crossover—which offers up to 303 miles of range—can be leased for $229 a month and $3,500 due at signing for an SEL model. The Ioniq 6 sedan can be had in 361-mile SE form for just $189 a month and $1,999 down, which gets a buyer one of the higher-range EVs on the market right now at any price.
Leasing has been a big hit for Hyundai, Parker said. Around 60% to 70% of both EVs get leased, he added, which is much higher than the brand’s other cars. (He declined to elaborate on leasing rates for other Hyundai models but said they are ""much, much lower."") He has told InsideEVs in the past that both models continue to be profitable at those lease prices, although the extent of their margins is unclear.
That situation is also born out of necessity. Because the Ioniq models are currently built in Korea and not North America, they do not qualify for the $7,500 EV tax credits unless they are leased—contrary to what the automaker believed would be the case with the Biden Administration’s new rules. After that decision happened, Hyundai’s EV sales began to lag behind those of Ford, but these leasing deals have helped propel the Korean company back to the front of the race.
As Bloomberg recently reported, Ford, General Motors and Hyundai could each hit 100,000 EVs produced this year, something only Tesla has done to date. (Reaching that sales mark, however, may be a different story; with a total of 20,971 Ioniq vehicles sold by the end of May, it may only be achievable if Kia’s results are counted as well. Neither brand breaks out sales data for electric versions of its gas vehicles, like the Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona Electric.)
At the same time, GM is just now ramping up production of more affordable models like the Blazer EV and Equinox EV after a year of technical headaches. And while Ford continues to post strong sales of its F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E, adoption isn't happening as fast as it predicted, and now the Blue Oval brand is pushing back plans for future models and singing a different tune about hybrids. In other words, the race to 100,000 EVs could be Hyundai and Kia's to lose.
And the Metaplant in Georgia could be their ace in the hole. Due to go online in October, the Savannah-area factory has a capacity to build up to 300,000 Hyundai, Genesis and Kia EVs annually, adding more than 8,000 jobs in the coming years.
And that situation around tax credits and leasing is evolving quickly. With the EV9 and soon Ioniq 5 being U.S.-built, both cars should eventually be able to qualify for at least some of the tax credits when purchased.
Parker seemed confident that would be the case for the Ioniq 5, but wants to wait until the ink is dry; “If they were coming off [the production line] now, they would qualify, but I can never predict the future,” he said.
Hyundai Seven Concept
Even if Hyundai’s EV models somehow don’t get the tax credit, Parker said plans continue unabated. Unlike competitors, plans for new models aren’t being pushed back. Hyundai is still on track to release a three-row crossover called either the Ioniq 7 or Ioniq 9 later this year.
And while the company hasn’t said where it’s going to be built, the success of the similar Kia EV9 in the U.S. and this country’s endless appetite for three-row crossovers makes it seem like an obvious contender.
Parker declined to give more details about that crossover, or speak to what could become an inter-family rivalry between Hyundai and Kia for market share in the electric three-row space. But he did say it’s worth waiting for. “We've got high expectations, and we think the car is gonna perform extremely well,” he said.

Most Americans Would Still Buy ICE Vehicles And Hybrids Over EVs: Survey,https://insideevs.com/news/721896/americans-buy-ice-over-evs/,There seems to be a gap between automakers’ EV sales expectations and the reality of the car-buying public's preferences.,2024-06-03 13:30:58,"Even though Americans seem open to buying electric vehicles and automakers are enthusiastically pushing them to market and announcing grand electrification plans, we still have a long way to go until mass EV adoption. Several studies have been conducted over the last few years that have suggested American car buyers would much rather pick a pure combustion car or a hybrid over an EV, and a new survey seems to confirm not much has changed.
KPMG posted the results of its first-ever American Perspective Survey, which compiled the answers of 1,100 adults across the country and 400 additional people from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. Among the many insights it provides is a look at Americans’ desire to buy an electric car to help with the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Car buyers would rather pump gas than plug in
While there have never been as many car buyers in the US who are considering an electric vehicle, they're still about one in five, which is a lot less than in China with its much broader spectrum of available EVs.
Only 20% (or one in five) of those questioned said they would choose an electric vehicle over a combustion or hybrid car. The largest proportion of respondents (38%) said they would still buy a pure-combustion car, while 34% said they would opt for a hybrid. The propensity toward buying hybrids was slightly higher on the West Coast, where 43% of buyers said they would get a hybrid.
According to the survey, one of the main reasons people wouldn’t buy an electric car today is that they would spend too much time waiting for it to charge. It found that 60% of respondents wanted EVs whose batteries could be charged in 20 minutes, which is currently only a handful of the electric models available on the market—the Hyundai Ioniq 6.
However, the Ioniq 6 is one of the quickest-charging EVs available (thanks to its 800-volt architecture), and it takes 18 minutes to charge from 10 to 80%. This can only be achieved in ideal conditions with a powerful enough charger, so it also depends on the performance of the EV charging network.
One significant omission of this study seems to be the cost of EVs. There are hardly any affordable EVs in America, and the prospect of getting sub-$20,000 models on the market in the near future is unlikely (although a plan appears to be taking shape). Another recent survey paints a slightly different and more nuanced picture of Americans’ car-buying preferences. It suggests people would consider EVs if more affordable models were available, even if they came from China.
The Chinese car market is an interesting case study from another big car market, where the shift from combustion to electric has been much quicker. One of the big reasons more Chinese buyers are considering EVs is that they have many more models to choose from over a much broader price range, which starts at under $10,000 for a fully-fledged small car like the popular BYD Seagull.

"Tesla Semi Impressions, Production Timeline Announced At ACT Expo",https://insideevs.com/news/720980/tesla-semi-first-ride-spec/,"After several false starts, Tesla aims for volume production of the Semi in 2026.",2024-06-01 12:00:23,"Since its initial reveal in 2017, the Tesla Semi has remained elusive. The long haul truck was initially slated for production in 2019, but has been plagued by delays. The first trickle of deliveries finally began in December 2022, but between then and Q1 2024, less than 150 units were produced.
Most production has gone directly to Tesla's company fleet. PepsiCo is the only Semi customer to actually take delivery, although only 34 of the 100 orders placed by PepsiCo have been fulfilled so far.
So last month, Tesla took the stage at the 2024 Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT) in Las Vegas to assure the world that the Semi is still on track, even if progress is moving more slowly than expected. Senior Manager Dan Priestley says Tesla is committed to the electrification of the trucking industry, stating that they “look forward to bringing our experience with EVs and supporting infrastructure to tackle electric heavy trucking at scale.”
At the event, Priestley also announced that an additional 50 Semis would soon join PepsiCo’s fleet. This news follows reports that big box retailers Costco and Walmart have also launched pilot programs.
Of course, this is just a preamble to the automaker’s future ambitions. Last year, the company announced a $3.6 billion factory to support Tesla Semi production in Nevada. Construction of the facility began in January of this year. Mr. Priestley says Tesla is aiming for volume production in 2026, eventually producing as many as 50,000 units a year.
Hands-on and test-ride experiences were also available at the show. Kyle from the YouTube channel Out of Spec Reviews got to experience the Semi up close for the first time. While his presentation is light on technical details, it provides a good overview of the truck’s features and capabilities.
One of the first things Kyle showcases is the storage area located behind the main cabin. This is accessed via an exterior hatch situated just behind the main cabin door. While the Tesla Semi has a lot of space in the cabin, there is a lack of dedicated storage. So, this storage solution will certainly come in handy for drivers.
We also get a quick look at the Semi's Megawatt Charging System (MCS) port. The MCS charging standard can transfer a whopping 3.75 megawatts of power to large electric vehicles like the Semi. While early units of the Semi feature an MCS v.2 plug, future production will employ the newer v.3 design.
The unusual center seating position remains the interior's most standout feature. The rest of the styling, displays, and user interface will be familiar to anyone who has driven a Tesla. One interesting tidbit is that over the past 1,800 miles, this particular truck’s efficiency has been 1.7 kWh / mile. Although it is unknown whether these miles were tallied while hauling freight, the numbers are in line with what Tesla promised for the vehicle when carrying cargo.
While Out of Spec was able to spend time riding shotgun in the Semi, they couldn’t film the experience. Thankfully, Andre from the TFL was allowed to record his ride-along.
After one of Tesla’s engineers takes the wheel of the Semi, Andre is given a rundown of the truck and its capabilities. Currently, the long-range model is still the only version to enter production. Sporting a massive battery pack estimated at 850 - 900 kWh, the Semi has a tri-motor configuration and over 1,000 hp.
A single motor “efficiency drive” axle is located in the rear and operates at all times. A dual-motor “torque-drive” axle is located in front and provides most of the truck’s power under heavy load. This front axle is utilized only when necessary, sitting dormant whenever possible to improve efficiency.
Since Andre has his own commercial driver’s license, he immediately notes the calm and quiet cabin experience compared to a traditional diesel engine. The cabin is also free of the creaks and rattles you often find in ICE truck platforms converted to hybrid or electric drive. The familiar Tesla user interface is also appreciated, as is the truck’s large, easy-to-access door located on the back side of the cab.
“I got to say, it seems very refined."" Andre says. ""Very nice as far as how the cab is built, the accessibility of it, the capability of it.” While he may not have been behind the wheel, he was impressed with the Semi’s ride, range, and charging capabilities.
Still, he notes that the limited availability of megawatt charging holds back its current potential. “I would say for shorter trips, it’s hard to beat. For cross-country trips, it’s a different story.”
With missed production goals and slow deliveries, there is no doubt that the Semi has had a rough launch. But it is good to see progress on the Nevada production facility and a new batch of trucks on their way to customers.
Do you think Tesla will finally hit volume production in 2026 as planned? Or are we looking at another false start? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Genesis Will Use Lucid Electric Motors In Its Upcoming Electric Convertible: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/721635/genesis-hyundai-lucid-motors-report/,"Lucid Motors already has deals with Aston Martin and Formula E, so it’s no surprise that other companies are reaching out.",2024-05-31 13:00:00,"Lucid Motors, the maker of the Air luxury electric sedan, is also in the business of making and selling electric motors to other companies. The American startup is the official supplier of front e-motors to Formula E teams, and Aston Martin recently shook hands with Lucid to get its hands on ready-made motors for its upcoming EVs.
Now, Genesis, Hyundai Motor Group’s luxury brand, will reportedly do the same, at least for its upcoming flagship electric convertible.
The EV puzzle
Compared to a conventional gas-powered car that has thousands of moving parts, an electric vehicle is much simpler. There are just a few major components and most of them can be outsourced from other companies. Now, Genesis, Hyundai Motor Group's luxury brand, seems to be doing just that.
According to South Korea’s Sisa Journal (via Drive Tesla Canada), Genesis is in the final stages of negotiations to buy a batch of electric motors from Lucid Motors. Even though Hyundai is neck-deep in creating its own modular electric platforms and drive units, the source claims the timing doesn’t allow Genesis to fit its in-house developed motors in time for launch.
Officials from both Lucid and Genesis declined to comment on any potential future product news.

"EVs Or Hybrids? At Jeep, The Future Is Whatever You Want It To Be",https://insideevs.com/news/721697/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-gladiator/,"""We’ll either amp up, or maybe pump the brakes on where the [EV] technology adoption rate is, and let the customer choose,"" a Jeep exec says.",2024-05-31 09:34:58,"The brand behind America’s best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle has a lot more coming on the electrified front. And the menu of options will be pretty long.
This week, Jeep introduced the production Wagoneer S, the brand’s first battery-electric vehicle intended for global sales, at an event in New York City. During the unveiling, recently-appointed Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa also confirmed that, by the end of 2025, the Jeep Gladiator truck, Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer will all offer optional 4xe plug-in hybrid options.
Jeep's electrification strategy
Jeep is new to the fully electric space, but its plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe has proven extremely popular. It will run the same playbook in the next few years as more EVs and hybrids get added to the family.
By 2027, Filosa said, Jeep will have two BEV offerings—Wagoneer S and boxier and more rugged-looking Recon—several 4xe range-extended hybrids, and conventional internal-combustion vehicles. Which propulsion technology will define Jeep’s future? The answer, for now, seems to be a definitive “we’ll see.”
“The priority, first and foremost, is growth,” Bill Peffer, Senior Vice President and Head of Jeep Brand, North America, told InsideEVs at the Wagoneer S media preview. “We’re doing it through a strategy of freedom of choice. We’ll either amp up or maybe pump the brakes on where the [EV] technology adoption rate is, and let the customer choose.”
Growth is a bit of a concern for Jeep at the moment. To set the stakes for this diverse electrification strategy, it’s key to note that Jeep’s plan to move more upmarket, often with $100,000+ SUVs, has largely backfired. As a result of these increased prices—and with no small thanks to rising interest rates—Jeep has seen a steep sales decline in recent years. U.S. Jeep sales were down more than 300,000 cars in 2023 from their peak in 2018, a trend Filosa and his team are urgently trying to reverse.
But Jeep is going to do that in ways that don’t involve as many of the big, gas-guzzling engines it depended on in past decades.
During a keynote speech preceding the unveiling of the Wagoneer S, Filosa told journalists that Jeep currently offers models in about 45% of vehicle segments—and the company wants to reach 85%. The all-electric Wagoneer S aims to compete in the “premium midsize utility vehicle” market, one rung above the current Grand Cherokee. (That may also inform why Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares announced a $25,000 electric Jeep model, but that vehicle is probably years away.)
2023 Jeep Wrangler Willys 4xe
“This is the first time we’ve offered a fully battery-electric version of a Jeep,” Peffer said. “We can expand and try to conquest some of our [EV] competition—they're big and we won't name 'em, but we've got our eyes on who else is competing in that space, and we want some of it.” In new ads, the Wagoneer S is clearly aimed at the Tesla Model Y, so even if Peffer won’t say it, it’s picking a fight with the biggest guy in the yard.
The trick, according to Peffer, is to enter this new territory without disrupting the conventional Jeep customer. “It’s exciting for us because with our existing lineup, we already enjoy some of the highest loyalty. Grand Cherokee's got the highest loyalty in the segment, over 35 percent. So we don't want to abandon our customer base.”
The Wagoneer S is built on Stellantis’ new STLA Large platform, a modular architecture destined to underpin products from Dodge, Jeep, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, and Maserati. Despite its name, it is mechanically unrelated to the current gas-powered Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.
STLA Large was designed “from the bottom up” as a BEV platform, Peffer told InsideEVs, but the architecture can accommodate hybrid and internal-combustion drivetrains too—and at the Wagoneer S launch event, Jeep representatives were quick to indicate that the company is willing to pivot to whichever propulsion system fits the moment.
“We're not trying to be evasive, but we're looking at the dynamic of where the market is,” Peffer said. “We’re not the first into this [EV] space, there are other competitors already there. So we’ve learned a bit, we’ve watched the industry, we’ll watch what happens in the segment, [and] we can amp up or we can throttle back a bit.”
A similar strategy is playing out across the rest of the Stellantis family of brands. The new Ram 1500 Ramcharger uses a version of one STLA electric platform with a gas engine as a range extender, and Fiat is also adding an engine back into the previously all-electric new 500. While the conglomerate is going big into the all-electric space after years of lagging behind some rivals, it’s also building in ways to hedge its bets. That may not sit well with the hardcore EV faithful, but the success of the plug-in Wrangler 4xe may show that the company is onto something.
Asked specifically about the possibility of a Wagoneer S with a range-extending internal combustion engine, Peffer was noncommittal. “I can't confirm a specific technology like a range extender, but the flexibility of STLA provides opportunities which are interesting, right? The platform's built to allow for that flexibility and move as the market moves.”

The U.S. Government Wants A Competition To Build One",https://insideevs.com/news/721571/competition-to-build-16000-dollar-american-ev/,"The sub-$10,000 BYD Seagull has made American automakers restless. A U.S. official has ideas on building our version of it.",2024-05-30 12:30:12,"The sub-$10,000 BYD Seagull is a tour de force representing China’s strong lead in the global EV market. Some of the cheapest EVs in the U.S.—like the Nissan Leaf—cost three times as much before tax credits. Now, a member of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (Arpa-E), a technology incubator under the U.S. Department of Energy, said that doing things differently could help the U.S. build a Seagull fighter.
Halle Cheeseman, a program manager overseeing next-generation battery programs at Arpa-E, told The Information that a potential solution to spur innovations is to host a competition to develop a high-quality U.S.-manufactured EV that would cost approximately $12,000 to build and retail for around $16,000.
High costs jeopardize EV adoption. But low-cost EVs seem imminent.
The high purchase price of EVs has obstructed the wider adoption of climate-friendly electric cars. Expensive batteries and capital-intensive development and production contribute the most to this problem. But things are slowly streamlining and EVs might reach price parity with gas cars sooner than we think.
Cheeseman's proposal, presented at an Arpa-E conference in Dallas last week, underscores the growing concern among U.S. officials about the influx of inexpensive Chinese EVs into the American market. There now appears to be a genuine desire to take steps beyond just imposing tariffs on Chinese imports.
The Seagull is the result of China’s vast local and national subsidies, manufacturing scale and its stranglehold on the battery supply chain. BYD also has one of the highest amounts of vertical integration of any automotive company. Most of its parts, including the chips and the battery, are manufactured in-house.
“We are being beaten, and we're being beaten badly,” Cheeseman told the news outlet. “We need to do something differently.” According to him, the U.S. can tackle this problem by accelerating the adoption of robotics and 3D parts printing in factories, increasing the role of utility companies in battery ownership and leaning on technologies such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G).
Broadly speaking, robotics can enhance precision and efficiency, reduce labor costs and minimize production line errors. 3D printing could speed up the production of complex parts. Together, these systems may enable more efficient production lines and potentially create lighter, more efficient EVs, all contributing to lower overall costs.
But they come with high initial investments, and their integration could be a nightmare—something evident in the Tesla Model 3’s “production hell” era.
Cheeseman said Arpa-E’s senior management could take a year to select a concept as an official program. The program could last up to three years, during which $30 million would be distributed among competing teams. If a team’s solution seems truly promising, they’re given a chance to scale up.
Proposals like the affordable EV could take up to a decade to reach commercial scale and are contingent on how fast automakers incorporate any breakthroughs.
Another potential solution is letting utilities pay for and own the battery pack, which could drive down the purchase price for consumers. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which can feed power back into the local grid from an EV’s battery pack during emergencies or power cuts, could reduce the need for traditional powerplants, according to Cheeseman.
V2G is in a nascent phase, with a handful of EVs like the Nissan Leaf and Ford F-150 Lightning offering the feature. Even then, local utility companies must conduct necessary compatibility upgrades for the grid to accept power from an EV’s battery.
The U.S. is on track to witness several affordable EVs starting as soon as 2025 and 2026. These EVs would be more expensive than Cheeseman’s $16,000 target, but still cheaper compared to today’s prices. And they would likely arrive much faster than a direct Seagull fighter ever could—unless some breakthrough alters the whole landscape.
Tesla is working on affordable models, General Motors recently said that the next-gen Bolt EV would be its cheapest EV, Stellantis confirmed this week that a $25,000 Jeep was on its way and Volkswagen’s $21,000 EVs will premier in 2027.
Whether through government-funded programs or private-sector initiatives, cheap EVs are coming.

Volkswagen Dealers Say The ID.7 Wouldn’t Be Competitive In The U.S.,https://insideevs.com/news/721535/volkswagen-id7-delay-dealers-uncompetitive/,"Even though the ID.7 didn’t have an official price tag for the U.S., dealers feel like it would have been a $50,000+ EV.",2024-05-30 08:42:07,"The Volkswagen ID.7 was supposed to arrive at dealers in the United States toward the end of this year, but the German company delayed the electric liftback’s launch here because of “changing market dynamics."" Now, American dealers are chiming in and saying that they mostly support the move, as a flagship mid-size five-door EV would be a tough sell stateside, especially considering a hypothetical starting price of $50,000.
Add in the fact that the ID.7 is built in Germany, meaning the $7,500 federal tax credit when purchasing is out of the discussion, and you get a slow-selling car even before the first units set sail from Europe.
The ID.7's course
The Volkswagen ID.7 electric liftback was supposed to replace both the Passat and Arteon in the United States. Now, its future here is uncertain as the market for a $50,000+ mid-size sedan that isn't a Mercedes-Benz, Audi or BMW doesn't really exist, according to VW dealers interviewed by Automotive News.
The vast majority of Volkswagen dealers in the United States support the delay of the ID.7, according to John Luciano, owner of Street Volkswagen in Amarillo, Texas, and a member of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council.
More ID.7 Stories
""We brought up a little bit of caution behind it,"" Luciano told Automotive News. ""Are we sure this is a good idea? We didn't know the exact pricing, but [it's] definitely a $50,000 to $60,000 car, without incentives. Is there any chance of it being competitive? And we felt like [it's] not.""
Anthony Scala, co-owner of City Auto Group, which has three Volkswagen dealerships in the Chicago area, said that the ID.7 hasn’t spurred the interest of prospective buyers as the ID.Buzz minivan that’s slated for delivery in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.
""I just don't think an expensive electric sedan is in the cards for most Americans right now,"" Scala said. ""North of $50,000 for a sedan that doesn't have the star logo, the ring logo or the BMW logo?"" Scala added, referring to Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW. ""It's a non-starter.""
Moreover, in recent years in the U.S., Volkswagen has struggled to sell sedans, period. While the Jetta remains perennially popular, the Passat was discontinued amid slow sales. The ID.7 was billed as an effective replacement for the Arteon sedan, but that was never terribly popular, either. VW has shifted its lineup to being largely SUV-focused in response.
In Europe, the ID.7 has been on sale since last year and, according to Volkswagen, it has seen higher-than-expected demand, especially in its home country of Germany. In North America, however, the delay didn’t come with a revised launch date, leaving prospective customers and dealers alike in the dark.
The ID.7 was billed as a 2025 model, but as John Luciano said, the recent delay will likely push the electric liftback’s launch back at least one model year. This might turn out to be either very good for business, or another nail in the ID.7’s U.S. coffin. If VW rethinks its pricing and features strategy, it could be a winner.
If the car is just being delayed to wait out the perceived EV adoption slowdown and then launched as-is, it will already be a two-year-old model, albeit a very comfortable one, as we found out during our Euro review of it.",Iulian Dnistran
"More Fisker Layoffs Reportedly Hit Software, Design, Content Teams",https://insideevs.com/news/721469/fisker-layoffs-may-2024/,"The extent of the layoffs at the embattled EV startup is not currently known, but they come just after another recent wave of cuts.",2024-05-29 18:10:47,"The problems facing embattled EV startup Fisker have only mounted as the year has gone on, with the automaker seeing an indefinite end to production of its Ocean crossover, the closure of its California headquarters and multiple rounds of layoffs. More job cuts happened today as well, according to multiple social media postings and former employees.
Fisker In Trouble
The EV startup, helmed by designer Henrik Fisker, aimed to outsource car production to external partners while focusing on software, design, customer service and more. But the company has struggled with delivering cars, high-profile repair and quality issues, its sales model and cash flow. Fisker has recently warned it faces the possibility of bankruptcy.
An undetermined number of Fisker employees reported losing their jobs today on LinkedIn, Reddit and other platforms. Those now-former employees worked in multiple departments, including design, social media, content, software, digital products and service. Many say they were notified via email this morning. Three former Fisker employees who have spoken to InsideEVs in the past confirmed that they heard of today's cuts from their old co-workers.
A Fisker spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the reports, saying the company ""[does not] comment on internal employee matters.""

Fisker has instituted several rounds of job cuts this year as its future looks increasingly in doubt. Last week, Business Insider reported that the company was eliminating positions with the goal of going down to only a ""mission critical"" staff; it is unclear whether today's reported layoffs were part of the same round as those, or are part of some different process.
While the EV startup world is immensely challenging, Fisker has faced particular headwinds since last year.
The company's Ocean crossover—styled by namesake CEO and co-founder Henrik Fisker, who also penned the BMW Z8 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage—initially debuted to promising reviews. Built in Austria by contract auto factory Magna Steyr, the Ocean was meant to be the first of several electric Fisker models produced by outside partners, ostensibly freeing the company up to focus on software, design and the overall customer experience.
But Fisker ran into multiple challenges in 2023 alone, including struggles to get cars delivered to customers, quality issues, accounting problems, complaints about customer service, cash burn and more. In late April, the company announced it could seek bankruptcy protection within the next month, but that outcome hasn't yet come to pass.
Meanwhile, Magna Steyr has halted production of the Ocean, and owners who bought a once-$70,000 EV have been left with countless questions about their resale values and long-term support.

Geely Is The First Chinese Automaker To Crack The Top 10 Global Auto Sales Chart,https://insideevs.com/news/721079/geely-top-10-biggest-global-automakers-sales-q1-2024/,The Geely Group passed the Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW in Q1 2024.,2024-05-27 15:00:49,"Legacy automakers, analysts and outspoken CEOs alike have been warning about the threat of Chinese-made electric vehicles for quite some time. More to the point, both the United States and the European Union plan to increase the import duties on Chinese EVs, which may affect even the American Tesla Model 3.
Even though everybody seems to be talking about these EVs and the companies behind them, we’ve never seen them on the global top 10 list of best-sellers. Until now, that is.
China is moving fast on EVs
Buoyed by massive state incentives, China's electric vehicle industry is taking the world by storm, one way or another. After buying up countless legacy automakers in Europe over the last decade, China's automakers are now setting their sights on conquering the global top 10 sales chart.
In the first quarter of 2024, the Geely Group–known formally as Zhejiang Geely Holding Group–sold 730,000 vehicles globally, making it the first Chinese carmaker to enter the global top 10 sales chart for the January to March period, according to Nikkei Asia.

Geely, which owns several established names such as Volvo and Lotus, as well as other self-made brands like Polestar and Zeekr, overtook Germany’s Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW to secure the 10th spot on the list with its sales volume increasing 27% year-over-year. In the first quarter of last year, Geely was in 12th place globally.
Toyota Motor topped the global sales chart in Q1 2024 by selling 2.52 million vehicles (5% down year-over-year), followed by Volkswagen Group with 2.1 million cars (up 3%) and Hyundai Motor Group with 1.76 million vehicles (down 2%).
Other Chinese companies are also catching up. Even though Q1 included the extended Lunar New Year holiday, which usually means stores are closed and sales are slow, BYD, Changan Automobile, Chery Automobile and SAIC Motor all secured a place in the global top 20 sales chart. Together, the five Chinese players saw their combined sales volume increase more than 20% year-over-year while the overall sales growth for the top 20 automakers was just 2%.
The Lotus Eletre (top left), Volvo EX30 (top right) and Polestar 2 (bottom) are all made by companies owned by Geely.
Volvo, which is part of the Geely Group, had its sales increase by 12%, while BYD recorded a 13% uptick. The main driver for these numbers was exports, Nikkei Asia wrote, pouring more fuel on the fire that was billed by the West as “the threat of Chinese EVs.” Geely saw its overseas sales rise by 43% in Q1, while BYD recorded a massive increase of 150%.
In the whole of 2023, China exported 1.2 million so-called new energy vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids and full-on EVs), a 78% increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, experts estimate that China will see its battery-powered vehicle exports rise to 3.5 million next year.",Iulian Dnistran
‘Tesla Is Not A Family Business': New York Official Blasts Musk’s Pay Package,https://insideevs.com/news/720808/nyc-comptroller-brad-lander-tesla-shareholder-vote/,A June shareholder vote will decide how much control Elon Musk wields over Tesla. NYC Comptroller Brad Lander has something to say about it.,2024-05-24 11:30:27,"The drama at Tesla appears to be unending. Following a disappointing first quarter of sales, mass layoffs, a major safety recall of the Cybertruck and concerns over the company's apparent pivot to robotaxis, another big flashpoint has been lingering for the Austin-headquartered company: CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion payday.
In January, the Delaware Court of Chancery revoked a pay package for Musk originally approved in 2018. “The approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed,” the post-trial opinion read. Tesla's board is now requesting investors to vote again in favor of Musk at the annual general meeting on June 13, along with several other proposals.
Elon Musk seeks larger control over Tesla.
He wants to control 25% of Tesla, up from the 20.5% stake that he currently has. This, he says, would help the company solve autonomy and pivot towards artificial intelligence and robotaxis, eventually leading to ""transformative growth."" Some shareholders aren't buying this narrative. They want Tesla's board to be more independent, and the brand to continue focusing on EVs.
Musk has said that if he does not get a package that comes with a large amount of corporate voting power, he may undertake AI and robotics projects ""outside of Tesla""—a move many longtime $TSLA shareholders fear could tank the share price.
However, some shareholders are fiercely opposing this compensation plan, arguing that Tesla’s board of directors lacks sufficient independence and that Musk is not fully focused on the company.
The coalition opposing Musk's pay package includes the Comptroller of the City of New York, several NYC pension funds, and seven investment firms. New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander, an independently elected official who oversees the city's public pension funds and their investments in companies including Tesla, wrote an official letter urging his peers to vote against Musk's pay package.
He also called upon shareholders to vote against the reelection of Musk’s younger brother Kimbal Musk and former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, on the board of directors.
“We're not saying [Musk] doesn't deserve anything. He deserves a fair pay package, but it needs to be negotiated by a meaningfully independent board,” Lander told InsideEVs in an interview this week.
The Delaware court said that the plan was the largest pay package ever for the CEO of a public company, some 250 times larger than the average and over 33 times larger than the plan’s closest comparison, which was Musk’s prior compensation plan.
“The board is not providing independent governance on behalf of the shareholders, simply reflecting the point of view of the CEO and his family members,” Lander said. “If you want to have a family business, have a family business, and don't do an IPO. If you want to be publicly traded, then the rules apply here,” he added.
It's key to note that Lander's opinion, while shared by many Tesla shareholders and even critics, is far from the prevailing one. Many retail investors have indicated they will vote for Musk's compensation plan. Meanwhile, the company has ""pulled out all the stops"" to get the package approved, including advertisements, statements from its board chair and online drives.
In recent months, Musk has veered Tesla away from things like vehicle product development and new consumer models to focus more on advancing and proliferating its Full Self-Driving system.
He believes that for the company to achieve transformative growth, it needs to solve self-driving while pivoting towards artificial intelligence and robotaxis. But this group of shareholders isn’t swayed by this approach.
“We need Tesla to succeed as an EV car company,” Lander said. “That is an important part of the energy transition that we need both from an economic point of view and a climate point of view.”
There’s little to contest the fact that Tesla is already successful. The Model Y was the world’s best-selling car in 2023, eclipsing the Toyota Corolla, a historical bestseller. Tesla’s market valuation, hovering around some $544 billion at the time of publication, is viewed more as a technology company rather than a car company.
But its stock has been volatile, sales are tumbling and Musk frequently engages in political and culture wars online. Combine all of this with a lack of succession plans and an executive bench that's now far less deep than it was at the end of last year, and there’s a big question mark over the company’s future.
“When that same CEO is distracted by work at many other companies and other communications and political activities that bring discord, even amongst your own customer base, that's not a good recipe for the long-term thriving of the company,” Lander said.
Lander’s letter correctly points out that one of the reasons for approving such a substantial pay package in 2018 was to retain Musk and ensure his focus on Tesla’s success for a ten-year term. However, this has not been the case, as his other business commitments have only expanded during that time.
Meanwhile, Tesla is going all guns blazing to persuade investors to approve Musk’s massive pay package. Apart from aggressive ads and social media campaigns, it has even hired a “strategic advisor” to help with the task at hand.
All said, the outcome of the June 13 shareholder vote will be pivotal. Whether investors will prioritize Musk’s vision for AI and robotics or heed the call for stronger governance and a return to core EV manufacturing remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the stakes for Tesla’s future have never been higher.

The Kia EV3 Won’t Replace The Niro EV,https://insideevs.com/news/720576/kia-ev3-not-replacing-niro-ev/,"Although the Niro is slightly larger than the EV3, it has a smaller battery than the newly introduced subcompact crossover.",2024-05-23 08:37:13,"With the international launch of the all-new Kia EV3 subcompact electric crossover, the South Korean automaker is aiming for a new slice of the market–that of the affordable EV.
But Kia already has the Niro EV in that segment, with the souped-up hatchback having secured its place on the “most affordable new EVs on the market” lists over the years. So what will happen now that two models from the same manufacturer will compete for the same loaf of bread? In short, nothing, as Kia explained during its tech talk before the official reveal of the EV3.
New EV3 or older Niro EV?
The all-new Kia EV3 is the South Korean automaker's smallest model based on its modular E-GMP platform. As a result, it boasts all the latest tech that can be crammed into an entry-level model, including all the possible efficiency improvements. By contrast, the older Niro EV, which is just a few inches longer than the EV3, is still going strong on Kia's old combustion platform that was adapted for plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains.
The South Korean automaker said there will be a place for both the Niro and EV3 because customers who choose the Niro typically go for the hybrid instead of the all-electric version, paving the way for the EV3 to get a bigger cut.
More Kia Stories
“We will continue to sell Niro EV together with the EV3 because each market has different tastes or customer preferences,” said Spencer Chou, Head of Kia’s Global Business Planning. “In the meantime, the Niro has a hybrid model and we expect that [customers] will choose the Niro hybrid model rather than EV.”
In other words, Kia expects hardcore EV enthusiasts to buy the new EV3 when it arrives in the United States later this year, while the Niro hybrid will continue to target customers who prefer the safety net of a gas tank.
Kia EV3 subcompact electric crossover
2024 Kia Niro EV compact crossover
However, that begs the question: why keep the Niro EV in the lineup? Kia has never disclosed sales of both the electrified and all-electric Niro in the U.S. in its reports, so it’s hard to gauge how many units have been shifted. One report from last year claimed that the fully electric Niro has amassed a little over 200,000 sales globally since its introduction in 2018. Still, no details about U.S. sales of the fully electric version were offered. Nor have any sales figures been provided for the hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions.
Size-wise, the current Niro EV is roughly 5 inches longer and has a wheelbase that’s bigger by almost 2 inches compared to the EV3. The Niro is also 1 inch narrower and has a battery capacity of 64.8 kilowatt-hours, whereas the shiny new EV3 boasts an 81.4-kWh pack, although we assume that this figure is for the long-range version and that a smaller pack will also be offered.
In the pricing department, the Niro EV starts at $40,925 (including $1,325 destination), while the Niro Plug-In Hybrid has a base MSRP of $35,715. The cheapest electrified Niro, the hybrid, is even more affordable, starting at $28,265.
Meanwhile, the EV3 is expected to carry a price tag of around $35,000 to $45,000, making it slightly more affordable than the Niro EV. However, this pricing strategy is not official yet, so we’ll have to wait and see how Kia positions its new entry-level electric crossover.
Until that happens, let us know in the comments below which you would choose: EV3 or Niro EV.",Iulian Dnistran
Forget Chinese EVs. Biden’s Tariffs Will Hit The Cheapest Tesla Model 3.,https://insideevs.com/news/720126/tesla-model-3-tariff-batteries/,"A higher tariff on EV battery imports will make Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3 RWD, more expensive to produce. Other EVs may be affected too.",2024-05-17 15:31:15,"Of all the hefty tariffs against Chinese goods that President Joe Biden’s administration announced this week, the 100% tax on electric vehicles has gotten the most buzz. That the White House felt the need to effectively double the price of any Chinese EV coming to U.S. shores underscores just how vulnerable the world’s automakers are right now.
But other parts of Biden’s anti-China trade agenda will have a more significant and immediate impact on the U.S. EV landscape. Case in point: A higher tariff on EV battery imports will make Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3 RWD, more expensive to produce.
Biden's tariffs hit back hard at China
New 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs are meant to protect automakers operating in the U.S. from being undercut by competition whose prices they can't match. But they could also make EVs that use Chinese batteries much more expensive.
Tesla makes the U.S.-spec $38,990 Model 3 RWD in California using battery cells from CATL, one of China’s biggest producers of EV batteries. Biden’s new tariffs will raise the tax on imported Chinese EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%.
Tesla will need to either eat the higher costs, find a new battery supplier or deprioritize the entry-level Model 3, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. But he said consumers are unlikely to feel the pain of these higher costs in an era of slackening EV demand. Manufacturers are having trouble selling EVs at their current prices, so price hikes aren’t a winning strategy, he said.
“They need to get these vehicles sold,” Fiorani said. “And until a balance is made between supply and demand, there's very little upward pressure on pricing.”
Aside from the Polestar 2 and the upcoming Volvo EX30, there are no Chinese-made electric cars for sale in the U.S. So quadrupling the existing tariff on them is a largely symbolic move, some experts say. It may be more about shoring up the Democratic vote in manufacturing hubs like Michigan and Ohio than it is about Chinese cars, although the U.S. government would dispute that. Still, some EVs with China-sourced batteries or battery components could get hit here as well, whenever these price increases actually go into effect.
Thanks to lavish government subsidies for the EV industry and years of intense R&D and internal competition, China has become a battery-manufacturing titan. It’s also a global leader in the refining of raw materials like lithium and graphite, which are critical to batteries. It’s particularly dominant in the production of EV batteries that use a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistry. Those batteries offer less range and slower charging speeds than cells with other makeups, but are cheaper. They’re widely seen as key to bringing down the cost of electric cars, which remain more expensive than conventional cars in the U.S. Tesla uses LFP batteries in the Model 3 RWD.
“It's safe to say there's no EV being put on the market anywhere in the world that isn't dependent in some way on materials processing and manufacturing that's taking place in China,” said Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College and the author of Charged: A History of Batteries and Lessons for a Clean Energy Future.
The Biden Administration has made it a priority to build up domestic battery manufacturing and disentangle the U.S. auto sector from Chinese supply chains. Hence the beefed-up 25% tariffs on Chinese batteries and critical minerals announced on Tuesday. Additionally, the longstanding $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases was revamped through the Inflation Reduction Act and now only applies to cars made in North America without any Chinese battery components. When that provision kicked in in January, the Model 3 RWD was booted from eligibility, along with some other vehicles.
It’s not immediately clear if any other U.S.-made EVs would be vulnerable to battery tariffs like the Model 3 RWD is. It may be the only one. The Model 3 Long Range has significant Chinese content (40% of its value, according to U.S. government records) and doesn’t qualify for the EV tax credit. However, the independent Tesla researcher Troy Teslike tells InsideEVs that its batteries are made in South Korea with Chinese components.
Ford has said that it would introduce LFP batteries to the F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but those don't seem to be in production yet. The truck is still eligible for the full EV tax credit, indicating it doesn’t contain Chinese battery components. Ford plans to start domestic production of LFP batteries (using licensed CATL technology) by 2026. Until then, it would have to source them from China. Ford didn’t respond to questions about all of this.
(Update Saturday, May 18: After publication, a Ford spokesperson confirmed the company has since canceled plans for an LFP-powered F-150 Lightning. ""We continue to look at multiple chemistries for the long-term. We remain committed to LFP however we no longer plan to introduce LFP on Lightning due to previously announced updates to our production plans."")
There are some other U.S.-market EVs that contain Chinese batteries, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the all-wheel-drive variant of the Toyota bZ4X. But since those vehicles are assembled in Mexico and Japan, respectively, they aren’t subjected to the tariffs, a U.S. Office of the Trade Representative official told InsideEVs. (In other words, if a Chinese battery pack is already in a car when it arrives in the U.S., it’s not taxed independently of that vehicle.) The U.S. is looking closely at those kinds of vehicles, as well as the potential for Chinese companies to circumvent the tariffs by setting up factories in Mexico, the official said.
The taxes on batteries and minerals may be more consequential than the Chinese car tariff in the short term. Still, experts polled by InsideEVs did not believe that the tariffs on batteries and minerals would have a lasting impact on the prices EV buyers see.
Any automaker selling EVs in the U.S. is likely working to make its cars eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports. That would involve backing away from Chinese content anyway, regardless of any tariffs.
Batteries and raw materials may become more expensive for U.S. battery and car manufacturers, said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, an EV advocacy group. But that would only result in short-term price increases for cars, she said.
“We expect to see prices stabilize as the domestic supply chain is built out,” Malmgren said.

Polestar Depends On China For Now. It Wants 'More Clarity' On What EV Tariffs Mean,https://insideevs.com/news/720054/polestar-clarity-us-tariffs-says/,"The brand is ""currently evaluating"" 100% EV tariff increases from the Biden Administration, including the impact on Polestar 2 prices.",2024-05-17 09:35:29,"President Joe Biden’s announcement of new 100% tariffs that target potential Chinese EV imports and battery production has made ripples internationally. In theory, the tariffs are meant to fend off an impending swarm of EV imports from China and stop the country from completely dominating the EV battery supply chain. Yet, they could have some unintended consequences for brands that already exist in the United States.
While in Madrid for the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 international launch, Biden officially brought the hammer down on the tariff right in the middle of the Sino-Swedish brand’s most important debut of its future models.
Polestar Is Intertwined with Geely
Recently, Polestar became even more intertwined with Chinese automaker Geely. As of February 2024, the Geely owns 72% of Polestar. The remaining 18% is controlled by Volvo.
I had a quick conversation with CEO Thomas Ingenlath to find out just how the brand plans to deal with this, but things aren’t exactly clear for anyone right now.
“All effects that come now, we have to analyze and see what works, and what doesn’t work,"" Ingenlath said. ""We need more clarity, and ultimately we [need to know] what are actually the rules.""
Indeed, the entire auto industry seems totally caught off guard by the tariff announcement. At an event in Detroit this week, General Motors President Mark Reuss said the automaker was also still studying the immediate effects of the new rules, including their potential impact on future battery partnerships.
Right now, Polestar in particular feels fairly vulnerable to all sides of the tariff. True, some of the brand’s efforts are less impacted than others; when the Polestar 3 enters production it will be built in South Carolina, so it won't feel those effects.
Similarly, the U.S. versions of the Polestar 4 won’t come from the Hangzhou, China plant, but actually, a new plant in South Korea (formerly a Renault-Samsung factory) that should be operational before the end of the year.
But that doesn’t mean Polestar is out of the woods yet.
Both the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 use batteries made by Chinese battery provider CATL. Import tariffs on those batteries went from 7.5% to 25%, potentially adding thousands of dollars to the vehicle’s build cost.
Even worse off is the Polestar 2 sedan. All of them are made in China, meaning it is now subject to an import tariff that is now four times as high as it was before. When directly asked if pricing would change on the Polestar 3 and 4 after the tariffs, Polestar’s representatives said the brand had no plans on altering things from what was announced a few weeks ago.
So as far as we know, the Polestar 4 will continue to start at $54,300 before destination fees, and the Polestar 3’s pre-destination fee price of $73,400 will continue to hold true for the foreseeable future.
There’s no word on how long the brand will take it on the chin for the Polestar 2, though. Given the company’s not-so-strong stock price and slow sales performance, it is really in a vulnerable place here. It’s volume-selling, the entry-level model is now shaping up to be a catastrophic money loser.
In a similar vein, while I was in China, Geely’s Vice President Ruiping Wang said that one of her biggest goals is to continue to streamline the brands Geely has control over, through the use of more shared parts, streamlined development, and common platforms.
When asked, Ingenlath said this was a positive move, and said that Polestar’s continued access to the Geely toolbox would be an asset for the company.
However, given that Geely’s toolbox means that Polestar would be pulling more from China-made and China-designed assets, how exactly would Polestar outmaneuver the ire of the tariffs that could come with using more Geely parts? It’s not at all clear, there are no perfect clean solutions yet.
Still, Polestar officials remains seemingly optimistic, even if they're wagging a finger at the Biden Administration’s decision.
“As a global company headquartered in Sweden, listed on NASDAQ in New York, and operating across 27 markets, we believe that free trade is essential to speed up the transition to more sustainable mobility through increased EV adoption,"" a company spokesperson said via email. ""Production of Polestar 3 is set to begin in South Carolina in the summer, diversifying our manufacturing footprint and supporting job creation and economic growth in the region. This important SUV for us will be built in the USA for U.S. and Canadian customers as well as for export to European markets.""
We won’t know exactly how these tariffs will shake out, until they shake out.

"As It Launches An Affordable EV, General Motors Wants 'A Level Playing Field' With China",https://insideevs.com/news/719750/gm-electric-china-tariffs/,"GM President Mark Reuss weighs in on Biden's tariffs on China, the Equinox EV, hybrids and more.",2024-05-15 18:39:36,"Even the executives at General Motors will admit that when it comes to the electric vehicle arms race, Chevrolet hasn't really been in the game.
Its top-selling EV last year, the Chevrolet Bolt, carried the bulk of the entire company's all-electric sales despite being largely unprofitable and discontinued in December. Meanwhile, more modern EVs on GM's new Ultium platform faced quality issues, delays getting to market and repeated customer disappointments.
GM gets real with EVs in 2024
GM officials have said the bulk of the software and battery issues that plagued its EV lineup in 2023 are behind them. But now, it's bringing new EVs to market at a time when sales aren't as red-hot as they once were. Will new tariffs at least eliminate the immediate threat of Chinese EVs?
That's all supposed to change soon as GM launches its first affordable modern EV, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which offers up to 319 miles of range and should cost around $35,000 after tax credits. Then an even more affordable LT variant will debut later this year that should push the price tag into the high-$20,000 range after tax credits.
With demand for affordable EVs at its highest-ever level, GM expects the Equinox EV to be a hit. And at least for now, it won't have to compete against the threat of a flood of cheaper competitors from China, thanks to the Biden Administration's recently announced 100% tariffs on EVs from that country.
""We just want a level playing field,"" GM President Mark Reuss told InsideEVs at the Equinox EV's launch event near Detroit this week. He said the fear is that competitors from China could come into the U.S. market not to seek profits necessarily, but to kneecap the local market.
""There are strategies where folks will get into a price war and not make money, but try to price things out of markets,"" Reuss said. ""It's not even [China's] supply chain, it's their pricing strategy. We just want a level playing field to be able to price and make a profit and deliver value to our customers.""
The Biden Administration's new tariffs quadruple those already in effect on Chinese vehicles and are designed to assuage fears that the country's rising automakers could arrive in the U.S. with vastly lower prices than car companies here are prepared to deal with. A similar situation is happening right now in Europe, where local stalwarts like Volkswagen are quickly losing ground to new competition from China. In response, the European Union is examining similar penalties against Chinese EVs.
At the same time, critics have said that without the threat of competition from China's auto industry—which accelerated rapidly amid copious government subsidies and a laser focus on battery technology and software—automakers that operate in America could be given license to slow-walk the electric transition. Or worse, abandon it entirely.
GM too has been accused of walking back some of its promises on that front. The leadership of its luxury division Cadillac recently said the brand will make internal combustion cars past the previously stated end date of 2030. And at the launch of the Equinox EV this week, GM officials have stressed the need to ""let customers make the choice"" while it has ""feet in both camps."" Indeed, recent social media posts have led at least some followers to question GM's overall commitment to EVs.
Still, GM is moving ahead on several all-electric models this year, including the Equinox EV, Silverado EV and Cadillac Optiq. The automaker is also rolling out more home energy solutions, including battery storage and equipment that allows cars like the Silverado EV to power entire homes.
""We're playing in the heart of the market,"" Reuss said of the Equinox EV. ""For me, it's really, really important to get a vehicle at that price point into the hands of everybody, and it just hasn't quite been done yet.""
Reuss declined to elaborate on whether he saw GM competing with an automaker like BYD in the immediate term. ""We already do in China,"" he said. ""Here in Michigan, I don't know. But we aren't going to price our way out of business to win. What we are going to do is offer great vehicles, a brand experience and a customer experience that's hard to match.""
With the ink on Biden's tariff announcement barely dry, Reuss said he was unsure of the potential impact on who GM might partner with for less expensive lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries or on potential retaliatory tariffs from China itself. There, GM has a fine line to walk; though its market share in China has declined in recent years, the country remains an incredibly important source of sales and revenue.
Meanwhile, GM recently reversed course on a decision not to develop and sell hybrid cars, particularly after their surprise success in 2023 with buyers not ready to go fully electric. GM sells a number of plug-in hybrid models in China right now.
Reuss said similar technology could be deployed on U.S. market cars, but those cars won't be imported from China.
""That's our tech,"" he said. ""We know how to do it, and we're going to do a few. I can't tell you what yet, but [they] wouldn't be imported.""

"Mercedes-Benz Cancels Next-Gen Platform For EQS, EQE EVs: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/719738/mercedes-benz-cancels-next-large-ev-platform-eqs-eqe-report/,Poor sales of the current generation of top-spec EVs prompted the German automaker to cut back on investments.,2024-05-15 10:30:34,"Mercedes-Benz has reportedly canceled the next-generation platform designed specifically for the successors of the EQS and EQE due to the poor sales of the current-gen models, German publication Handelsblatt reported, quoted by Autocar.
The new platform, dubbed MB.EA Large, was supposed to be launched in 2028. Its cancelation will save Mercedes-Benz an estimated $4.3 billion to $6.5 billion in development and retooling costs, according to four insiders with knowledge of the matter.
Mercedes-Benz tracks back on EV investments
After delaying its goal of having a 50% sales share of electrified vehicles from 2025 to 2030 and rolling back the introduction of an all-electric portfolio by 2030 ""in markets where the conditions allow,"" Mercedes-Benz has reportedly canceled the all-new platform that was supposed to underpin the next generations of the EQE and EQS sedans.
Last year, Mercedes-Benz sold a total of 43,202 EVs in the United States, a healthy increase of 248% compared to 2022. However, the number is far from impressive. Rivian, which is still very much a startup, beat the Germans by delivering a little over 50,000 EVs last year (this includes the commercial vehicle segment).

Furthermore, the first quarter of this year brought a 4.5% decline in U.S.-market sales for Mercedes-Benz compared to the same period last year, resulting in only 8,336 units.
The MB.EA Large platform was one of two MB.EA platforms, the other one being MB.EA Medium, which is still in development and will be used for the next-gen EQC sedan and SUV. Or C-Class with EQ Technology, as the company recently changed its naming structure for battery-powered cars.
That said, the successors of the current EQS and EQE EVs, including sedans and SUVs, are still very much on the table, albeit on an upgraded version of the EVA2 platform that’s currently being used for the company’s flagship EVs.
According to Autocar, the 400-volt charging architecture will be upgraded to an 800V system on the upcoming EQE and EQS. The battery cells will also offer more energy compared to the current models, and the electric motors will be swapped for more efficient units.
Other Mercedes-Benz platforms that are still in development include the MMA platform, designed for both electric and combustion compact models like the CLA, GLA and GLB, MB.AMG for sports cars and MB.Van for commercial vehicles.
The latest change in the German company’s electric vehicle plans comes after postponing its target of achieving a 50% share of electrified cars from 2025 and 2030. Mercedes-Benz also rolled back plans to sell only EVs by 2030 in certain markets.",Iulian Dnistran
Tesla Sent Its Interns Packing. Now General Motors Is Going After Them,https://insideevs.com/news/718992/gm-is-recruiting-laid-off-tesla-interns/,A GM recruiter is encouraging software grads to apply for a summer internship at GM.,2024-05-08 14:30:54,"Tesla’s largest-ever job cuts have impacted an estimated 20,000 employees worldwide. Among this global talent pool, many are interns. Just as they began what they thought was a promising opportunity in a burgeoning electric vehicle industry, they were dismissed. Now, General Motors hopes to seize the opportunity by nurturing them under its umbrella.
Former Apple Recruiting Manager and GM's current Talent Sourcing Strategist Laura Del Amo posted on LinkedIn that the Detroit automaker was keen to provide laid-off Tesla interns an opportunity within GM’s software teams. The post was spotted and first reported by Business Insider.
Tesla's biggest-ever layoffs.
After years of rapid growth, Tesla has hit a roadblock. Its Q1 2024 sales were down, messaging around the future affordable EV is muddled, and some 20,000 Tesla employees worldwide have lost their jobs. Some of the laid-off staff now might find roles at rival brands.
“In light of recent industry news, GM is extending an invite to software students who may have been impacted from the changes in Tesla’s upcoming summer internship cohort,” Del Amo wrote on the social media platform. “We believe in the strength of our automotive community and are keen to integrate diverse talents into our team. If you are now looking for a new internship opportunity, let's connect,” she added.
Del Amo did not respond to a DM on LinkedIn and GM did not reply to InsideEVs request for comment at the time of publication. We will update this post if we hear back.
Since the post went live Monday, dozens of fresh software grads have expressed interest in the comments. These include several master’s and PhD students specializing in computer science, computer engineering, data analytics and other related fields.
Hiring former Tesla interns might be a new thing. But GM has a history of hiring former Tesla executives. Kurt Kelty, who previously served as Tesla's senior director of battery technology, has taken on the role of vice president of battery operations at GM. Additionally, the company recently appointed Jens Peter Clausen as its new head of manufacturing. Clausen is the former vice president of Gigafactory Nevada.
Internship program aside, several other departments at Tesla have been rattled by the recent layoffs. That includes engineering, production, marketing, design and human resources among others. More importantly, the dismissal of Tesla’s entire Supercharger team sent shockwaves across the industry last week. It was the same team that helped build America’s most comprehensive and reliable charging network, driving sales of EVs.

Republican Bill To End EV Tax Credits Gets Almost No Support From Carmaking States,https://insideevs.com/news/718806/gop-tax-credit-bill-wyoming/,A new Senate bill would end the federal EV tax credit. Not signing on: states that actually manufacture cars.,2024-05-07 12:00:37,"It's truly a shame that electric vehicles are getting caught up in our endless culture wars, because they don't have to be. EVs represent a new type of technology, that's all. But thanks to their outsize popularity in coastal blue states and federal tax incentives introduced to support their adoption, they've become extremely polarizing in America. Now, a new U.S. Senate bill seeks to end those tax credits entirely.
The bill has support from several GOP colleagues of the original sponsor, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming. Not joining in support of Barasso's bill: any states that actually manufacture electric cars. I wonder why that is?
The EV tax credit war
Tax credits have long been used to incentivize the purchase of hybrid and electric vehicles, both in the U.S. and abroad. But that often makes them a political target, even though in recent years they are helping to drive more local EV manufacturing as well.
Barasso's bill, called the Eliminating Lavish Incentives to Electric (ELITE) Vehicles Act, would eviscerate every American incentive driving EV adoption over the past 18 months. It would repeal the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, end federal incentives for DC fast chargers, end any tax credits for used EVs and close the ""leasing loophole"" that applies to that tax credit even if the car is not manufactured in North America. That loophole has driven significant EV leasing growth, including from brands like Hyundai and Kia.
“The electric vehicle tax credit benefits the wealthiest of Americans and costs hardworking American taxpayers billions of dollars,” Barrasso said in a statement. “Working families in Wyoming shouldn’t be footing the bill for the luxuries of Biden’s climate elitists. The federal government has no business pushing Americans into expensive electric cars they don’t want or can’t afford.""
Put aside, for a moment, the idea that these tax credits do make EVs more affordable and may make people want to buy them more—which has clearly been the case. Instead, let's take a look at who is co-sponsoring Barasso's bill:
Co-sponsors of this legislation include U.S. Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Steve Daines, (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and John Thune (R-S.D.).
Besides all of them being members of Biden's opposition party, you may notice that none of those states are hosts to any electric vehicle manufacturing. In fact, with the sole exception of Missouri, Kansas, and Indiana, none of the co-sponsor states even make cars at all.
Granted, some of those states are home to various supplier companies or even engine manufacturing plants. But no cars, period, are built in Wyoming. Or Arkansas. Or Montana. Or Florida. Or South Dakota. You get the idea.
Note that the bill's co-sponsors don't include any senators from Texas, where Tesla's Austin Gigafactory lives; or Tennessee, home to Volkswagen's ID.4 (and soon, Nissan EVs as well); or South Carolina, home to BMW in the U.S.; or Alabama, where Mercedes' electric SUVs are built. And all of those are conservative, red states with Republican senators.
That's the problem with Barrasso's bill: it fails to take into account how the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits actually incentivize EV production in the U.S. and North America. After all, if automakers don't build here, they won't get the tax credit—which puts them at a competitive disadvantage against those that do. It's no wonder that leaders from automaking states don't want EV tax credits to end; the EV industry is adding hundreds of thousands of new American manufacturing jobs that depend on people actually buying the cars.
Moreover, Barrasso and several of his co-sponsor colleagues go heavy on the anti-China fearmongering, saying the tax credits are funneling money to a geopolitical adversary. But while it's true that China maintains tight control over the battery supply chain for now, that's changing rapidly as companies scale up North American battery manufacturing and sourcing operations—again, to feed demand for locally built EVs.
Barrasso's bill is extremely unlikely to pass, let alone get to President Joe Biden's desk. But looking into who sponsors it and who doesn't gives you a good sense of just how serious it's supposed to be.

"Even More Tesla Layoffs Are Underway; Design, Engineering, HR Impacted",https://insideevs.com/news/718636/even-more-tesla-layoffs-may/,The automaker is still on the chopping block and it’s unclear when these layoffs will end.,2024-05-06 11:48:32,"It’s not over yet. After a tumultuous week marred by hundreds of dismissals within Tesla’s Supercharger team—the same team that helped build North America’s largest and most reliable charging network—it seems like that the automaker's relentless layoffs are continuing into this week.
During the weekend, several Tesla employees appeared to have been laid off, as reported by workers on LinkedIn and various social media platforms. Employees from design and engineering teams, product managers, and human resources, among others, shared on social media that they received notifications of the layoffs via email over the weekend, with many being informed on Sunday.
Were you impacted by Tesla's layoffs?
If you were impacted by Tesla's layoffs, or have information to share, contact the author suvrat.kothari@insideevs.com from a safe, non-work device. We are happy to speak anonymously and securely.
The now-former employees also shared screenshots of the emails they received from Tesla, revealing the sudden nature of these layoffs. They were terminated with immediate effect, losing access to Tesla systems and physical facilities on the same day they received the emails. Some of these individuals are still awaiting details regarding severance packages, continuation of benefits, and separation documents.
In April, Tesla announced that it would lay off ""more than 10%"" of its global workforce. Concurrently, several high-ranking executives departed from the company. Just a week later, The Information revealed that the company planned to dismiss nearly its entire Supercharger team—the very team instrumental in establishing the gold standard for charging infrastructure in North America.
The layoffs follow the company's growing focus on robotaxis and artificial intelligence. Workers interviewed by InsideEVs expressed concerns that the Supercharger layoffs, in particular, could impact the quality and reliability of the network—a network relied upon by millions of Tesla users and soon to be accessible to EV owners from other brands as well.

"American Culture Wars, Chinese Imports: Why Australia's EV Market Is So Fascinating",https://insideevs.com/news/718504/australia-ev-market-overview-2024/,"Electric utes when, though?",2024-05-05 13:00:00,"Australia isn't one of the biggest markets in the world for electric vehicles, but it is one of the most interesting. With a small population, long-standing love of petrol-guzzling highway cruisers and close proximity to China, it's a nation that in some ways lags behind the rest of the world in EV adoption, and in other ways… also lags. But it's trying its best.
Like a lot of other things about the country, the Australian EV market is a melting pot, featuring cars and trends you’d recognize from all over the world—from American-style culture wars to discount Chinese imports—thrown together in the most chaotic way possible, with governments scrambling to adapt to changes in the market and buyers reluctant to trade in their big dual cab utes.
The electric vehicle market in Australia is booming. Well, kind of. Electric car sales saw a 161% increase in 2023 compared to 2022’s numbers, which taken as a percentage alone is a huge leap. In terms of the actual number of cars finding new homes, it constituted a jump from 33,000 EVs sold in 2022 to 87,000 in 2023, which are small numbers no matter the market (especially when you consider over 1.2 million cars were sold in Australia in total last year). To paint a bigger picture, despite these recent upswings in sales, electric cars currently make up just 1% of the total passenger fleet in Australia.
Still, a leap is a leap (8% of all car sales in 2023 were EVs, up to 10% in early 2024, which is progress—and higher than the U.S. already), and it’s a sign that after years of pricing buyers out of the market, thanks in part to a restrictive luxury vehicle tax that unfairly targeted the high battery costs of an EV, some recent tax concessions, combined with more affordable models making their way to showrooms, are finally convincing more and more Aussies to make the switch to electric cars.
Tesla’s brand awareness has also played a part here but other manufacturers—Kia, Hyundai, BYD, MG, BMW, Volvo and Polestar—are making strides as well. After years of supply woes during the pandemic, where Australia was a low priority for many companies, rival cars are now arriving in volume, and with enough variety that consumers now have a genuine choice, across manufacturers and categories, when it comes to buying an EV.
Early estimates show that EV sales in Australia for 2024 should comfortably pass the 100,000 mark, which would be another huge increase from 2023. The continued popularity of home solar installations is also helping here, as is a slow-burning change in public opinion, which put electric cars on the frontlines of the culture wars in 2019 when then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the opposition Labor Party’s attempts at formulating an EV policy for the ICE-dominated market–which he incorrectly believed would replace Australia’s beloved dual cab utes and SUVs with much smaller vehicles unable to “tow your trailer” or “get you out to your favorite camping spot with your family”—an attempt to “end the weekend,"" as they said.
But significant challenges remain if mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is to come anywhere near the targets some governments are setting, like the Australian Capital Territory’s goal of phasing out all consumer internal combustion car sales by 2035, which is a much stricter objective than the Biden administration’s call for EV sales to make up 50% of the American market by 2030.
The single biggest issue facing the Australian EV market, more than any hesitation over price or cultural opposition, is infrastructure. Specifically, the lack of it. There simply aren’t enough public (or private) charging stations to facilitate the widescale adoption of electric cars, there aren’t enough being built, and the chargers Australia does have are often too slow, unreliable or both.
This affects all Australians, regardless of where or how they live. For an increasing number of inner-city apartment dwellers, where building owners are reluctant (despite some recent government attempts) to invest in chargers, tenants are being locked out of one of the great financial incentives of owning an EV: saving money on fuel. For regional Australians–or anyone traveling regionally, something we’ll get to soon–a scarcity of highway chargers makes traveling long distances between towns a perilous prospect.
And for suburban homeowners, well… actually, they’re doing just fine. Indeed contrary to a lot of stereotypes about electric car owners in Australia—that they’re usually confined to the wealthy inner suburbs of our biggest cities—the biggest contributors to EV growth in the country are actually suburbanites, who are taking advantage of home solar to slash the costs of their daily commute.
Charging also affects many Australians (or at least many Australians yet to purchase an EV) on a psychological basis, with continued concerns over range and charging times on long road trips. Like the US, Australia is a large, car-dependent nation, where people regularly travel huge distances for work, holidays and visiting family.
Anyone making these trips in an ICE vehicle wouldn’t think twice about range, because there are petrol stations all across the nation’s highways and towns. But highway charging stations here are still few and far between, many are slow (50kwh and under), and the newer stations that are operational are often plagued with reliability issues and long queues on popular travel dates. (Again, sound familiar?)
It’s one thing telling prospective EV owners that their regular interstate drives might take 20-30 minutes longer while they wait for a charge. It’s another to tell them there might be lines keeping them there for an hour or more during holidays (when they’re most likely to be traveling!), and that’s if the machines are even working in the first place.
This is less of a concern for Tesla owners, of course, because like in many other markets the company has scores of proprietary charging stations all across Australia. And last year Tesla began the process of opening some of these up to owners of non-Tesla vehicles, albeit at a premium price. (Nearly all electric vehicles in Australia, Tesla or otherwise, employ a standard CCS2 port, making this cooperation much easier than somewhere like the US where an adapter is currently required.)
But Australia can’t rely on Tesla chargers alone to pick up the slack; if governments are truly interested in seeing more and more people make the switch to an electric vehicle, there needs to be a greater commitment to providing the infrastructure—whether through incentives or direct management of the rollout–that switch requires.
In the least surprising news possible, it’s Tesla that dominates the Australian EV market. As the first EV company to take Australia seriously, and the first to really establish a presence here–both with showrooms and charging stations–it’s been able to build up a market lead that dwarfs that of its competitors.
Tesla sold over 45,000 cars in Australia last year, with sales of just two models (the Model Y and Model 3) accounting for 53% of all electric car sales in the country. That’s a colossal presence in a fledgling market, but it actually constitutes a slide from 58% of all EV sales in 2022, as more and more companies enter the market at scale and chip away at Tesla’s total share.
Outside of Tesla, some of the more traditional manufacturers enjoying sales success in Australia in 2023 included Kia with the EV6, Volvo with both the XC40 Recharge and C40, and Mercedes-Benz with the EQA. The Polestar 2 (disclaimer, I own one) also sold in (relatively) healthy numbers.
The biggest splash in the Australian market last year, though, was made by discount (at least by EV standards) Chinese companies, particularly BYD and MG, who count Australia as one of their few (current) Western markets thanks to a lack of heavy tariffs like those imposed by the U.S. Despite the low-rent branding–which has led to corporate intervention—Australian buyers fell in love with the low-cost BYD Atto 3, which ended 2023 as the country’s third biggest-selling EV. Right behind it was MG’s MG4, which finished fourth despite only going on sale halfway through the year.
New vehicles from BYD like the Seal (March 2024’s fourth best-selling EV) and Dolphin (in sixth place) should further cement the company’s presence in Australia. And as Kia, Hyundai, Polestar, Volvo, BMW (and more) ramp up their own product offerings, and Volkswagen belatedly brings the ID range down under, Australians are increasingly getting the opportunity to really shop around for an EV.
While I’ve already listed a number of infrastructure and pricing roadblocks to EV adoption, there are also some cultural barriers to overcome. Australia is, after all, a nation whose automotive heritage is inexorably linked with the big petrol engines of the Ford v Holden era.
While those days are all but over, as it’s been almost a decade since the end of local manufacturing of the Commodore and Falcon, Australia is still a country obsessed with petrol-guzzling family cars. We’ve just replaced the sedans of old with the giant pickups of the 21st century.
Australia’s three top-selling cars for 2023 were all big utes. The Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux and Isuzu D-Max sold 155,000 cars combined, which constituted 12.7% of the total Australian car market. And while it’s a lazy stereotype to suggest these are also the same buyers who would scoff at the very idea of driving an electric car, there’s a practical side to these sales numbers: the Australian workers and families buying these big cars don’t have much choice in the market, whether they want an EV equivalent or not, because there simply aren’t any electrified versions of those best-sellers available.
Toyota EPU Pickup Truck Concept
Rivian doesn’t sell cars in Australia, there’s no sign of Ford’s F-150 Lightning, BYD’s pickup is still TBD and while Toyota has unveiled an electrified ute concept, and Isuzu an electric D-Max, it could be years until they hit the market.
While Australia’s road to EV adoption has been a rocky one so far, there’s a chance at a brighter future ahead, provided governments can take necessary action that goes beyond individual states offering (and in some cases now pulling) inconsistent purchasing incentives.
Manufacturers are doing what they can, as electric cars arrive in greater numbers and more affordable pricing than ever before, but until buyers are confident that there’s a robust infrastructure around the nation to support them wherever they’re used to driving—and electric versions of the types of cars most popular in the local market become available—many Aussies will remain understandably reluctant to make the switch.

Clad in a white Tesla-branded cap and a gray Nike t-shirt and sitting in his Model Y, Nico Murillo recalled his experience. The 29-year-old had been working at Tesla for five years. He started as a Production Associate in 2019 and was promoted to a Lead Production Associate and then a Production Supervisor.
At 4:30 a.m. on April 15, Murillo said he opened his laptop to a deactivated account. He thought it was an IT problem and got ready for work anyway. He then started his 90-minute commute to work, during which he usually checked his emails and listened to podcasts. He said he was able to check emails thanks to the Model Y’s Autopilot. (Note: This is not advisable; Autopilot and Full-Self Driving are driver assistance systems that require constant supervision and readiness to take control at all times.)
As he sifted through emails, he came across a message from Tesla, which read: ""Unfortunately as a result, your position has been eliminated by this restructuring."" His manager confirmed the same for him. He reached the factory at 5:50 a.m. and tried to badge in. That’s when a security guard walked up to him, told him he was part of the layoffs and took his badge away. “I sat in my car in disbelief,” Murillo said.
Murillo seems to have sacrificed a lot for Tesla. Because the commute from home was so long, he sometimes slept in his Model Y on workdays in the factory lot. The demanding 13-hour shifts left him with little energy to return home, leading him to camp in his car, shower at the factory and microwave dinner in the break room. Now he’s out.
What’s next for him? He says the cost of living in California is exorbitant, which is why he will sell his house and furniture and begin living in his car. The video above is worth watching in full because it captures the essence and impact of Tesla’s layoffs and how they have uprooted the lives of so many employees.

Tesla Axing Its Supercharger Team Puts The Entire Industry In The Dark,https://insideevs.com/news/718025/tesla-charging-layoffs-2024/,"Most of Tesla's Supercharger team was caught up in recent layoffs, leading to countless questions about the future of EV charging.",2024-04-30 13:13:44,"Even if you're a die-hard, paying-blue-check, all-in-on-$TSLA, Elon-can-do-no-wrong superfan, it's awfully hard to find a silver lining around the news that most—if not all—of Tesla's Supercharging team was caught up in the company's latest round of layoffs.
Last night, The Information reported that roughly 500 people in Tesla's charging division are being cut from the company, including its senior director and head of new products. A quick perusal of LinkedIn, Reddit, X and other social media platforms shows scores of people who worked on the charging team at Tesla announcing their layoffs. All of them seem utterly (and understandably) stunned that they had to. (Emails and direct messages to several current and former Tesla officials have gone unanswered.)

Moreover, Musk's own memo to the troops doesn't provide much information or reassurance about the future of charging. “We will continue to build out some new Supercharger locations, where critical, and finish those currently under construction,” Musk wrote, almost with the same level of interest as when he spoke of future Tesla models during last week's Q1 earnings call.
Astoundingly, the rest of the auto industry that was getting ready to partner with Tesla on charging seems blindsided as well today, leaving them with countless questions about what's next. ""We were surprised as anyone, and have no additional information than what’s been reported,"" one automaker official told me.
There's no two ways about it: this move is utterly baffling. And to one degree or another, it may throw a lot of future plans for both Tesla and the American EV industry into turmoil.
In recent months and weeks, we've seen Musk seemingly lose interest in Tesla's position as the singular leader (Chinese automakers excepted) in the electric vehicle arms race. Artificial intelligence and autonomy have his full attention now as he stakes the company's future on robotaxis, seemingly only confirming ""more affordable"" new models out of investor pressure.
But if Tesla is walking back its Supercharger growth plans—and cutting the team behind them seems to indicate that—it's an entirely new level of weird for Tesla.
You could make a strong argument that building out its proprietary charging network is the smartest thing Tesla ever did. Way back in 2012, when the Model S was just starting to emerge, Tesla realized that widespread adoption of its products would never happen unless it stepped outside the auto industry's traditional lane—i.e., letting other companies handle ""fueling""—and built the charging infrastructure itself. It then quickly scaled its charging network across the country and the world, learning much along the way. The Supercharger network became one of the biggest networks anywhere and the gold standard for how charging itself should work.
Doing everything in-house at Tesla was once a necessity for operating in an industry that had little to no support for EVs. It quickly turned into a key strength, allowing the company to control the entire car ownership experience from top to bottom—including charging. Today, Tesla Supercharging is seamless, easy to use and ubiquitous. Almost every other EV driver has looked with envy at Tesla drivers charging their cars without a care in the world, all while they fought with the credit card reader at an EVGo station or the like.
The Supercharger network even paid dividends for the entire concept of electric vehicles. Tesla showed that it could be done; that a huge, reliable and fast network of chargers could be built and that range anxiety could be made a thing of the past. In many ways, building out that charging network was the best thing Tesla has ever done.
It was no wonder that rival automakers spent much of 2023 announcing they would switch to Tesla's proprietary North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug and allow access to the Supercharger network. That's been widely seen as a win-win for all involved; Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Rivian and the rest get access to the best charging network around, and Tesla would gain an estimated $20 billion in charging revenue alone by 2030. Not to mention, of course, billions more from the Biden Administration's investments in EV charging grants.
By Tesla's own accounting, it grew Supercharger stations by 26% year-over-year by Q1's end and owned some 30% of America's DC fast-charging infrastructure. EV owners were excited to get their NACS adapters and eventually easier native charging. Competitors like ChargePoint were offering the same plugs too, and Tesla seemed poised to rake in cash. Just last week, The Atlantic even likened Tesla to some kind of new Con Edison, less an automaker and more an energy provider.
As Jay-Z once put it, ""It was all good just a week ago."" But when it comes to Tesla and Musk, a lot can happen in a week.
Emails to other automakers from InsideEVs have not received responses yet, and nor have messages seeking comment to Tesla's communications teams in other parts of the world.
It's possible that Musk saw that the Supercharger ecosystem somehow wasn't growing quickly enough for his tastes; Bloomberg recently noted that Tesla didn't hit its target of tripling the network between 2021 and 2023. (It merely doubled it instead!) Perhaps Musk wants a new team that can get it done sooner. Then again, who? Christmas just came early for every automaker looking to hire top-tier charging talent.
What's more likely is the obvious: that this is all part of Tesla's wholesale pivot to AI and robotaxis. That, in Musk's mind, those areas are where Tesla will put the most resources and talent until it has fully ""solved"" the challenge of autonomous driving. For countless reasons, that pivot seems suspect, and the idea that Tesla's past success will guarantee its future has its limits.
In the meantime, losing a 500-person team responsible for charging probably isn't great for Tesla owners. Questions arise about maintenance, upkeep and new features, to say nothing of new station rollouts.
It's also very unlikely that these layoffs will impact the industry-wide pivot to the NACS plug. That's becoming an SAE standard, so it's effectively out of Tesla's hands. One industry official who spoke to me indicated the move could slow other automakers' moves to the actual Supercharger network, however, but it's still unclear how.
In the end, the only person who can articulate the path forward is Musk. He spent the past 12 hours on X posting about slavery, woke TV shows and declining birth rates, so what happens next is anyone's guess. But slowing the growth of one of the best reasons to buy an electric car isn't good for anyone—not the industry, and certainly not the planet.
Musk seems more focused on Tesla's stock price as of late. Unfortunately for him, even investors don't like this move. Tesla stock is down 5% as of publication, a sign that even Wall Street is baffled by gutting such a key part of the company's empire.

"Honda Will Spend $11B To Build EVs, Battery Packs In Canada",https://insideevs.com/news/717521/honda-investment-canada-evs/,"Honda has been building cars in Canada since the 1980s, but now it wants to go electric and have a complete local supply chain.",2024-04-25 17:00:32,"Today, Honda confirmed plans to expand its manufacturing presence in Canada to build electric vehicles. The Japanese automaker announced a massive $11 billion investment—the largest single automotive investment in Canada’s history—that will lead to the creation of new plants near its existing manufacturing campus in Alliston, Ontario, with the goal of beginning EV production in 2027.
The investment will see the construction of four new manufacturing plants: one for EVs, one for battery packs and two plants that will manufacture battery components. Honda intends to create a complete local EV supply chain that will help it build EVs at a competitive price and with a lower environmental impact (it wants to only build EVs and FCEVs after 2040 with the ultimate goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050).
Honda is lagging behind other manufacturers
While other automakers already have entire parallel lineups of bespoke electric cars, Honda only sells two EVs of which only one is of its own making, the e:NY1.
The new EV assembly plant has a projected output of 240,000 vehicles per year, while the battery plant will be able to produce 36 gigawatt-hours of EV batteries annually. Between all four new factories, Honda says it will add 1,000 new jobs on top of the 4,200 people it already employs.
Honda currently builds the CR-V and Civic in Canada, and it will add at least two new models by 2028.
There is no word yet on what vehicles will roll out of the new factory, but Automotive News quotes an industry analyst who believes that the first will be a small Honda-badged electric crossover expected to debut in 2027, followed one year later by a larger Acura electric crossover.
Unlike today’s Honda Prologue, which is built for Honda by General Motors on its own Ultium architecture, these new models will be underpinned by a new bespoke EV architecture that will debut in 2025.
More Honda EV News
Honda showcased what its new line of EVs will look like with a series of concepts that debuted in January. The one that will serve as direct inspiration for a production model is the Saloon, which looks a lot like a small handheld vacuum cleaner—a Dustbuster—and it will spawn a production EV called the Honda 0.
This will be Honda’s first “next-generation” EV, and its design will likely serve as the basis for future models, including the crossover that enters production in Ontario in 2027. Honda also wants to turn its Ohio manufacturing facilities in the US into an ""EV hub"" where it plans to start electric vehicle production in 2025.",Andrei Nedelea
Elon Musk Says Tesla Is An A.I. Company. He Should Let Someone Else Make The Cars,https://insideevs.com/news/717357/tesla-should-spin-off-car-business/,"Elon Musk clearly doesn't want to run a car company. So let him run ""Tesla"" as an AI company, and turn Tesla's car business into its own company.",2024-04-25 14:30:40,"Elon Musk insists that Tesla is an A.I. company. Never mind that the company makes almost all of its money selling cars, or that it sells more electric cars than any other company in the U.S. and that it currently produces the best-selling car in the world. It is not a car company, Musk insists. It's an A.I. company. Sure, fine, whatever. But if that's true, he ought to let someone else make the cars.
Because as its CEO has gotten increasingly bored of the car market, Tesla has started to slip in the car market. Its market share is declining. Its newest product is expensive, fraught with quality problems and late. It has had to cut prices again and again and again to improve demand for its core products. Its flagship sedan and SUV are built on a platform that debuted during Obama's first term. The Semi is still nowhere. The Roadster doesn't exist. The Model 2 might be dead.
No wonder Musk doesn't want Tesla to be valued as a car company.
He focuses his public comments, his product strategy and his earnings calls on Tesla's progress with A.I. He promises that Tesla will solve autonomy. The whole value of the company, he says, is contingent on Tesla's lead in A.I. and autonomous vehicles.
""If you value Tesla as just like an auto company[...] it's just the wrong framework. And if you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible. So, I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,"" Musk said on the earnings call.
Analysts are buying it. Morgan Stanley's Tesla Analyst Adam Jonas considered Tesla's ""auto business"" to account for just 20% of the stock's $310 per share value. Other firms have similar approaches. They see great potential in Tesla's A.I. business, from autonomous driving to building humanoid robots that can work factory jobs.
I do not believe that Tesla has demonstrated any leadership in solving autonomy or generalized A.I., except maybe running a not-autonomous driver assistance system and extremely limited hardware.
A render of the Model 2, which may have been canceled.
Regardless of how you assess its current position, though, Tesla has two exceedingly complicated problems to solve. The first is to maintain its dominant position as one of the world's most sophisticated, popular and profitable electric vehicle companies. The second is to wholly transform into an A.I. powerhouse with a fundamentally reshaped business model.
Both markets are important. But it's clear that Musk only cares about one. So why not spin the carmaking arm into a separate business, and let a true adult run that execution-oriented, capital-intensive business?
The truth is that long-term, long-game carmaking isn't built for Elon Musk. Selling millions of cars per year means accurately planning years out, something that just isn't in his skillset. It requires diligent work with regulators, slow, plodding investments in service and retention and constant tweaks to price and product strategy. It prioritizes slow improvement over rapid reinvention, for better and for worse.
It's Musk's worst nightmare. He has built an empire on rapid growth. Take an untapped market, exploit it first and outmaneuver competitors in an ever-changing landscape. Be whatever the shareholders want you to be. Use any model, piss off anyone as long as it keeps the stock going up. Forget steady profits. Sell infinite growth. A boundless horizon. Don't give people want, decide what they want and sell it to them.
It's a strong playbook for a startup. No meteoric stock gain is based on slow, consistent improvement, it's based on growth. This approach is perfect for an A.I. company that needs to be nimble, and Musk is right that he's probably the best to lead it. I don't want Elon Musk having the power to shape what the future of A.I. looks like, but I get why investors put money behind him. Do you really think anyone is going to get in his way?
The only person who consistently gets in Musk's way is Musk himself. The man's quick, gut-driven pivots don't seem to work out well when the business is mature. He's prodded every dial and button at X—nee Twitter— and the result is clear: The website that once defined the online conversation is now a cesspool of spam and bigotry. It's never had a worse relationship with its advertisers. And its CEO has never been so radioactive.
And yet America can't afford for the same fate to befall Tesla's auto-making efforts. The company is just too important. Very few other automakers right now offer such a compelling slate of EVs backed by Silicon Valley-grade software, a dealer-free buyer experience and an internally built, reliable charging network. Tesla is not just important to the EV market; it is important to the U.S.' strategic geopolitical position. It is the only large-scale EV manufacturer in the country that has global relevance, the chops to compete with Chinese EV manufacturers and an existing, satisfied EV customer base.
It doesn't need a disruptor in charge. It needs an executive. One who executes. Someone who can helm a complicated, large organization while retaining the institutional knowledge and talent to keep its edge over the competition. It doesn't need to solve autonomy to succeed.
It needs a suspension team that doesn't rotate through 20-somethings every six months, giving us no real clue whether the Model 3 Performance will outdrive an M3 (like the last one) or end up a total mess (like the Model S Plaid).
It does not need one big swing. It needs a million little decisions, made by a CEO that isn't distracted by SpaceX, X, Dojo, autonomy and anger over ""the woke mind virus.""
It needs its own leadership, its own organization, its own name. Call it The Car Company. Or X Auto. Or Bob, for all I care. Let Elon keep shipping cars with ""FSD Supervised,"" but have that be software licensed to X Auto by Tesla, the A.I. Company. That gives the A.I. division the name Elon wants, a guaranteed buyer for its flagship product, access to fleet learning data from X Auto and the ability to sell autonomous software and humanoid robots to whoever he damn-well pleases.
Meanwhile, The Car Company can focus on what really matters: Making cars that people want to buy. Redesigning the Model S. Switching the Model 3 over to an 800-volt architecture. Building out V4 Superchargers.
These projects all surely sound boring to Elon Musk. That's exactly why he shouldn't be in charge of them.

"Ford Will Build Profitable, Affordable Sub-$30,000 EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/717373/ford-q1-2024-earnings-takeaway/,"Ford isn't making money selling EVs, but it's learning that consumers want cheap EVs. Ford promises to deliver them.",2024-04-24 18:02:15,"Ford reported falling electric vehicle revenue on Wednesday, but executives seemed optimistic in the earnings call. CEO Jim Farley affirmed that what the market wants is affordable EVs, and Ford is well-positioned to offer them in the next generation of products. They'll be profitable, he promised, and in the meantime Ford is adding capacity for its well-established hybrids, like the F-150 PowerBoost and Maverick Hybrid.
It was an optimistic call for a brand that has struggled to woo investors. The company is one of the cheapest in the world when it comes to its share price versus its earnings, a sign that investors have little confidence in the core business. But Ford's deeply rooted fleet business is massive, its hybrid portfolio is solid and in-demand and its Mach-E EV is the second-best-selling EV SUV in America, behind the Tesla Model Y.
Ford's Revised EV Plan
Ford had to dial back its expectations for EV adoption. But the company thinks it is now on the right track, with a fleet of solid hybrid options and the popular Mustang Mach-E. The hard step will be not just selling EVs, but doing so profitably.
The Mach-E has seen a rapid sales increase since Ford cut prices by 17 percent. Farley said that affordability is the number one concern, as evidenced by that sales increase. He promised that the next generation of Ford EVs will be affordable and profitable. This focus comes as Tesla has reportedly lost interest in its rumored ""Model 2"" affordable EV, which may have been abandoned in favor of Musk's promised Robotaxi.
Either way, Ford says the Maverick, F-150, F-250 and Ranger are all selling fast, and that it is on track to build up a profitable EV business as the ICE business continues to generate cashflow. To keep the business relevant and reduce emissions, Farley says Ford will have hybrids in every segment. The trick is keeping prices under control as consumers fight higher interest rates, which make it far more expensive to borrow on expensive cars and trucks.
But again, Ford's goal is to have a strategic advantage in affordable EVs. General Motors is trying to make the same play with the Chevy Equinox EV, and Tesla with the Model Y. It's not clear who will win the race to offer a long-range EV that is affordable for young and less affluent buyers, but I'm happy that more companies are chasing that market.
""What's really exciting for us is we see an opening in the market,"" Farley said. ""We believe we can be profitable at $25,000 or $30,000.""

"Tesla Says New Vehicles, Including 'Affordable' Models, Are Coming. Musk Has Few Details (Updated)",https://insideevs.com/news/717203/tesla-q1-affordable-2025/,The automaker's eagerly anticipated Q1 filing has a few details about what's needed most: new models. Musk would rather talk robots instead.,2024-04-23 18:23:26,"[April 23, 6:07 PM Eastern: This story has been updated with details from Tesla's earnings call.]
Lately, it's been a fair question whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk remembers he's running a car company—or if he even wants to. Much to the chagrin of investors, owners and fans everywhere, word on the street lately is that Tesla's big focus is robots, AI and autonomously-driven robotaxis instead of a supposedly $25,000 EV. All of that comes at a time when Tesla's car lineup is older than ever, and losing ground to new electric competitors.
But Tesla's Q1 2024 financial report, which was released today ahead of its quarterly earnings call, seems to affirm that some new vehicles are indeed coming soon—including ""more affordable"" models.
Then again, the CEO himself had little to say about any of these models, preferring to opine about AI, the robotaxi service, the Optimus robot and autonomous driving instead.
""We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,"" the report said. ""These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.""
""So we expect it to be more like early 2025, if not late this year,"" Musk said on the earnings call. ""It's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently. And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity."" In 2023, Tesla produced about 1.8 million vehicles.
Beyond that, Musk didn't seem at all interested in elaborating on an actual product roadmap. At several points during Tuesday evening's call, he either demurred or waved off questions about what was coming next—including when one analyst asked if ""new products"" meant updates like the Highland Model 3, or entirely new cars.
Instead, Musk wanted to talk not about how Tesla is going to fend off Hyundai or Nissan, but how it's going to deploy a network of autonomous taxis under a service he likened to Airbnb or Uber.
""We should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,"" Musk told the analyst. ""If you value Tesla as as just like an auto company... it's just the wrong framework. And if you ask the wrong question, the right answer is impossible.""
Both Musk and today's report stop far short of what many investors and Tesla-watchers probably wanted: confirmation of that $25,000 EV, and maybe announcements of new crossovers and sedans to replace the aging Model S, X, Y and 3. (The Roadster is said to be in the cards as well, but like the Cybertruck before it, it has been long-delayed and is likely to be an expensive niche product.)
Earlier, the robotaxi—reportedly some kind of fully autonomous vehicle that Tesla will deploy in an unspecified new ""service""—was said to ride on the same next-generation platform as the more affordable compact car. But earlier this month Reuters reported that program had been canceled, something Musk later denied. Its current status is unclear, but industry observers believe that more affordable EVs will be key to wider adoption, and that Tesla is positioned to deliver on them first—that is, if competitors from China and even players like Kia and Ford don't beat Tesla to the punch.
Besides the Cybertruck, which launched to a more expensive price tag and less range than anticipated, most of Tesla's new models as of late have been updates of existing ones, like the upgraded Model 3. Earlier today, Tesla formally unveiled the Performance variant of that sedan. But entirely new models from the ground up are nowhere to be found, and that has investors and fans alike concerned about the company's ability to do battle with the competition.
It is possible that Musk will elaborate further on the upcoming models in tonight's earnings call. If that happens, we will update this story.

New York City’s Electric Rideshare Cars Surpass Two Million Trips In March,https://insideevs.com/news/717112/nyc-rideshare-evs-two-million-trips-march/,"In the first quarter of 2024, NYC saved some 731,000 gallons of gas thanks to electric rideshare cars.",2024-04-23 12:00:39,"If you’re a curious New York City resident or visitor, you’ve likely heard the faint hum of traction motors emanating from electric cars with Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) registration plates.
Mostly Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys, but also some Toyota bZ4xs and Polestar 2s among others, these EVs are everywhere in the five boroughs of the world's financial and cultural capital. They ferry customers in near-silence, leaving no trail of no planet-warming fumes. Nearly 25,000 all-electric and hybrid Uber, Lyft and other rideshare cars now ply in NYC and these drivers are going all guns blazing with usage rates.
NYC's massive undertaking to electrify yellow cabs.
To curb emissions from transportation, electrifying commercial fleets and rideshare/ride-hail cars is as important as making private cars go green. NYC is leading that charge with the largest fleet of rideshare cars in the country, which is now covering millions of EV trips monthly, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of planet-warming gas.
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission—the agency responsible for licensing and regulating yellow taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles—announced yesterday that rideshare EV trips surpassed two million in March alone. That’s double from a million trips covered in January.
This comes after the City of New York passed its Green Rides Initiative, mandating all new for-hire vehicles (FHV) to be electric from November 2023 onwards. The rules led to a sudden surge in FHV license applications, with NYC TLC's daily intake soaring from 150 to 2,000 applications overnight, a TLC spokesperson told InsideEVs early this year.
From an emissions perspective, these rules are reaping huge benefits. Since November, monthly EV trips increased fivefold, from 362,000 before.
EV trips in the first three months of the year have saved some 6,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, covering 25 million miles in zero emissions trips. That’s the equivalent of saving 731,000 gallons of gas, according to the NYC TLC. It’s also equivalent to “carbon sequestered by 107,000 tree seedlings for about 10 years.”
The Green Rides Initiative initially aimed to electrify five percent of the rideshare fleet in 2024, increasing to 15 percent in 2025. However, due to an overwhelming response from FHV drivers, NYC TLC attained that goal in January 2024, two years ahead of schedule—the current penetration of electric and wheelchair-accessible vehicle (WAV) trips stands at 17%.
When TLC passed the new rules in October 2023, thousands of drivers jumped at Teslas. But an InsideEVs investigation found that they were getting little charging support in return.
At one Tesla Supercharger in Brooklyn, drivers were waiting up to 90 minutes to recharge their EVs due to long lines and limited charging options with no parking fees. This left them frustrated, as some of them were losing up to two hours of business daily due to “traffic jams” at overcrowded charging stations.
Realizing the massive need to improve these drivers' charging experience, the TLC and the City of New York are slowly investing in charging infrastructure.
Recently, ride-hail startup Revel—which operates neon blue Teslas in the city—announced a project to build the largest fast-charging site by an airport in the U.S. It will be located at the LaGuardia airport in Queens. Google-backed charging start-up Gravity’s 500-kilowatt round-the-clock fast-charging site opened in February in Times Square—this one is the fastest charging station in the U.S.—InsideEVs tried it out recently.
The NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) also recently opened five new Level 3 chargers at the World’s Fair Marina parking lot, close to the Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens.

Tesla Sales Declines Put U.S. EV Registrations Into The Red For First Time Since 2020,https://insideevs.com/news/716952/new-us-ev-registrations-negative-february-2024-tesla/,"Without Tesla, which is the biggest player by far in the EV game, the numbers actually went up compared to last year.",2024-04-22 11:56:16,"Tesla makes or breaks the EV industry’s numbers–that’s a fact, whether you like it or not. When Tesla’s delivery and registration figures go up, the whole segment goes up. When Tesla sees a prominent dip in sales–as it did in the first quarter of this year–the U.S. EV sector goes down with it. This is how big Tesla’s influence is.
Take the month of February, the latest for which registration data is available, courtesy of S&P Global Mobility. According to Automotive News, Tesla’s new registrations went down a whopping 25% compared to the same month last year, making the entire EV segment’s new registrations in the U.S. drop 2.8%. The last time this happened was in August 2020, when Tesla’s U.S. registrations fell by 2% and the total new EV registrations dropped by 6%.
Can you have an EV market without Tesla?
If we were to take Tesla out of the equation, new EV registrations in the United States went up 32% in February, compared to the same month last year. With Tesla, the numbers went down 2.8%.
But can we have a modern EV industry without the company that basically invented the long-range, mass-market EV?
The negative numbers appeared despite the fact that every other EV maker in the country saw consistent gains in the second month of this year, including Rivian, Ford, Hyundai, Kia and BMW. Without Tesla, the EV sector in the U.S. actually went up a massive 32%. Keep in mind that these are registration numbers, not production or delivery stats, which are different.

But when looking at what volume Tesla is pushing, even during a weak quarter, it’s clear that without it, the EV landscape would be scarcer.
Ford’s new EV registrations went up 84% in February compared to the same period last year, with 7,656 cars registered. Hyundai’s registrations rose 54% and reached 3,822 cars. Kia saw an increase of 58% in registrations, hitting 3,722 units. BMW had a 166% increase to 3,559 registrations. Rivian had 3,251 new registrations in February, an increase of 56% compared to the year-earlier month.
The five aforementioned car companies had 22,010 combined new EV registrations in February, according to S&P Global Mobility, while Tesla alone had 36,697 new registrations. Total EV registrations amounted to 78,361 cars, making the electric vehicle share of the U.S. light-vehicle market drop to 6.2% from 7% in February 2023.
Tesla EVs at V4 Supercharging station. From left: Model 3, Model S, Cybertruck, Model X and Model Y
The main reason for Tesla’s–and the EV sector’s decline–in February was the poor performance of the Tesla Model 3 in terms of registrations. The company’s entry-level EV saw a decline of 73%, partly because of the model losing eligibility for the $7,500 tax credit at the beginning of the year and partly because the American EV maker introduced the refreshed version in the first quarter of this year–a move that was associated with a temporary production halt for retooling the Fremont Gigafactory.
The Model Y, which is by far the most popular EV in the United States, saw registration figures drop by 6.7% in February, reaching 28,664 units, while the Model 3 had just 4,423 new registrations. Registrations of the Model S went down 1.8% to 501 cars, while the Model X saw an increase of 47% to 2,537 units. The Model X and Model Y are eligible for the Federal Tax Credit for new EVs, while the Model 3 and Model S are not, according to Tesla’s website, which might explain the uptick in Model X registrations.",Iulian Dnistran
The Volkswagen ID.4 Will Soon Be A Union-Made EV,https://insideevs.com/news/716835/vw-tennessee-uaw-vote/,"The vote represents a major coup for the United Auto Workers, and means one of VW's most important cars will soon be union-made.",2024-04-20 10:48:50,"Of all the cars built at Volkswagen's Chattanooga Assembly Plant in Tennessee, it's not hard to argue that the Volkswagen ID.4 is the one most important to the automaker's future. It's VW's first modern all-electric model—a symbol of what's to come as it eventually moves away from gasoline, aimed squarely at the ultra-important U.S. market. And now, it will soon be a union-made EV as well.
Workers at VW's Tennessee plant ""overwhelmingly"" voted to join the United Auto Workers union this week, as Automotive News put it, with the ""yes"" camp scoring 73% of the vote. Volkswagen officials said 2,628 workers were in favor, with 985 against.
The UAW and the electric future
Starting with strikes on Detroit's Big Three last year, the UAW has sought to reverse decades of losses to its membership. The push comes at a time when many U.S. auto workers fear for their jobs, if a move to electric vehicles requires less manufacturing labor since the cars have so many fewer parts.
“We saw the big contract that UAW workers won at the Big Three and that got everybody talking,” Zachary Costello, a trainer in VW’s proficiency room, said in a statement released on the UAW's website. “You see the pay, the benefits, the rights UAW members have on the job, and you see how that would change your life. That’s why we voted overwhelmingly for the union. Once people see the difference a union makes, there’s no way to stop them.”
In a short statement, Volkswagen officials said: ""The vote was administered through a democratic, secret ballot vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board.  We will await certification of the results by the NLRB. Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.""
After the votes are certified, VW must begin negotiations with the workers for a contract at the plant.
As Costello noted, the VW workers' union vote comes on the heels of historic strikes against the Detroit Big Three last year, which resulted in record wage and benefit gains after years of decline following the Great Recession and bailouts. They were the product of a newly energized and rather militant UAW—a union infamous for corruption scandals, close ties to automakers and ineffectiveness—that is dead-set on reversing decades of membership losses. And in recent weeks alone, the union drive at VW Chattanooga had faced staunch opposition from Republican governors in the South, all of whom oppose unionization at the many car plants in their states.
The union vote was a groundbreaking one on multiple fronts.
It represents the first time a so-called ""foreign"" plant in the U.S. south voted to join the UAW, after years of similar campaigns failing. Two similar attempts to unionize at Chattanooga faltered in recent years. (Volkswagen's Westmoreland, Pennsylvania plant was a union shop, but it closed in 1988.) It also means that Volkswagen will be a union automaker much like it is in its home country of Germany. And, obviously, it is a major win for the UAW as it gains momentum to try and unionize at Mercedes-Benz soon and other automakers down the line, including possibly Tesla.
But even more so, the UAW vote in Tennessee could be seen as big news for electric vehicles, and American labor's role in making them.
Though UAW President Shawn Fain has been adamant that the union is not against EVs, many workers fear that the moves to more EV production—which generally requires less labor and fewer parts than combustion car production—will mean fewer U.S. manufacturing jobs. Indeed, that talking point has been used heavily by politicians who oppose regulations driving more EV adoption, including former President Donald Trump. And Volkswagen too hasn't shied away from the importance of its Chattanooga plant to the future of cars, with a battery engineering plant onsite and efforts to retrain its workforce to make EVs. Furthermore, the UAW has sought to unionize EV battery plants in the U.S. as well, which generally pay much less for hourly labor than union car plants do.
All of this has begged the question: will the electric future of cars in America be built by union labor, or not? And after Friday night's results, the answer is that it just might be.

"‘No Incentives For You,’ Mexico Tells Chinese Carmakers After U.S. Pressure",https://insideevs.com/news/716738/mexico-restricts-chinese-ev-investments/,A major win for U.S. automakers as Mexico halts all future meetings with Chinese carmakers and stops incentives for local factories.,2024-04-19 10:00:25,"The potential influx of cheap Chinese electric cars into the U.S. through Mexico had ruffled the feathers of American carmakers. This prompted U.S. officials to raise concerns to their Chinese counterparts about the country’s manufacturing overcapacity. They’ve also been urging Mexico to keep Chinese carmakers at bay—a measure to safeguard America’s massive homegrown car industry. The fruits of these diplomatic efforts have now led Mexico to align with the U.S. to fend off cheap Chinese EVs.
At a meeting with Chinese OEMs in January, Mexican officials said the country would refrain from granting incentives to Chinese automakers. They added that the country was suspending all future discussions with them, sources who preferred anonymity told Reuters. Mexican officials have not met any Chinese automakers since then. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) reportedly urged Mexico to restrict Chinese investments.
U.S.-China trade tensions affect the EV industry
China has emerged as the goliath in electric vehicle manufacturing, with much of its expertise in making top-quality and affordable EVs. As its manufacturing capacity grows, U.S. auto executives fear that cheap Chinese EVs will destroy the domestic American car market. But Mexico's alignment with U.S. policy should come as a major victory for U.S. OEMs.
A USTR official said that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) designed to foster free trade in North America wasn’t meant to be a loophole for Chinese automakers to exploit. The news comes after representatives from Mexico’s Economy and Foreign Relations ministries traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with U.S. officials for high-level talks. The USTR did not respond to InsideEVs request for comment at the time of publication.
About 20 Chinese carmakers are already present in Mexico, including BYD which sells models like the Dolphin Mini, Yuan Plus and Han EV among several others. But these are Chinese-made imports—the country’s carmakers have yet to build a plant there. BYD is now chasing state incentives to build a local factory, even if they’re substantially lower than federal funding, according to Reuters. States like Durango in the northwest and Nuevo Leon in the northeast among others are wide-ranging incentives to Chinese carmakers.
Nuevo Leon last December approved $153 million in incentives for a Tesla plant. Despite acquiring all the required permits towards the end of 2023, Tesla’s factory in Mexico has faced some delays—CEO Elon Musk attributed the delay to the integration of advanced manufacturing tech. But construction of the Mexico Gigafactory began in March, according to local news outlet Milenio, citing comments from Nuevo Leon Governor Samuel Garcia Sepulveda.
This should ease the pressure on U.S. automakers, as the possibility of Chinese automakers circumventing tariffs has likely diminished. But its repercussions on Mexico’s domestic market and the wider Latin America remains to be seen. However, countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile are also attractive destinations for Chinese automakers. They have welcomed them with open arms, with brands like Chery Auto already announcing a factory worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Argentina.
All said, with an industry-wide slowdown in demand for EVs and the urgency to bring affordable EVs to combat planet-warming emissions, Mexico restricting Chinese investment shouldn’t be a reason for American EV makers to let their guard down.

Affordable Kia EV3 Will Put Kia Ahead Of Countless Rivals: Exec,https://insideevs.com/news/716716/kia-affordable-evs-us/,And EV3 isn't all. Kia aims for eight electric models on sale in the U.S. by 2029 and establish itself as a leader in affordable EVs.,2024-04-19 08:39:42,"Kia has demonstrated that it can create winning electric vehicles like the EV6 GT and three-row EV9. But it also believes it's about to be ahead of rivals in making affordable EVs—the next great frontier for the electric world. Now, with the upcoming EV3 subcompact crossover and the EV4 sedan, Kia expects to see significantly increased EV adoption, an executive said in a recent interview.
According to Kia America COO Steve Center, who spoke with Automotive News, “We're ahead of most, and we're trying to rush out ahead because our technology will be more evolved. You can't just jump in and catch up. You have to have your own R&D, your own secret sauce.”
Kia's major EV push is underway
The Korean automaker wants to make ""EVs for all,"" and that includes many more models. In some ways, it's already there. The most affordable EV that Kia sells in the US is the Niro EV, which starts at under $40,000 before any rebates and incentives.
The production version of the EV3 crossover is expected to debut early this summer, and the EV4 should be revealed sometime after that. Automotive News also speculates the EV3 could be priced around $32,000 if it ends up coming to the U.S.—a price tag that very few modern electrics can match.
Bringing the cost of EVs down is a key concern for all automakers, but Kia wants to establish itself as a leader in affordable EVs with many of its upcoming models. Its main rival in this endeavor isn’t another established automaker or even Tesla, which reportedly shifted focus away from the development of its $25,000 EV, but Chinese giants like BYD, Geely and Nio, whose offerings are priced very keenly while offering comparable quality to EVs from the established players.
Chinese EVs have an almost insignificant presence in the US today, but many carmakers from China have plans to expand into the States like they’re already doing in parts of Europe. By the time they reach the US, though, Kia expects to have a big chunk of the EV market to itself, especially at the more affordable end of the market.
Center spoke about the $7,500 federal tax credit and noted that “when you look at the market, the [current] buyers are wealthier, and their incomes phase them out of the rebate if they buy [the vehicle]. But if they lease the car, which most of them do anyway, they get the rebate. When you're building affordable EVs in the U.S., the rebate will appeal more to households with less income.”
Kia has only announced plans to build one EV in the US, its most expensive electric offering, the EV9, which will roll off the assembly line at its factory in Buford, Georgia. It has not announced any official plans to build another EV there or open up a new production facility elsewhere in the country, but Center’s statement makes it sound like this is being considered so that its affordable EVs become even more attractive thanks to the significant federal rebate.

Volkswagen’s Upcoming Cheap EVs In China Will Use Xpeng Tech,https://insideevs.com/news/716562/vw-xpeng-electrical-architecture-evs-china/,Four entry-level EVs will debut in 2026 using Xpeng’s electronic architecture to slash costs by up to 40%.,2024-04-18 10:00:12,"The Volkswagen Group, which owns car brands like Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, wants to stay ahead of the pack in the world’s largest and most competitive electric car market, China.
Last year, the Volkswagen brand lost the top spot in the Chinese sales charts after a 15-year reign after being dethroned by BYD, so the German-based group that owns the maker of the Passat and ID.4 wants to regain some of that lost momentum with help from local player Xpeng.
VW goes on the offensive in China with help from local players
Volkswagen had a bit of a rough time last year in China when it came to sales. The German car brand lost the top spot in the charts after ruling them for over 15 years, so something had to change.
To try and make things better (and cheaper), VW will launch four cheap EVs in China with help from local player Xpeng.
The partnership between the two companies will result in four affordable Volkswagen-branded battery-powered cars engineered specifically for the Chinese market that will utilize Xpeng’s know-how in electric and electronic architectures. Think advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) and over-the-air updates.

According to the German group, the new zonal E/E architecture bearing the name China Electrical Architecture (CEA) will be jointly developed by Xpeng, Volkswagen China Technology Company (VCTC) and CARIAD China.
This is different from the running gear architecture that integrates things like the traction battery and motors. In China, the upcoming affordable EVs made in collaboration with Xpeng will be based on the so-called China Main Platform (CMP), which–rather confusingly–is being developed in collaboration with the SAIC Volkswagen and FAW Volkswagen joint ventures.
The biggest benefit of Xpeng’s involvement in VW’s upcoming electric cars will be a significant reduction in costs. The German company said that it’s expecting a 40% drop in costs compared to the current MEB platform thanks to the reduced complexity and lower number of control units that come with the adoption of Xpeng’s E/E tech.
Besides the four entry EVs that will debut in 2026, the new China Electrical Architecture will also be embedded in two mid-range Volkswagen EVs that are jointly developed with Xpeng, the first of which will be an SUV. Just like their cheaper siblings, these more upmarket models will also hit the Chinese market in two years.
""Competition is very fierce, and we have to adapt our cost structure to be competitive in this environment,"" Volkswagen Group board member and China chief Ralf Brandstaetter said for Reuters.
Last year, the Volkswagen Group acquired a 4.99% stake in Xpeng for approximately $700 million in a bid to fast-track the development of the aforementioned pair of mid-size electric models.",Iulian Dnistran
The Three-Row Toyota Highlander Is Going Electric: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/716570/toyota-highlander-ev-headed-to-the-us/,There's also a bZ3x electric crossover in the pipeline for launch in 2026.,2024-04-18 07:58:04,"Despite the pressing urgency posed by climate change, Toyota has been slow to embrace electric vehicles. In the process, environment groups have labeled it a “laggard.” But even Toyota must know it can't keep that up forever, and so things are reportedly changing—including turning the popular Highlander crossover into an all-electric model.
That comes to us from veteran automotive journalist Paul Eisenstein, writing for CarBuzz. In the report, the outlet says Toyota not only plans to convert the Highlander to an EV-only model but that same EV will spawn into a posh Lexus version. Toyota has already filed trademark applications for the names TZ450e and TZ550e with the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
Toyota dragged its feet with EVs
The world's largest carmaker by sales volumes is immensely influential when it comes to policy decisions. Citing things like EPA's initial regulations were ""bad for the country"" and vowing to not ""back down,"" Toyota's lobbyists held their own and got what they wanted—a slower transition to EVs, but at a cost to the environment.
We are reaching out to Toyota for comment and will update this story if we get one.
This move makes sense, because Toyota sold some 169,543 Highlanders in 2023, making it its second-best-selling SUV in the U.S. after the RAV4. The Highlander’s Q1 2024 sales are down 40%, but if Toyota can spice up the model with a punchy electric powertrain, enough range and a fresh design, some of the Highlander’s loyal customer base might consider making the switch—a win-win for all.
Meanwhile, Toyota won’t desert its gas and hybrid car customer base. CarBuzz added that the Grand Highlander would continue with an internal combustion engine, likely with hybrid and plug-in hybrid options. This should bode well with the Japanese automaker’s multi-pronged approach to electrification, which includes selling conventional hybrids, EVs, PHEVs and FCEVs concurrently.
Toyota currently only offers two EVs in the U.S., the lackluster bZ4x crossover and its cousin, the Lexus RZ450e—they’re the same underneath but wear different clothes.
The brand staunchly opposed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) initial emissions proposal, which aimed at aggressive EV adoption through stringent emissions targets. But after fierce lobbying, Toyota got what it wanted: loosened emissions rules that allow a more gradual adoption of EVs.
But in 2021, Toyota announced 30 new BEVs to be launched worldwide by 2020. Most concepts showcased back then carried the “bz” nameplate, an abbreviation for “beyond zero.” The following number denotes vehicle class and x denotes all-wheel drive. That’s how you get the rather confusing bZ4x nameplate.
One of the concepts Toyota showcased in 2021 was labeled the “bZ Large SUV,” a three-row family SUV riding on a dedicated BEV platform to be manufactured at the brand’s Georgetown, Kentucky plant from 2026 onwards. It was rumored to get the production name of bZ5x, although CarBuzz reported Toyota wouldn’t adopt the alphanumeric nomenclature for all models.
That’s not all. A compact electric crossover, expected to be named the bZ3x, and a compact sedan are apparently coming in 2026 as well, sources familiar with the matter told the news outlet. We suspect that the electric crossover would be the production version of the bZ compact SUV concept that Toyota showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show in 2022. A similar Lexus version would land in the U.S. by 2027, the report stated.
The Toyota bZ3 sedan, built by a joint venture between FAW and Toyota, is already on sale in China.
All things considered, retaining the Highlander nameplate is a significant decision. And the rationale behind that seems straightforward. The bZ4x's underwhelming 252-mile range and maximum fast charging speed of 150 kilowatts, far below many rivals, have failed to impress. Moreover, its unappealing alphanumeric name isn’t helping either. Consumer reception to the bZ4x has been lukewarm, with Toyota selling only about 1,897 units in Q1 2024.
However, the Highlander is a household name in the U.S., and that raises an important question. Should Toyota abandon its alphanumeric nomenclature entirely and rely on established names for its future EVs? Should it also bring the Tundra and Tacoma under the EV umbrella in the future? Leave your thoughts in the comments.

Jeep's Electric SUVs Could Get Gas Engines After All,https://www.motor1.com/news/716367/jeep-wagoneer-s-recon-gasoline-engines/,The Wagoneer S and Recon EVs could be joined by ICE models to bolster sales.,2024-12-25 07:30:11,"From 973,227 vehicles sold in 2018 to 643,000 units in 2023–that's quite the downfall for Jeep. It's suffered five consecutive years of decline. Axing the affordable Renegade and Cherokee certainly didn't help, but new CEO Antonio Filosa has a plan. The Wagoneer S and Recon are coming as electric SUVs. In addition, gasoline versions are apparently being considered as well.
Speaking with Automotive News, Jeep's boss admitted the two future electric SUVs might be joined by conventionally powered derivatives. This would be possible thanks to the STLA Large platform that has already underpinned the new Dodge Charger. It's an EV-centric architecture that can accommodate ICEs as well. The next-generation Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio are getting this hardware, too.
Jeep's head honcho told Automotive News that should opportunities arise for ICE versions, ""we need to grab them or somebody else will."" Since the EV market seems to be cooling down, selling these two models with gas engines at a presumably lower price seems like a no-brainer. It would make sense especially considering the company’s new goal is to achieve one million annual sales in the United States.
Even with gas derivatives of the Wagoneer S and Recon, hitting 1M still seems like an overly ambitious goal at this point. Cheaper vehicles to indirectly replace the Renegade and Cherokee would help bolster volume. Europe's Jeep Avenger might be a solution in the US but it wasn't mentioned during the interview.
Meanwhile, the 600-horsepower Wagoneer S is scheduled to go on sale in the third quarter of the year for a short 2024MY run. With a 0 to 60 mph in less than three and a half seconds, it'll be Jeep quickest vehicle ever. It's getting about 400 miles of range and all-wheel drive with a dual-motor setup. The firm's boss says the large electric SUV can lure in Tesla buyers who ""want something more sophisticated.""
The smaller Recon is coming by year's end and will have its first full year on sale in 2025. Other than the STLA Large platform, technical specifications have not been disclosed, but it should be smaller than the Wagoneer S. Filosa projects Wrangler customers interested in electrified off-roaders will want the Recon.

The EV Industry Has A Battery Oversupply Problem,https://insideevs.com/news/716392/ev-industry-battery-oversuplly/,"That sounds bad, but it should result in cheaper batteries for everything from cars to stationary storage.",2024-04-17 12:00:20,"Last year, demand for lithium-ion batteries that went into electric vehicles and stationary storage amounted to roughly 950 gigawatt-hours globally, according to estimates from BloombergNEF. At the same time, the total battery manufacturing capacity was almost triple, at about 2,600 GWh.
At the end of next year, the total global announced battery manufacturing capacity is said to be 7,900 GWh or 7.9 terawatt-hours, while demand projections squeeze out a figure of 1.6 TWh, according to the same source. In other words, we’re looking at a supply chain that could churn out five times more lithium-ion batteries than needed for EVs and storage applications. So what now?
EV demand didn't quite keep up with supply
Battery makers around the world churned out about almost times more cells than were needed for EVs and stationary storage last year. That discrepancy is expected to get even bigger in the following years as battery companies continue to invest heavily in R&D.
Well, for starters, it’s worth noting that the announced battery manufacturing capacity will most likely never be reached. Bloomberg writes that much of it will be either behind schedule or canceled. That’s because some battery manufacturers will simply be squeezed out of business by the big players and other parts of the supply chain won’t be able to deliver at such a high pace.

However, the fact of the matter is that the world’s battery makers will continue to increase their production capacity as time goes on to keep up with the expected demand for EVs and stationary storage. This is because multiple nations across the world, including the United States and the European Union’s members, have imposed gradual carbon dioxide emission reductions for passenger cars, which can be reached by increasing the share of battery- or hydrogen-powered vehicles.
China is the global leader in battery manufacturing, whether we like it or not, and it will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Two of the world’s biggest players, CATL and BYD, continue to invest billions in research and development, coming up with new and better products.
Europe, North America and Asia (except China) are also set to increase their battery manufacturing capacity in the next two years.
Polestar 5 prototype battery module featuring StoreDot XFC cells
All of this might seem intimidating but it all boils down to the benefits for the end users. And the biggest benefit of them all is that the price of EV batteries will continue to go down, enabling carmakers to introduce more affordable cars.
Last year, the average price for lithium-ion battery packs went down 14% compared to 2022, reaching $141/kWh for the electric bus, commercial EV, passenger EV and stationary storage segments, according to BloombergNEF. In 2019, the average was $258/kWh.
By the end of 2024, China’s CATL expects to bring the cost of lithium-ion battery cells down to less than $60/kWh. That’s less than half of last year’s average.
China already has its fair share of cheap, no-frills EVs that can be had for the equivalent of $10,000 to $15,000. In the United States, we’re not quite there yet, but upcoming models like the entry-level Chevrolet Equinox EV, VinFast VF3 and Kia EV3 are sure to lower the entry point for EVs in America.

"Tesla Engineers, Technicians, Sales Staff, Recruiters Hit By Layoffs In U.S. And China",https://insideevs.com/news/716270/tesla-engineers-sales-staff-laid-off/,"Hundreds of job cuts have already taken place in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas.",2024-04-16 10:30:27,"It has been a tumultuous year for Tesla so far, and for Tesla, that's really saying something.
The world’s most highly valued car company and the largest battery electric vehicle manufacturer saw its sales plummet in the first quarter, followed by a major reshuffling of its future strategy. Plans for the affordable $25,000 EV have somewhat disappeared into oblivion, while a deeply unproven Robotaxi concept has reportedly captured CEO Elon Musk’s full attention.
Amidst this pandemonium, mass layoffs are currently underway at Tesla, coinciding with the departure of several top executives. When reports of job cuts surfaced yesterday, it was unclear which divisions would be affected. The automaker has Gigafactories in California, Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai, with planned projects in Mexico and potentially India.
After years of skyrocketing growth, Tesla is cooling down
Tesla has hit its first major roadblock after years of aggressive sales and financial growth. Its Q1 2024 sales plummeted, the affordable Model 2 is reportedly scrapped, and thousands of workers are being laid off. Will this just be a bad chapter in Tesla's story or something to truly worry about?
Documents seen by InsideEVs suggest that job cuts are affecting several roles. This includes project managers, automation engineers, ergonomics designers, and data analysts, among others.
The firing spans across the U.S.—the majority of that in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas. Several roles are being slashed in Dallas, New York, Toronto and Palo Alto as well. The document suggests job cuts of at least 140 people, mostly engineers.
On the other side of the planet, two sources Reuters spoke to said more than 10% of Tesla China’s sales team were losing their jobs, whereas a relatively small proportion of employees working at Gigafactory Shanghai, Tesla’s largest global manufacturing and export hub by volume, would be let go.
German media is reporting that 3,000 of Tesla Germany’s 12,000 workforce have been fired. Yet, some 686 Tesla job postings are open in Germany alone. Tesla Germany has refuted the German media reports. ""We will pursue the measure for Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg against the background of all labor law and co-determination requirements, bringing in the works council,"" a Tesla Germany official told Reuters.
Tesla’s global headcount is estimated to be somewhere around 140,000, according to Elektrek. A 10% reduction would mean a whopping 14,000 job cuts. So the layoffs could be underway for several more days. We’ll know its true impact in the next few weeks.
No other brand has electrified the auto industry in the same way as Tesla, especially in the U.S. After four years of aggressive growth, it’s hard to predict if this rough patch will be prolonged, or if the brand will bounce back in the next quarter.

"Maserati Ramps Up Its Electrification Plans, With One Big Caveat",https://insideevs.com/news/716170/maserati-folgore-day-announcement/,"Maserati has big plans to move on from screaming Ferrari V8 engines, while keeping sounds and rumbles for future EVs too.",2024-04-15 14:47:24,"The hot thing for automakers to do now is to hold an ""EV Day"" event to show off future electric plans, and despite being known for its ferocious internal combustion engines, even Maserati is no exception. And today during Maserati’s ""Folgore Day"" press conference in Italy, the automaker announced it was moving up the timeline on its all-electric future by two years, from 2030 to 2028.
Maserati’s lineup will include electric versions of all its vehicles by 2025, aiming to phase out its gas-powered cars before the end of 2028. (Folgore, which translates to lightning in Italian, is the brand’s nomenclature for its EV lineup.)
Maserati goes electric
The Italian brand is most famous for putting Ferrari engines into luxurious SUVs and sedans. Transitioning to an electric era without such an obvious character may prove more difficult for Maserati than others.
However, that statement comes with a significantly sized asterisk. Maserati CEO Davide Grasso told reporters at the Folgore Day press conference that different markets are adapting to electrification at different rates. In other words, all systems are go for an all-EV lineup, but the words “customer choice” were uttered several times, implying that it’s poised to pivot depending on which way the market swings.
That's in keeping with recent moves seen from other automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Ford, who have gotten somewhat skittish about the slowing rate of EV adoption despite the market being pushed heavily in that direction by emissions regulations. Still, in the meantime, the automaker is in the process of phasing out its trademark V8 along with the engine’s signature roar.
Maserati, like many luxury and supercar manufacturers, is dancing on a fine line.
Maserati launched its first all-electric vehicle, the 761-hp GranTurismo Folgore, in 2022. Following on its heels later today is the reveal of its droptop version, the GranCabrio Folgore, which Maserati calls the ""first"" luxury all-electric convertible on the market. That ignores the Tesla Roadster, but they must not count that as a luxury car.
The architecture it uses was designed to be modular so it can work for a gas-powered or electric motor with what Maserati calls “minimal adaptations.”  Employing three 300-kilowatt permanent magnet motors, the GranTurismo and GranCabrio include 800-volt technology for fast charging.
Like the newest Ram 1500 pickup truck in the Stellantis lineup, Maserati’s new EV is built with the Atlantis High electrical architecture, previously seen in the GranTurismo. Equipped with more advanced cyber-security and over-the-air update capabilities, the EV convertible also uses Maserati-designed software.
When it comes to the EV market, Maserati may not be the first brand that comes to mind.
What Maserati brings to the EV transition is couched in choice, which makes sense for this vintage Italian automaker. Known for putting Ferrari-sourced engines into four-door sedans, Maserati is a company known for what you hear behind the wheel. That may make it a tough sell for people who loved the idea of supercar-grade engines powering luxurious SUVs and family cars.
But its CEO sees things differently. “Electrification is an incredible opportunity,” Grasso said today.
The company has put some time, energy, and cash into sound effects for its EVs to bridge the gap. Working closely with Sonus Faber (Italian companies stick together) to create a bespoke 3D sound system that can be heard inside and out, the GranTurismo and GranCabrio will imitate its gas-powered predecessors’ rumble. A similar system will be heard on Stellantis cousin Dodge's new electric Charger as well.
South Florida is the seat of Maserati’s highest-earning dealerships, catering to a mostly-retired community with its luxury cars. It’s reasonable to believe that those buyers won’t make the jump to the Folgore lineup, but Grasso begs to differ.
“Modern luxury customers tend to be Alpha customers who move faster,” he said today, adding, “The roots of our brand builds our future.”
While Head of design Klaus Busse says the Trident represents a “don’t mess with me” message, but it’s “not in your face.” That tracks, as Maserati gives off a vibe of elegance versus its wilder countrymate Lamborghini, which drives like a cheetah pulling on a leash.
However, a new commercial for the Trident stars Damiano David, the lead singer of Gen Z-loving rock band Måneskin. It's quite a choice for the brand. The musician is most definitely in your face, etched with tattoos that cover his body, including his hands—all of which are visible in the commercial. David dates (as of last celebrity sightings) American actress Dove Cameron and walks with a swagger only an Italian Alpha male can convincingly pull off. He dresses and undresses, titillating in a way that Maserati hasn’t in the past.
The new ad is a little shocking in its brazen audacity; it’s clear that South Florida isn’t the targeted demographic for the future. It’s a smart move, too, because the next generation will determine the direction of automotive propulsion, design, and functionality. By focusing on the craftsmanship and performance of the Maserati legacy, the brand can make the switch to EVs as planned.
Today, however, Maserati is living in sin with electrification but hasn’t put a ring on it. As quickly as the market is shifting, it’s keeping its options open.

"China Paid Billions In Aid To Local EV Makers, Including Tesla, To Dominate The Market: Study",https://insideevs.com/news/716063/china-ev-subsidies-byd-tesla-billions-study/,"BYD was the biggest beneficiary of China’s support scheme, raking $3.7 billion in direct subsidies.",2024-04-15 14:00:15,"China spent billions of dollars to boost the competitiveness of its local electric vehicle industry, according to a new study published last week by Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy quoted by Bloomberg.
The think tank, which advises the German government, said that China’s aid to domestic new energy vehicles amounted to roughly $5.6 billion until 2022 when the direct payments to manufacturers were phased out. New energy vehicles (NEVs) include all-electric cars (EVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs).
How China boosted its EV game through direct subsidies
While most Western nations are trying to boost sales of battery-powered vehicles by essentially reducing the purchase price of a new car, China's approach has been to send the money directly to the automakers.
How much money? Roughly $5.6 billion until 2022, according to a new study from Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The biggest beneficiary of China’s support scheme was BYD, which received $3.7B in direct aid from 2018 to 2022. The lion’s share was awarded in 2022, with BYD getting $2.2B from the Chinese government.

Tesla, which competes directly with BYD both on the domestic market and on a global scale, was the second largest beneficiary of China’s support scheme in 2022. The American-based EV maker received about $426 million from the Chinese government for the cars it manufactured at its Shanghai facility.
China’s direct purchase subsidy scheme was axed at the end of 2022, according to the German think tank that published the study. The scheme awarded between $1,380 and $2,400 on average for each new energy vehicle manufactured in China between 2010 and 2022.
Compared to other countries that offer some sort of subsidy for the purchase of a new environmentally friendly vehicle, including the United States, the biggest difference in China was that the state gave the money to the car makers and not the buyer.
Even though this particular support scheme has been phased out, China’s battery electric vehicle buyers are exempt from paying a 10% purchase tax. In 2024 and 2025, the country will apply a complete purchase tax exemption for all NEVs, not just EVs, amounting to savings of about $4,200 on average per vehicle, according to the institute. This exemption will be halved in 2026 and 2027.
The think added that besides the direct subsidies applied until 2022, China’s EV industry also benefited from subsidized pricing on important materials such as steel and batteries, as well as discriminatory government procurement, both of which are hard to measure.
“The very comprehensive and opaque Chinese subsidy system blurs the difference between domestic subsidies which do not distort trade and subsidies intended to help domestic companies to conquer export markets and thus are trade distortive,” Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy said.
The figures put things in perspective after the European Commission officially launched an anti-subsidy investigation into the import of battery-powered vehicles from China in October 2023. The Commission argued that it found sufficient evidence demonstrating that EV imports from China benefit from subsidies that allow them to rapidly increase their market share in the European Union. This could ultimately threaten the Bloc’s domestic industry and demotivate investments, the Commission said.
If the European Commission’s investigation confirms these allegations, the EU could impose retroactive tariffs against battery-powered cars imported from China, a move that was not seen with too much enthusiasm by the Chinese government or some local German automakers last year.
The increasing dominance of China’s EV makers has also urged some American officials to speak out in favor of tariff spikes. Earlier this year, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley proposed legislation to hike the Chinese vehicle import total tariff to 125% from 27.5% currently. The bill also seeks to apply a 100% tariff increase to vehicles assembled in Mexico by Chinese-based automakers.",Iulian Dnistran
The U.S. Paid $580 Million In Point-Of-Sale EV Tax Credits So Far This Year,https://insideevs.com/news/716072/point-of-sale-ev-rebates-580-million-april-2024/,"The IRS received roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports since January 1.",2024-04-15 13:00:49,"The fact that buyers of new electric cars in the United States can benefit from the $7,500 tax credit at the point of sale seems to be a pretty big hit among customers.
According to the U.S. Treasury, the government reimbursed car dealers for more than $580 million in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments so far this year, with the Internal Revenue Service receiving roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports since January 1.
The point-of-sale EV tax credit is a pretty big hit, it seems
Wit roughly 100,000 time-of-sale EV reports received by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so far this year, it seems that American EV shoppers are enjoying the fact that they can benefit from the EV tax credits at the point of sale.
Until the end of last year, people who were eligible for a new EV tax credit of up to $7,500 or the $4,000 used EV credit could benefit from them only when they filed their tax returns the next year.
More EV Tax Credit Stories
The rules changed at the beginning of 2024, however, allowing buyers to transfer the credits to a car dealer at the time of sale, which effectively lowers the purchase price of the car and eliminates the hassle of worrying about filing tax returns in the year following the purchase.
That said, customers need to attest they meet certain income limits to qualify for the tax credit when they buy the EV. Otherwise, they will need to repay the government when filing their taxes, so the worries aren’t completely gone–a little caution is needed, that’s all. For new EVs, the adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals.
“Demand is high four months into implementation of this new provision,” said Treasury spokesperson Haris Talwar last week.
Introduced in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the EV tax credits can be applied to eligible vehicles that are assembled in North America. At the beginning of 2024, the rules were changed to exclude battery-powered vehicles that include battery components from so-called “foreign entities of concern” (FEOC) like China, Iran and Russia.
When the changes went into effect, no fewer than 24 models were disqualified from receiving the $7,500 tax credit, leaving just 19 EVs on the list. Since then, some battery-powered cars, including the Volkswagen ID.4, Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadilac Lyriq have regained eligibility.",Iulian Dnistran
"Aston Martin Delays First EV, Will Sell PHEVs Into The 2030s",https://insideevs.com/news/715800/aston-martin-delays-first-ev/,This means power for future plug-in Astons will come from a combination of AMG V8 and its own V12 engines aided by electric motors.,2024-04-11 14:30:03,"Just as the electric vehicle market started showing signs of slowing down, several automakers, especially those with low-volume production and a high price point, have adjusted their stance on EVs. They have announced that they will keep producing cars with combustion engines for longer than previous estimates and that they don’t plan to stop until they are legally obligated to do so.
Aston Martin is the most recent automaker to make a similar announcement. Its official plan was to launch its first EV in 2025, but in February of this year, it announced that it had been pushed back to 2026. That made the company’s commitment to EVs not seem as strong as before, and it seems to be confirmed by a statement recently made by the company’s executive chairman, Lawrence Stroll.
Aston Martin fears that going electric will make its customers vanish
Low-volume, high-price point automakers like Aston Martin don't want to go electric fearing their very small customer base, which wants powerful and noisy combustion engines, will disappear if it goes all-in on EVs.
According to PistonHeads, the Aston Boss, referring to the brand’s first EV, said “We planned to launch the first car next year in 2025. We were ready to do so, but it seems there is a lot more hype in the EV market that was politically driven rather than by consumer demand. Particularly at an Aston Martin price point.”
He also confirmed that much of the development work on Aston’s bespoke EV platform was done and that the automaker intends to use it to underpin four different models: “a sports car, an SUV, a type of CUV and a halo hypercar. We have all those products designed and technically engineered, so that process is done.”
Stroll also noted that “We are going to invest much more heavily in our PHEV program to be a bridge between full combustion and full electric” because the brand’s customers want cars that make noise and have an exciting combustion-centric powertrain. He also announced that the Aston Martin EV would be pushed back by another year so it would arrive in 2027 and that more emphasis would be put on plug-in hybrids until then.
These future Aston PHEVs will feature both the AMG twin-turbo V8 as well as the brand’s own V12, so we can expect power outputs to reach close to 1,000 horsepower in the most potent models. These cars will be both front- and mid-engined, and there’s no reason for Aston to stop selling them until well into the mid-2030s or “for as long as we’re allowed to legally, we will keep making them. I believe there will always be a demand, although granted that demand will shrink,” according to Stroll.
The first series plug-in from Aston Martin is expected to be a PHEV version of the DBX, the brand's first SUV. It is currently available with the AMG-sourced twin-turbo V8, which makes 550 horsepower in the base version, but with the addition of an electric motor, it could make over 800 horsepower and provide a few dozen fully electric miles of range.

BMW And Rimac Sign Partnership For Next-Gen EV Battery Packs,https://insideevs.com/news/715502/bmw-rimac-ev-battery-partnership/,"Rimac has supplied its innovative EV tech to big automakers before, which in turn bought significant chunks of the company.",2024-04-09 12:30:05,"The Rimac Group is an automaker and automotive technology company based in Zagreb, Croatia, which is known for its 800-volt electric vehicle architecture that enables EVs to run more efficiently and charge very quickly. After entering important partnerships with Porsche and Hyundai, Rimac has just announced another venture with a big-name car brand, BMW. It also owns Bugatti now.
According to the official announcement, this is a long-term strategic commitment between BMW and Rimac Technology (the engineering arm of the company that supplies powertrains for third-party EVs) to “create innovative solutions for the high-voltage batteries in future selected vehicle projects.”
Rimac is known for its 800-volt architecture and the mighty Nevera
Rimac not only supplied the 800-volt technology used in Porsche and Hyundai-Kia EVs, but it also created the world's first electric hypercar, the monstrous Nevera with over 1,900 horsepower.
This sounds like BMW will not be directly supplied by Rimac, but it will use the latter’s know-how to develop its own next-gen EV batteries. Even though we know the upcoming range of Neue Klasse models will feature an 800-volt architecture, we doubt these new batteries developed with Rimac’s help will be what powers the new line of BMW EVs, the first of which should debut before the end of 2024.
At the end of its press release announcing the partnership, BMW makes it clear that its sixth-generation eDrive technology (that will power Neue Klasse models) was developed separately and without input from Rimac. However, that’s not to say Neue Klasse models can’t receive improved batteries co-engineered with Rimac as part of an update after they are launched.
BMW says it will “release more details about what form the strategic tie-up will take, as well as its scope and content, at a later stage.” The exact same phrase is used in the press release published by Rimac, which doesn’t reveal any additional information.
The founder and CEO of Rimac, Mate Rimac, notes that this important partnership with BMW is “a clear sign of the transition of Rimac Technology from niche high-performance supplier to high-volume production capability. With the relentless growth of our business, including the opening of Rimac Campus, we’re now ready to deliver large-scale projects for the leading brands in the automotive industry.”
But even if details are currently very limited, this collaboration is intriguing. Let’s not forget that Rimac makes the world’s quickest-accelerating road-legal car, the bonkers-quick Nevera, a vehicle that is quite similar in philosophy to what BMW would make were it to launch an electric hypercar. Rimac says this is “the largest and most ambitious project the company has undertaken to date,” and it’s already involved in some pretty big projects, so the BMW-Rimac partnership is definitely very exciting news.

"Polestar Doesn’t See Tesla As A Rival, Has Its Eye On Porsche Customers",https://insideevs.com/news/715351/polestar-rivals-porsche-luxury-brands/,"The Volvo spinoff brand wants to be measured against Porsche and other premium automakers, not Tesla.",2024-04-08 16:00:09,"Selling as many cars as possible is what the vast majority of automakers want, but not all of them are interested in huge volumes that would rival Tesla, which sold about 1.8 million cars globally in 2023. Polestar has models that directly rival Tesla’s, like the Polestar 2, which is an EV that the company admitted was going after Model 3 sales, but it wants to position itself as more premium and attract more “luxury” customers from established premium brands like Germany’s big three or Porsche.
Australia’s Drive talked to Graeme Lambert, who is Polestar’s global communications executive for Design, Innovation and APAC (Asia-Pacific), who explained Polestar’s different focus. He noted that Tesla was “chasing volume” and that it is “a mass-market player,” while explaining that Polestar is “a premium luxury brand with volume targets that are in line with that.”
Polestar wants Porsche buyers
Even though Polestar sells vehicles that are similar in size and scope to Teslas, its offerings are more expensive and the Volvo spinoff brand would like to woo buyers away from the likes of Porsche.
This is evident in Polestar’s much less ambitious annual sales target, which has been set at between 155,000 and 165,000 vehicles in 2025. That’s considerably less than Tesla, which is expected to sell around 2.2 million vehicles this year, even though in the year’s first quarter, it manufactured more cars than it could deliver and is now offering big discounts for those who accept buying from inventory.
Tesla is known for its unexpected and often significant discounts, and this is another part of its business model that Polestar couldn’t hope to match. Lambert mentioned one of Polestar’s new models, the Polestar 4, as being a direct rival for the Tesla Model Y, at least in terms of size and scope. However, he explains that Polestar is actually hoping it will attract Porsche Macan EV buyers, which is another EV similar in size to a Model Y, but a lot more expensive.
Even though Polestar started its existence as a sporty, electrified Volvo spinoff, the Swedish manufacturer announced that it had no plans to keep supporting Polestar financially. It is still owned by Volvo’s parent company, Geely, and it announced that it had secured part of the funding it needed to stay afloat. In the future, we are likely to see an even bigger divergence between the vehicles sold by Polestar and Volvo, although they will still share platforms and technology.
The Polestar 4 electric coupe-SUV starts at $56,300, but it can go up to $74,300 in dual-motor Performance spec. That makes it a bit more expensive than the Tesla Model Y, whose base variant costs $44,990, but it undercuts the Porsche Macan EV with its starting price of $78,800 (or $105,300 in Macan Turbo guise).
Polestar is also working on a rival for the Porsche Taycan, which will be called the Polestar 5, and it should enter production by the end of the year. It is expected to start at around $100,000 (just like the Taycan), offer almost 900 horsepower in top trim, and surpass 300 miles of EPA range with its 103-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It will also be a rival for the Model S, but Tesla’s big sedan is considerably cheaper, with a starting price of $76,630.

"Nissan To Slash EV Production Cost By 30%, Says U.S. CEO",https://insideevs.com/news/715075/nissan-30-percent-ev-cost-reduction/,The projected cost reduction seems to be in line with what other automakers are predicting for their next-gen EVs.,2024-04-05 13:00:55,"Nissan is a pioneer of electric vehicles, but it lost the early lead it achieved with its Leaf, and now it’s struggling to catch up to newer EV players such as Tesla or Hyundai-Kia. One way it plans to make its future EVs more popular is to sell them for less, and a company official recently announced that Nissan’s next-generation electric models will cost around 30% less to manufacture current EVs like the Leaf or the Ariya.
According to Jérémie Papin, Nissan's US CEO, quoted by Yahoo Finance, the automaker will achieve these cost savings through “simplification” and “greater commonality across many of the models.” This means there will not only be fewer components going into the construction of an electric vehicle but more of them will be shared with other models.
Nissan needs more and better EVs
Nissan's EVs aren't currently the most desirable, although sales of the Ariya are going up, and one way to make them more attractive to buyers is by making them cheaper to manufacture and then passing on the savings to the consumer.
Papin also expects electric and electrified vehicles to reach price parity with combustion cars by the decade's end. One way Nissan could achieve this would be by ditching its plans to go all-in on solid-state batteries by 2028. However, solid-state batteries are expensive and aren't expected to go down in price enough until the self-imposed deadline (unless there's a breakthrough) to allow the manufacturer to achieve the 30% savings by adopting this new battery tech—it may continue to research lithium-ion batteries to achieve the desired savings.
Nissan is not giving up on solid-state batteries, though, and it’s setting up a pilot production facility in Japan where it plans to start experimenting with manufacturing solid-state cells and packs. Even though solid-state batteries are still considerably more expensive, Nissan believes they are the key to bringing the price of EVs down. It aims to reduce the cost per kilowatt hour to $65 by 2028.
Of the 30 new models that Nissan plans to launch by 2026, 16 will be electrified, but it didn’t say how many would be pure EVs. It needs a broader swathe of BEV models if it has any chance of competing with rival manufacturers, and a range comprised of the Leaf and Ariya isn’t enough.
The Ariya saw a 44.8% US sales increase in Q1 2024, while sales of the Leaf went down by over 50% in the same quarter. Nissan is looking to launch an electric pickup truck in the US, which is expected to arrive around the end of the decade and be a collaborative effort with Mitsubishi. Honda is another potential partner to help Nissan make more EVs.

Polestar 7 To Succeed 2 In Brand’s Next-Generation EV Portfolio,https://insideevs.com/news/714997/polestar-7-to-replace-2-electric-sedan-in-2027/,CEO Thomas Ingenlath said he’s not inclined to follow a VW Golf-like evolution of the Polestar 2 nameplate.,2024-04-04 17:00:35,"The Polestar 2 has single-handedly led the charge in the Swedish automaker’s quest to offer cutting-edge and premium electric cars. Despite it being a great car, it’s not quite blown up the sales charts. Its 2023 global sales were up only 4% year-over-year with just over 53,000 units sold, and Q4 2023 sales were down by 43%. To fix this, Polestar will radically reinvent the EV when it reaches the end of its lifespan by 2027. And that reinvention starts with a new name: Polestar 7.
Polestar’s naming strategy seems muddled. The 2 is a sedan on stilts, 3 is the SUV, 4 is the coupe-style SUV, and the 5—if the brand survives till then in its current form—is expected to be something like the Tesla Model S and Porsche Taycan. The 6 is a sportscar and the 7 will now circle back to the next-generation 2. Don’t worry if you have difficulty associating these numbers with the correct body style, even someone who writes about EVs daily has this issue.
Polestar Makes A Case For Itself
CEO Thomas Ingenlath is confident that the brand is all about exclusivity, performance and cutting-edge tech. But so are several others. At a time when the EV market is realigning towards affordability, Polestar would need some solid business strategy, and maybe some stroke of luck to sustain.
“As much as we might build a very similar car, because it has a different number we won’t have this natural trap where we’re boxed into that concept of what the car had been,” Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Autocar. “As nice as it is to have a ‘Golf’ category of car, it’s very limiting in terms of innovative power, because you’re always back in the box of what the ‘Golf’ should be,” Ingenlath added.
The report states that Polestar 7 would likely be underpinned by parent company Geely Group’s Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), or a new iteration of the same. The Polestar 4, Zeekr 001, and Volvo EX30 ride on this platform.
The broader EV industry is now realigning towards smaller and affordable EVs to attain profitability, but Polestar’s approach is the opposite. Ahead of the ongoing New York International Auto Show, Ingenlath chatted with InsideEVs about the Polestar 4, how the company aims to come out of its current financial and sales troubles, and its larger EV ambitions in the coming years.
“There’s only that much you can do with Polestar 2,” Ingenlath told InsideEVs. “But three cars in our range mean growing the company in terms of volume. The segments that these cars are in means revenue opportunity as well,” he added, referring to adding the Polestar 3 and 4 to its U.S. line-up this year. “You have to be clear about the nature of your company, and for us, it's the performance [focused] and premium exclusive segment.”
Dozens of new EVs will enter the market by 2027, so the Polestar 7 would have to be something truly radical to leave a mark.

Nissan And Mitsubishi Team Up For U.S.-Spec Electric Pickup Truck,https://insideevs.com/news/714510/nissan-mitsubishi-electric-pickup-phev/,"The deal will also result in a Nissan-badged plug-in hybrid, as well as an all-electric Mitsubishi.",2024-04-01 09:00:01,"Nissan and Mitsubishi struck a deal to develop several electrified vehicles specifically for the United States market in a bid to minimize development costs in a time when the growth of all-electric vehicles has slowed and major manufacturers are looking to plug-in hybrids as a stopgap until EVs regain momentum.
Currently, Mitsubishi doesn’t have any all-electric vehicles on sale in the U.S. and Nissan doesn’t have any plug-in hybrids. Moreover, neither companies offer a battery-powered pickup. But all of this is going to change in the coming years.
Japanese automakers form alliances to cut EV development costs
Nissan is teaming up with Mitsubishi to try and lower the development costs of future plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. The deal between the two Japanese automakers will reportedly produce at least three models, including an all-electric Mitsubishi, a plug-in hybrid Nissan, and a battery-powered mid-size pickup truck co-developed specifically for the U.S. market. Previously, Nissan signed a memorandum of understanding with Honda to explore how they can work on EV-specific tech together.
According to Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida, quoted by Automotive News, this first-ever cross-company collaboration between the two marques for the U.S. market will yield at least three distinct vehicles. The news comes after the reported talks between Nissan and Fisker were put to rest and after Nissan announced it would work together with Honda to develop EV-specific tech.
More Industry Stories
Nissan will use tech from Mitsubishi, which makes the Outlander PHEV, to launch a plug-in hybrid and Mitsubishi will launch a new car in the U.S. using Nissan’s EV technology, possibly the same used in the Ariya crossover.
A timeline for these launches hasn’t been provided, but during Nissan’s latest presentation, the Japanese company said it will launch 30 new models by fiscal year 2026, 16 of which will be electrified. Hence, we expect the two new models from Nissan and Mitsubishi to hit the streets in the next two years.
An all-electric 1-ton pickup truck will also be co-developed by the two Nippon automakers and will probably result in two different models. Automotive News speculated that this new EV, which is bound to debut sometime between 2027 and 2031, will likely be a successor to the combustion-powered Nissan Frontier.
2022 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X
2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV
2024 Nissan Ariya
The battery-powered mid-size pickup will reportedly be manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States and Latin America to circumvent import tariffs that are faced by models brought in from overseas. The source also writes that a plug-in hybrid version of the future pickup is also under consideration.
""In North America, we will receive a supply of vehicles from our alliance partners to a certain extent. We will receive what is necessary [for] our overall product lineup,"" Mitsubishi Vice President Hiroshi Nagaoka said back in February. ""In the electrification shift, new cars will become necessary. So we are discussing with our partners.""
It’s unclear at this point if the EV, PHEV, and electric pickup will be badge engineering jobs or distinct models from Nissan and Mitsubishi. Using tech from an alliance partner is a quick and relatively inexpensive way for an automaker to reach its fleet emissions goals, but simply sticking another badge on an existing car has been known to dilute the name of the company in the customer’s eyes.

"Polestar CEO: 'Crucial' Year Ahead With New SUVs, No Plans For Cheaper EVs",https://insideevs.com/news/714379/polestar-ceo-nyas-interview/,"Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath tells InsideEVs about differentiating from Volvo, parent Geely's commitment and being profitable by 2025.",2024-03-29 16:48:10,"Thomas Ingenlath clearly doesn't think the Polestar 2 has gotten its due.
""Polestar was a one-car company in 2023,"" the brand's CEO told InsideEVs at the New York Auto Show this week. ""The big burden was on the shoulders of the Polestar 2.""
Still, he said, ""Polestar delivered 54,000 cars [globally] in 2023. That is something that puts us ahead of a lot of EV competitors. Our business will grow this year... that's [going to be] a rare thing in 2024.""
Polestar's challenges lie ahead
2024 is indeed a critical year for Polestar, an EV performance brand spun off from Volvo that has yet to become a household name. With two new electric SUVs coming soon, it hopes it can achieve mass-volume success and convince investors of its viability.
The drivers of that growth are expected to be the two crossovers that were parked on stage behind Ingenlath when we spoke: the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4. And it's hard to overstate how important both EVs will be to Polestar's long-term viability.
Even if the Polestar 2—a sedan doing battle in an SUV world—managed more deliveries than Lucid or Rivian in 2023, the company still dealt with tremendous headwinds last year and the first part of this one. It had to delay, for the second time, the Polestar 3 flagship crossover due to software issues that also impacted its corporate cousin Volvo. Rental car giant Hertz backed off a big plan to purchase 65,000 Polestar 2s after getting hammered by Tesla repair costs and dropping resale values. Its stock price hit the skids, so much so that Volvo cut its investment in the brand. Analysts, and the financial press, still don't think very highly of its current state.
While it's Ingenlath's job to be optimistic, in New York he seemed more relieved than anything. The Polestar 3 is due out this summer with a starting price of $73,400. The Polestar 4 starts at $54,900. The order books open in late April, and deliveries are planned for the fourth quarter. Both cars, which should reach far more family buyers than the compact Polestar 2 sedan, should help the brand's dreams for critical mass.
Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath and Polestar Precept Concept
""In order to get to [that] model lineup, in 25 countries where we do business, people forget how long it took Tesla to actually get there,"" Ingenlath said. ""It was a decade before they actually got noticed. As a new brand in the EV sector, you actually have to come to the table a bit faster.""
But critical mass doesn't mean mass appeal, Ingenlath said. There are no plans for cheaper models in the Polestar portfolio, or ones that go below the Polestar 2 in price.
""The portfolio that we have starts at the Polestar 2 price level and it goes all the way up to you know where 5 and 6 will be,"" he said, referring to an upcoming sedan and sports car. ""The mass market is not our market.""
He added, ""If you go there, fine, but it's a completely different game. You have to be clear about the nature of your company. And for us, it's that premium, exclusive, performance segment.""
Ingenlath is very clear that he envisions Polestar as a performance brand, specifically calling out BMW's M division and Porsche. That's especially tough competition, particularly as both German automakers are doing surprisingly well in the EV game right now.
But Ingenlath said that's a key part of how Polestar differentiates itself from Volvo, with which it shares some manufacturing facilities, technology and components. And he says the brand can pull it off.
""The Polestar 3's [center of gravity] is as low as a Polestar 1,"" he said, referring to the brand's original grand tourer hybrid coupe. ""Scandinavian design, but much more techy, much more driver-oriented, much more on the performance side. Very different from where the core brand values of Volvo are.""
Telling the two brands apart can be a challenge, and even people inside both Scandinavian car companies don't always have a great answer to where one begins and the other ends.
But Ingenlath said that the parent company of both, Chinese conglomerate Geely, is sticking with the two brands in North America long term. Some skeptics have wondered if that was still the case, considering the U.S. tour that just happened with another Geely brand, Zeekr.
""I have the certainty that Geely is very committed to the Polestar brand,"" Ingenlath said, likening it to Volkswagen operating similar divisions like SEAT and Skoda in Europe.
Still, Polestar is developing workarounds for the increasing political tensions between the U.S. and China that may lead to stricter tariffs on those cars, even ones made in Mexico. The Polestar 2 is built in China, but the Polestar 3 will be built in South Carolina soon and the Polestar 4 will be made in South Korea. It's why Ingenlath said he's less than worried about political headwinds in the U.S. that may not favor EVs after the November election.
""This is about jobs in the U.S. that we provide, and I think that's something that any politician should keep in mind,"" he said.

"Hyundai Ioniq 5 And 6 Are Profitable; Company 'Studying' Range Extenders, CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/714104/hyundai-range-extender-interview/,"Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor America's CEO, says the Korean automaker wants to offer options but is ""all-in on EVs.""",2024-03-27 15:00:58,"Suppose you happen to be the sort of person who worries about Hyundai's profit margins when you can't sleep at night. In that case, the automaker's American CEO doesn't want you to be too concerned about the bottom line when you see aggressive zero-down, $239-a-month lease deals on the electric Ioniq 6 sedan.
""We don't sell cars that are not profitable,"" Hyundai Motor America's CEO Randy Parker told InsideEVs in a wide-ranging interview today at the New York Auto Show. ""That's a big strategy strategy of ours. We don't sell cars at losses.""
Hyundai's EV push is working
While other automakers have demurred on EV plans somewhat after a few quarters of slowing growth, Korea's Hyundai, Kia and Genesis have not been among them. The company has a huge array of gas-powered cars but plans to roll out several new EV models in the next few years.
It's a fair question to ask, given how many automakers are losing money on EVs, especially ones sold at more mainstream, below-luxury prices. Parker's answer is especially interesting considering the lease price of a base Ioniq 6 SE—at least until the start of April—makes it about the cheapest new vehicle to lease in the U.S. But it works, Parker said, because both the Ioniq 6 and Ioniq 5 models are profitable.
""The market has gotten a lot tougher in 2024,"" Parker said, alluding to the rate of EV adoption proving to be slower than many automakers initially expected. ""Our deals are basically a consequence of just being competitive in the marketplace. We know we've got a great product. But we also know that consumers are looking for affordability, especially when it comes to EVs.""
Parker added, ""We came up with this lease to ensure we didn't lose our sales momentum.""
That does seem to be working well for the Hyundai Motor Group in the U.S. Including its Kia sibling and Genesis luxury division, the conglomerate sold more EVs in the U.S. last year than General Motors or Ford, and that was before the Kia EV9 even hit its sales stride. Additionally, Hyundai's larger three-row SUV, the Hyundai Ioniq 7—or Ioniq 9, depending on who you ask—is also set to debut this year. (Parker declined to comment on the car's anticipated name change.)
""We're keeping everything within our budget,"" Parker said of Hyundai's lease deals. ""I've got a very tough boss and he's not gonna let me get outside of my incentive budget, but for now, it's working for us.""
It's also working because Hyundai's EVs—all of which are built in Korea at the moment—do not qualify for any EV tax credit, which remains a kind of sticking point for the company. According to Parker's own boss, the Korean automaker got assurances their cars would qualify from the Biden Administration, only for that to not end up being the case. Instead, Hyundai has benefitted from the $7,500 tax credit being applied to leases, and the company's dealers also offer the same as a cash incentive.
That will change as Hyundai opens its new ""Metaplant"" in Georgia in the fourth quarter of this year. While Parker demurred when asked what EV (or EVs) that plant will build, he said those cars will qualify for tax incentives when they come off the line. And they can't come soon enough, he said.
""One of the things that's holding me back right now is capacity,"" Parker said. ""It's the only way we can grow."" Parker added that a program to sell Hyundai's cars via Amazon, then check out with financing and delivery via a local dealer, will be open to more customers in ""late summer.""
The New York Auto Show saw Hyundai's EVs win a number of awards, but this year, the cars that made their debut were gas-powered: the updated Hyundai Tucson SUV and Santa Cruz truck. More hybrids are coming to the portfolio as well.
But when asked if Hyundai had any plans for range-extended EVs—cars built from the ground up to be electric vehicles, but that also carry some kind of internal combustion engine to serve as a generator—Parker said those may be in the cards.
""I can't release any details, but most definitely,"" he said. ""We're studying this as we speak.""
A number of competitors are eyeing range-extended EVs as future options; a few examples include the new Ram 1500 Ramcharger and the upcoming Mercedes CLA-Class, not to mention the old BMW i3. In theory, this will allow automakers to keep building EV platforms but also offer customers options for fueling to help with range concerns.
But Parker said he's confident about where things are going.
""I want to make that very clear, we're all in when it comes to EVs,"" he said, adding that Hyundai has the flexibility to make more hybrids if demand skews that way.
""Hybrids, you know, they're fine,"" he said. ""It's a good transition for a lot of people. But if you really want to become carbon neutral, it's got to be done through EVs.""

It's generally accepted to be a latecomer to electric vehicles and EV technology, but it repeatedly assures its customers that it has big plans for battery-powered cars. Then again, it still isn't giving up that ill-fated hydrogen push, it doesn't really seem to want hybrids to go anywhere in the long-term, and when we look at its lobbying efforts, we find a concerted effort against EVs.

Speaking [at a dealer breakfast in 2023] was Stephen Ciccone, Toyota’s top lobbyist. He said the industry was facing an existential crisis — not because of the economy or fuel prices, but because of stronger tailpipe pollution limits being proposed in the United States. The rules were “bad for the country, bad for the consumer, and bad for the auto industry,” he said, according to a memo he later circulated among Toyota dealerships that was reviewed by The New York Times.
“For more than two years, Toyota and our dealer partners have stood alone in the fight against unrealistic BEV mandates,” he wrote, using the acronym for battery-electric vehicles. “We have taken a lot of hits from environmental activists, the media, and some politicians. But we have not — and we will not — back down.”
[The new EPA rules] relaxed major elements of an earlier, more stringent proposal. In particular, the final regulations were favorable to hybrid cars, those that run both on gasoline and electricity — giving a bigger role to a market that Toyota dominates.
Toyota, it appeared, had come out on top.
Pretty much all the automakers had objections to the proposed EPA rules, even the ones who have substantial and public EV plans. But Toyota took a different approach:
Toyota said that it had steadily called on the E.P.A. to provide greater flexibility to meet the regulations. And it said its argument had prevailed, noting that several companies have recently announced plans to offer more hybrids rather than electric cars. “It appears that the industry has moved toward the position Toyota has consistently held,” it said.
The Times also reports that Toyota's efforts had a big impact on getting dealers to push back publicly on EVs, despite them being the fastest-growing new car segment.
In a statement to the Times, Toyota said the best way to reduce emissions ""is to give consumers a variety of choices to meet their needs."" And it's true that replacing purely gas cars with more hybrids—as Toyota's whole lineup seems poised to go—is a vastly better option than the alternative. But it's clear that when Toyota talks about winning, it means winning with its technology. And that's probably not going to go over great with longtime fans who want to move into a Toyota-made EV.
There are always two ways (at least) to look at the EV transition. One is that it can't happen fast enough for climate reasons; the other is that automakers are still for-profit entities who need to keep those profits going until they can scale up to what's inevitably coming, and that timing is hard to get right. The two goals are not in sync, because capitalism probably can't fix climate change, but here we are.
Anyway, the Hyundai Motor Group continues to roll out some new gas-powered cars and more hybrids, some of which we will see at the New York Auto Show this week. But it's also continuing to make huge, undaunted investments into EVs, as Reuters reports today:
South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday it will invest 68 trillion won ($51 billion) over three years to bolster its growth potential in electric vehicles and new mobility business and separately hire 80,000 new employees.
More than half of the investment, or 35.5 trillion won, will be allocated for new research and development infrastructure and assembly lines for electric vehicles, the group said in a statement.
Another 31.1 trillion won will be slated for research and development in electric vehicles, including software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and battery technology, it said.
Across its three brands, the Hyundai Motor Group sold more EVs in 2023 than Ford or General Motors in the U.S. Clearly, it's doing something right there.
Earlier this week, Nissan released more details on The Arc, the name for its interim strategy to get from where it is now—sagging profits, falling sales and still feeling battered by a scandal in its top ranks—and a long-term plan for the 2030s and beyond. Here's Automotive News today diving deeper, including into what this all means for the U.S.:
Nissan is preparing three new batteries for electrified vehicles: a next-generation nickel-cobalt-manganese lithium-ion battery; a lithium iron-phosphate battery; and a solid-state battery.
To supply them, the carmaker plans to secure 60 gigawatt hours of additional capacity in the U.S. through the end of the decade. This will help the carmaker's EVs meet local procurement requirements for government incentives.
Executives say 60 gigawatt hours is enough to supply about 600,000 EVs. It is part of a wider campaign to add 135 gigawatt hours of battery capacity globally through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031.
And also:
Nissan's assembly plant in Canton, Miss., will get an update in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027, and its Smyrna, Tenn., assembly plant will be revamped by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2029.
Meanwhile, Canton and the Decherd, Tenn., powertrain factory will be overhauled for EV production in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027. Modular manufacturing will achieve a 20 percent reduction in per-vehicle production time.
So what Nissan is selling is a pretty hardcore acceleration of its entire business, including and especially on the EV front, to get ready for the end of this decade. But is Nissan up for this? It'd be an epic comeback story if it can pull this off, but that all remains to be seen.
I don't doubt the company is serious about future EV development so it doesn't get left behind long-term by new players from China, Korea and even Tesla. But how do you see this current strategy working out for them over the next few years, then into the 2030s and beyond?

Fisker Won't Get Reported Rescue Partnership With Nissan,https://insideevs.com/news/713743/fisker-nissan-deal-canceled/,"""I can't put it if it is next week or next year, but it is inevitable,"" one investor said about Fisker filing for bankruptcy protection.",2024-03-25 16:35:03,"As Nissan outlines its plans for the immediate future, one thing is apparently not in the cards: a reported tie-up with Fisker Inc. that may have been a significant lifeline for the ailing EV startup.
According to regulatory paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, Fisker received notice from ""the large automaker"" it was said to be in talks with ""that the automaker [has] terminated the negotiations."" The document did not offer further details, except to say that Fisker ""continues to evaluate strategic alternatives"" that may include restructurings, additional capital, debt refinancing or some other means to stay afloat. The news was first reported by TechCrunch today.
Fisker's startup challenges
The Fisker Ocean boasts an impressive and fresh design, but many reviewers have said it feels like an unfinished product. The company has struggled to deliver cars to customers and drum up new demand, and its finances now hang in the balance.
Though it was never officially confirmed by either automaker, the ""large automaker"" partner was widely reported to be Nissan. According to an earlier report from Reuters, Nissan was said to be interested in the Fisker Alaska concept as it seeks to break into the electric pickup truck market. Doing so would've given Fisker a much-needed financial lifeline. That story claimed more than $400 million would've gone to make the truck at one of Fisker's U.S. plants, with Nissan getting its own version of the vehicle.
But as InsideEVs also reported, the benefit to Nissan was far less obvious. Fisker's ""asset-light"" business model means it contracts out with external partners to make its cars, like Austria's Magna Steyr, which builds the Ocean crossover. That car uses a Fisker-owned version of Magna's EV platform and the company buys CATL batteries, so it was tougher to see what unique setup Nissan was ""getting"" from such a deal.
A Fisker spokesperson told InsideEVs the company has no comment beyond the filing. The company halted trading after the news broke today, and it halted production on new vehicles earlier this month.
Today's news is another unfortunate development for Fisker, which in recent months has struggled with deliveries and high-profile quality issues, including one especially scathing high-profile YouTube review.
While many Ocean owners who spoke to InsideEVs said they loved the cars aside from the bugs, the company's future feels more in doubt than ever after today's news. One analyst had grim things to say to Reuters today: ""I can't put it if it is next week or next year, but it is inevitable,"" Thomas Hayes, Chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital, said when asked about the possibility of Fisker filing for bankruptcy protection.",Patrick George
"Why Car Companies May Lose $6,000 On Each EV Sold For $50,000",https://insideevs.com/news/713577/ev-50k-losses-bcg-study/,A new Boston Consulting Group report outlines the challenges automakers face as they scale up EV production.,2024-03-25 13:59:18,"For automakers small and large, old and new, transitioning to a mostly electric future has not been an easy endeavor. Or a cheap one.
With the established ""legacy"" car companies, this has meant ramping up battery and software operations—and learning to make EVs correctly—while keeping profits up by selling gas-powered cars. For the startups, it has meant scaling up production systems for years, typically by selling more expensive EVs first, while trying to survive long enough to even become profitable.
Regulations, Climate And Profits Make A Complicated Mix
Automakers are being pushed toward a mostly zero-emission future by tough new climate regulations across the world. But pivoting their businesses to EVs is tough while being under pressure from investors to keep profits up.
So just how much money are car companies losing on EVs right now? According to one estimate from Boston Consulting Group, as much as $6,000 per EV sold around $50,000.
That data comes to us from BCG's new study, ""Can OEMs Catch the Next Wave of EV Adopters?"" which we also covered here.
""We estimate that most [automakers] currently lose around $6,000 on each EV they effectively sell for $50,000, after accounting for customer tax credits,"" the study said. ""We also estimate that [automakers] will only be able to close half of this cost gap by making the right technology choices; economies of scale as automakers ramp up production will help, too, but they won’t make up the difference.""
I was struck by the specificity of that figure, so I reached out to Andrew Loh, Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG and an author of the study, to learn more.
Here's how they landed on that $6,000 number.
""Take a $60,000 ICE vehicle,"" Loh said. ""A reasonable level of profitability that we've seen historically from ICE vehicles is about 10%,"" he said, stressing that vehicle profit margins exist over a broad range but that number is generally true of mass-market automakers with a strong presence in the U.S.
""Creating the bridge from ICE to EV, you need to add the cost of the battery, which is about $10,000,"" Loh said. ""You add the e-powertrain and incremental electronics, which is about another $5,000. And then you need to add the incremental investment and labor and overhead,"" which tends to be higher because few EV operations exist at scale right now.
Add about another $1,500 per vehicle for plant investments, engineering and other capital costs. Now subtract the ICE powertrain, which Loh said is around $4,000 per vehicle. ""That's what gets you to minus 10% [profits], or minus $6,000, as opposed to plus $6,000 profitability.""
In other words, it just comes down to high capital costs right now in the early stages of EV development, being built at operations that aren't yet fully at scale.
There are obvious exceptions to this, of course. Tesla has been solidly profitable for years, again owing to its manufacturing scale; stable profits were regular especially once it got its Chinese factory rolling. China's BYD is also profitable from making EVs. And luxury automakers in the U.S. are profitable with them too, because they can be sold at much higher prices; BMW, Porsche and Audi are just a few examples.
Again, the startups have this problem too, but in a different way. New operations like Lucid, Fisker and Rivian are believed to lose money on each car until they can cross the so-called ""Valley of Death"" and reach mainstream, volume sales.
So BCG's $6,000 number isn't a hard and fast rule for every brand or price point, but a general example of what's at stake for cars sold for around $50,000—still close to the average new car price in America.
But Loh and the other study authors note that unless automakers make a bigger retreat from EVs, this is a sort of temporary situation. New battery and carmaking plants are being built all of the time in the U.S. alone; new manufacturing techniques and battery chemistries are being developed to raise range while lowering costs; and nearly every automaker is finding ways to get into the cheaper $25,000 range, while still being profitable with them.
He just warned that the ultimate goal of ""profitable, at scale, EV production"" may be further off than some experts think.
""A lot of people have focused in on the cautionary tone of the [report,] and we certainly want to be balanced,"" Loh said. ""We, as a firm, continue to be optimistic about EVs over the long run. The word of caution was more around, if you expect [this new generation of EVs], to all of a sudden, reverse the fortunes, we're not sure that's going to happen completely.""

What The 2024 Election Could Mean For EV Tax Credits,https://insideevs.com/news/713548/election-2024-ev-tax-credit/,Campaign rhetoric points to an uncertain future for EV incentives if Republicans win big this fall.,2024-03-25 10:30:10,"Almost since the beginning of the modern hybrid and electric vehicle movement, the United States government has offered tax incentives for drivers who were willing to take a risk on—and usually pay a premium for—a new automotive technology. In 2002, two years after the Toyota Prius first hit dealer lots in the US and four years before Tesla would show off a 250-mile EV, the federal government launched its first incentives for the purchase of new hybrid vehicles.
Tax credits for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles have been a fixture of the American car buying experience ever since, and research shows they’ve been effective at encouraging the adoption of EVs and hybrids in the United States.
But with EVs serving as one of the many shibboleths in a terminally partisan culture, is the EV tax credit at stake in the coming November election? Considering that the current iteration of the EV tax credit has already been the subject of repeal threats from both sitting members of Congress and presidential hopefuls, that may well be the case.
Automakers and certain regulators are indeed finding ways to ""future-proof"" any major changes to what's trending to be a mostly electric future.
Recently, Stellantis signed a pact with several other automakers to follow California's stricter emissions rules, and new EV and battery factories in the Red State south—which are bringing tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs—are unlikely to go anywhere.
But the EV tax credits themselves may be another story.
The current iteration of the EV tax credit is one of the jewels of President Joe Biden’s crowning legislative achievement, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). When it became law in 2022, the IRA revamped what had previously been a fairly straightforward tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new EV, though manufacturers “ran out” after selling a certain amount of them. The new system progressively limited eligibility for the full credit depending on the origin of battery components and minerals, among other factors.
But it became immediately controversial on the other side of the aisle. For example, freshman Ohio senator J.D. Vance introduced a bill last September that would repeal the IRA’s EV tax credits and establish a $2,500 credit for the purchase of new vehicles manufactured in the United States. In November, now-former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley indicated a plan to repeal all of the IRA’s green energy incentives, the EV credit among them. And the mineral-specific rules have been a repeated target of Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative-leaning West Virginia Democrat who’s retiring from Congress but whose swing-vote power had a tremendous impact on the IRA.
By far the most high-profile critic of pro-EV policies, however,  has been former President Donald Trump, who now has the Republican nomination locked up.
Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would seek to repeal tax incentives for EVs in a second term. He has also said that EVs “don’t go far” and are “too expensive,” that EV incentives are “a hit job” on the Rust Belt’s manufacturing economy and that investing in them will somehow leave America in thrall to China.
With months to go before the polls open, votes can still be influenced by countless factors large and small including, perhaps, an interest in preserving access to EV tax credits. But from today’s vantage point, it seems at least plausible that at least one of the major seats of federal legislative power could change hands. Depending on which way the vote swings and how much, the seats of power could soon be filled by people who are ready and willing to end tax incentives for electric or alternative fuel vehicles.
If Biden is re-elected, all signs point to continued investment in EV infrastructure and at least four more years for the IRA’s EV tax incentives, which are currently set to sunset in 2032. If both houses of Congress and the presidency are controlled by Republicans next January, the party could look to unwind President Biden’s legislative agenda.
But Mike Murphy, a GOP political consultant and founder of the EV Politics Project, says that even then, repeal of the Biden administration’s EV policies is not a mortal lock. “You hear a lot of rhetoric” about repealing EV tax credits and manufacturing incentives, Murphy said, “but whether the votes are really there? It’s easier to say it on the campaign trail than to get it done.”
Murphy would expect pushback from the business community and from governors whose states have seen investments in EV and battery manufacturing, including key battleground states such as Georgia, Ohio, and Tennessee.
If a Trump presidency coincides with a Democrat-majority congress, the executive branch could still hack away at the EV tax credits by using the federal rule-making process to change how and where the credits can be applied, though Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, notes that any such changes would be subject to legal challenge.
Gore also says that the current implementation and rulemaking around these tax credits was “done with that in mind—that everything needs to be iron-clad and defensible, because we want these policies to be durable.”
EV tax credits have certainly been durable so far. They have persisted and evolved over the course of the last two decades, and there are policy arguments in favor on both sides of the political aisle.
The original 2002 tax credit for new hybrid vehicles was born during the George W. Bush administration and was designed, at least in part, to encourage people to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles at a time when the United States was recovering from what turned out to be the first pangs of a major energy crisis—not to mention, a post-9/11 renewed interest in American energy independence. They survived into the Obama years, but most of the tax credits expired after a certain number of vehicles were sold, so automakers like Tesla and General Motors ran out eventually.
The current EV tax credits were designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and reduce America’s dependence on energy from prickly trade partners including China and Russia. Leaders from both major political parties have historically backed policies that encourage energy independence, including drilling for domestic oil, subsidizing renewable energy, and encouraging individuals and businesses to reduce their emissions.
Electric vehicles are also key to automakers’ abilities to meet rising corporate average fuel economy standards, and crucial to reducing carbon emissions long-term. That’s where things start to turn contentious for EVs and, by extension, EV tax credits. Climate change and the attempts to mitigate it have become partisan issues for many in the United States. A Pew Research Center report released last summer found that 78 percent of Democrats consider climate change a major threat, compared to only 23 percent of Republicans. A 2023 Gallup survey found a less extreme but still pronounced party split on EVs, with 54% of Democrats saying they were actively considering purchasing an EV while more than 70% of surveyed Republicans said they never would.
Research has shown that EV ownership is a kind of conspicuous consumption—or as critics might call it, “virtue signaling”—for Democrats, who may feel more social or self-imposed pressure to reduce their personal emissions in a visible way. But the same messaging that tells Democrats that buying an EV is a good thing for the climate may be driving would-be Republican buyers away. Murphy says that the focus on EVs’ impact on the environment, which remains a partisan issue in the US, means that owning an EV is perceived as a political statement, that ""polarizes a significant part of the market” away from EV ownership.
Location demographics may play a role, too, as Democrats tend to be concentrated in cities (where car trips are shorter and less frequent) while Republican voters are more likely to live in rural areas where EV infrastructure is less available. Murphy thinks those motives could change with more new offerings like the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which will come with a range-extender gas engine to complement its electric battery.
For those of us who are paying close attention to the tax credit, history may offer clues to its fate.
In 2017, a Republican plan to overhaul the federal tax code proposed an end to the $7,500 tax credit. The tax plan eventually passed without changes to the incentive. In 2019, then-President Trump proposed a budget that would have eliminated the credit, claiming that doing so would save the federal government $2.5 billion over 10 years. Once again, the credits were safe by the time the budget was passed in August.
During one round of budget negotiations last summer, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives passed a bill that would have repealed certain provisions of the IRA mostly related to renewable energy, though that bill died in the Democrat-majority Senate.
An earlier version of the bill would have repealed even more of the IRA’s spending and incentives, including those for alternative fuel vehicles, but that proposal had been amended by the time votes were cast.
This pattern suggests that while the EV tax credit is a regular target in the federal budget-setting process, it has so far been more a bargaining chip than a sacrificial lamb. Democrats are willing to fight to preserve the credits, while Republicans seem content to let them skate by, even after making a big, public show about ending them.
The fate of the credit will depend not only on who sits in the Oval Office, but on which parties control the House and Senate (and by how much). Anyone predicting who will win those elections today is about as informed as a Magic 8 ball.
The EV tax credit has so far survived with both Republicans and Democrats in the White House, and it was even spared from the chopping block during the period from 2017-2019 when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency. But past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, and an increasingly vitriolic partisan environment could put even relatively benign policies in danger of spiteful repeal.
Still, Trump’s own campaign rhetoric points to support for the goals that underpin these tax credits. During a recent speech in Ohio, the former president railed against the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico and China, and said he would put a 100% tariff on Chinese vehicles manufactured abroad during a second term.
ZETA’s Gore says this bipartisan consensus on energy independence is part of what makes the EV tax credits so strong. “There is an emerging understanding that these credits all work together,” he says, referring to policies that encourage American control of “upstream” elements such as mineral and battery manufacturing and the “downstream” consumer-focused EV credits. “It doesn’t really work to try to lop off the one credit that you don’t like, when the upstream credit that you do like depends on this downstream policy.”

Only The Hyundai Ioniq 6 Has Everything 'Next-Wave' EV Buyers Want: Study,https://insideevs.com/news/713576/ioniq-6-boston-consulting-study/,How do EVs get past early adopters and break into the mainstream? Hyundai's Ioniq 6 may offer some clues.,2024-03-25 09:00:20,"Perception is reality, as they say. In the automotive world, that's never been more true than it is for electric vehicles. While the EV market has grown considerably over the past few years and countless great options are available at many (but certainly not all) price points, many prospective American electric buyers believe there aren't enough options yet that meet all of their needs.
Save for one, right now: the Hyundai Ioniq 6. Give Hyundai's electric ""streamliner"" its flowers, because it may be the spec king of the moment.
The next wave of EV adoption
Nearly all automakers concede the future of cars is electric. But by when, and how? Amid a slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, automakers are figuring out how to roll out new electric models at the right prices while staying profitable with their current portfolios.
That's part of the findings in a new study from the Boston Consulting Group, ""Can OEMs Catch the Next Wave of EV Adopters?"", which was published last week. The firm surveyed 3,000 consumers to figure out what it would take for EVs to break into the mainstream—past the first- and second-wave adopters who have broken up with gasoline over the past decade and change.
The study's authors don't mince words about the challenge of perception vs. reality.
""A narrative has emerged lately that US demand for electric vehicles has hit a wall,"" the study said. ""In reality, EV sales grew 50% in 2023; the problem was that the industry had forecast 70% growth. As a result, inventory piled up and a 'price war' ensued that dominated headlines.""
All of that is true; 2023 was a record year for EV sales in America, and 2024 is expected to see even higher numbers, but at a slower rate of growth than auto executives predicted. (In 2023, electric vehicles made up 7.6% of the U.S. vehicle market, up from 5.9% in 2022.)
""I think what [automakers] were probably doing was taking the historical sales, because things really started to accelerate from 2018 forward into 2022 and 2023,"" Andrew Loh, Managing Director and Senior Partner at BCG, and an author of the study, told InsideEVs in an interview. ""You saw them nearly doubling. It's not like they completely fell off a cliff. It just was lower than expected.""
The study said that slashed production targets, delayed product launches, concerns over resale value, continued charging frustrations and weather concerns have all contributed to a sense of short-term pessimism in the EV market.
But after surveying those consumers and asking them what it would take to go electric, BCG's report said some big jumps in range and charging times—and cheaper pricing—are needed for further adoption. None of that is surprising, but some of their exact requirements might be.
""To convert the next wave of adopters into buyers, OEMs must address these key median requirements: 20-minute charging times; 30-minute detour and wait times for fast-charging stations; a 350-mile driving range; and a price of $50,000,"" the study said. ""They’ll also need to offer greater vehicle variety.
For now, BCG says only one car meets all of those requirements: the Ioniq 6. The Tesla Model 3 is close behind it.
Again, perception is reality; I would add that several other new EVs also excel at meeting mainstream customer needs, perhaps more than these survey respondents even realized. The Tesla Model Y, ostensibly the best-selling car in the world right now, is the best example of this. Even if the Model Y Long Range's EPA-estimated 310 miles of range is below the 350-mile target EV buyers have, Tesla's ubiquitous Supercharger network should offset any range anxiety.
Having said all of that, the BCG study leaves room for optimism in the EV market. While many automakers have slowed down their EV plans, they have not abandoned them entirely. And the next great segment for EVs, the affordable one, has options coming soon; Ford, Kia, Tesla and others are said to be working on cars in the $25,000 range in the coming years.
Moreover, advancements in battery technology seem sure to yield better ranges, more energy efficiency and quicker charging times; each new model hitting the market seems to improve on all of those things. But Loh said car companies have to keep pressing on with improvements to the customer experience and price for sales to hit the mainstream.
""I'd say by the time we're at 2027, 2028, if you have a full portfolio of second-generation vehicles out there, we'd see about 30% market share for EVs,"" Loh said. ""If however, not all those things go right—either because the [automakers] delay some of these launches because they have profitability concerns, or if we start to see consumers falter a little bit and a price war ensues—that can get as low as 20%.""
And that's right when the EV market should really start heating up, thanks to stricter regulations cemented by the Environmental Protection Agency just last week. Those take effect starting with the 2027 model year and get stricter over time through the 2032 model year. The question will be whether automakers, the charging industry and policy decisions can meet that moment.
""With 70% of U.S. consumers stating they would consider buying an EV, the market opportunity is there,"" the study said. ""But will [automakers] and their shareholders overcome the profitability challenges and stay the course with the required investments? Will policymakers and the charging ecosystem step up to the plate? The answers to these questions will determine the pace of the U.S. EV transition.""

"The Fiat 500e, Which Is Only Sold As An EV, Might Get A Gas Engine Option Too",https://insideevs.com/news/713433/fiat-500e-gasoline-conversion-report/,The same EU cybersecurity laws that killed the Porsche Macan will reportedly retire the previous-gen gas-powered 500.,2024-03-22 10:00:56,"The latest generation of the cute Fiat 500 urban hatchback is only available as an electric vehicle–and it’s coming to the United States, too. However, the previous generation that came to life way back in 2007 is still going strong on the Old Continent powered by combustion engines.
But that might change soon, as the European Union’s updated cybersecurity law will reportedly prevent Fiat from selling the almost 20-year-old ICE urban runabout. One possible solution? Convert the new 500e to run on gasoline.
Conversion but the other way around
Usually, when we hear about an EV conversion, it's about an old gasoline-powered car that was modified to run on electricity. But a new cybersecurity law that goes into effect in the European Union this spring might make Fiat go the other way around with the latest generation of the 500 urban hatchback.
While that might seem counterintuitive, seeing how Fiat had its sights set on only offering the new 500 as a battery-powered vehicle, the market reality is that the old, combustion-powered model is still a strong competitor in Europe. According to Jato Dynamics, a little over 170,000 units of the Fiat and Abarth 500 were sold last year in Europe, of which almost 109,000 were gasoline models.
More Fiat Stories
As a result, Fiat sent a letter to its suppliers asking if they could help with an annual production increase of almost 100,000 units at the Mirafiori plant in Italy, according to Il Corriere Della Sera. At the same time, Automotive News Europe, citing some of Fiat’s suppliers, wrote that nearly the entire production increase will be represented by gas cars.
The same cybersecurity law that might affect the previous-gen Fiat 500 prompted Porsche to pull the plug on the gas-powered Macan and 718 in the EU. Those models will still live on in countries where the cybersecurity requirements are more lenient, including the United States, while customers in the EU will get all-electric new generations for both models.
Another option would be to update the old model to comply with the new law, but that might prove to be less cost-effective than converting the EV to run on gasoline. That's because most, if not all of the electric architecture would need to be changed or updated.
Currently, the gasoline Fiat 500 is made in Poland, while the new 500e is made at the company’s iconic Mirafiori plant, on the same assembly line that was used to build the ICE Alfa Romeo MiTo.",Iulian Dnistran

Very much the opposite, said Frank Weber, BMW's management board member in charge of development on a media roundtable this week after the debut of the new Vision Neue Klasse X. That car, its sedan counterpart and the new ground-up EV platform both use are very big deals for BMW, Weber said.
And the company certainly does not plan on losing money on them.
BMW is doing surprisingly well in the EV race
The maker of the Ultimate Driving Machine is still offering combustion vehicles and hybrids, but its EVs tend to overperform on range. Moreover, they made up 15% of BMW's total global sales last year, which is much higher than most rivals. Its next-generation ""New Class"" EVs aim to do even better.
""Once this is in high-volume—which means it's very difficult to have this from the first day on—when everything is in full swing and running at the capacity it was designed for, then you will see margin parity [or] the same profitability level with the combustion engines,"" Weber said.
BMW's Neue Klasse platform and its next-generation technology are designed for that purpose, Weber said. He explained that these projections are expected in the next four years or so, with Neue Klasse production running at ""full volume"" around 2027.
Reaching cost parity and profitability levels on par with gas engines is a major priority of the auto industry as it struggles to transition to a mostly electric future. By some estimates, automakers are, on average, losing around $6,000 on each EV sold at $50,000. Luxury automakers like BMW, Porsche and Audi have fared better thanks to their higher price tags. Meanwhile, even luxury startups have their own challenges of achieving the scale needed to survive long-term.
Weber added BMW's EV profitability goals account for an anticipated cost increase in making combustion engines as well. That's because of ever-stricter environmental rules in the U.S., Europe and China, all of which mean gas and diesel engines have to run more cleanly, a cost increase BMW will have to deal with over time.
""Future emission regulations also will add significant cost to the combustion engine,"" he said.
For now, BMW finds itself in a surprisingly good position to undertake that transition. Its current lineup of EVs, like the BMW i5, i4 and iX, are profitable, a company spokesperson told InsideEVs.
And while it has not committed to an end date for its combustion engines as other automakers have, it has ended production of them at its historic headquarters in Munich and had an extremely successful 2023 on the EV sales front. Last year, BMW pulled off a record 376,183 global electric sales, a relatively high 15% of its total volume.
Meanwhile, Weber said, BMW offers a range of powertrains—combustion, hybrid and EV—in its lineup, and right now that variety approach seems to be working.
""There is a type of uncertainty in the market that we are observing,"" Weber said. ""For us, it is really key that you find the right solution"" for your individual needs, he added.
Even so, the Neue Klasse platform is a quantum leap over BMW's successful current EV offerings. The platform has been developed from the ground up with all-electric vehicles in mind, unlike some current models, and it integrates batteries in the structure of the car instead of placing them on a plate that sits on the floor. It will pack new batteries rated at 75-, 90-, and 105-kWh capacities, as well as an 800-volt electric architecture capable of charging speeds of up to 270 kilowatts—which should make these cars among the quickest-charging ones on the road.
The Vision Neue Klasse X is expected to go on sale in the second half of next year, possibly named the next-generation iX3. BMW officials said it will eventually be built in Hungary, China and Mexico, which should allow it to qualify for EV tax incentives.
The Neue Klasse EVs will use new cylindrical battery cells capable of more energy density, higher range and reduced charging times compared to BMW's current EVs. Moreover, Weber said that the Neue Klasse previews whole new families of technologies that will be seen throughout the BMW product portfolio, including hybrid and gas-powered cars. ""Everything you see on that car ends up in series production,"" he said, which could include more powerful onboard computing, more advanced automated driving functions and potentially other functions.
""The Neue Klasse will renew all the technologies that will be available throughout the BMW product portfolio,"" Weber said. ""It is part of our strategy to make this latest technology available to most of our products in a very, very short period of time.""

High Insurance Costs On Chinese EVs Are Scaring Away UK Buyers,https://insideevs.com/news/713295/high-insurance-uk-chinese-byd/,"Long repair times and parts scarcity are driving up rates, and the high premiums are scaring away buyers.",2024-03-21 13:30:00,"Chinese vehicles may be a hot-button issue in the United States, but they're already taking root in Europe. Automakers BYD, Great Wall Motors, MG, and more have attracted buyers due to pricing, value, and surprisingly good quality, but not all that glitters is gold. But reports from several sources allege that the high insurance costs of new Chinese EVs are scaring off some price-conscious buyers, and the reasons why aren't surprising.
According to CityAm, a UK-based finance outlet, UK insurance companies are facing hardships when it comes to new Chinese vehicles. The outlet cited “A dearth in replacement parts, poor cooperation between insurance firms and Chinese manufacturers and a lack of technical knowledge of the new vehicles,” which in turn is driving up UK drivers’ insurance rates.
EVs Can Be Expensive To Insure
EVs can be more expenisve to repair, with some sources claiming that the average EV insurance claim is around 25% more expensive than a comparable gas-powered car. Also, some EV startups are struggling to meet the demand for replacement parts or supply tradesmen with accurate repair instructions.
This isn’t the only report of this problem, either. Earlier this month, Auto Express honed in on BYD with similar complaints. The BYD Seal may be in the running for the World Car of the Year award, but UK body shops are struggling to repair any BYD in the country.
Auto Express cites similar reasoning: “A lack of understanding about how Europe’s repair market works, and a failure to provide the correct parts and information that would allow cost-effective repairs to be carried out following accidents.”
When these cars are damaged, they can end up with long repair times, as body repair shops wait for replacement parts for repairs that theoretically shouldn’t be all that complicated. In other cases, repairs that would be somewhat routine on any typical European or Japanese brand, have straight-up totaled out a Chinese car. That’s not great news for the insurance rates of Chinese EV models.
Thus, some insurance companies are simply opting not to insure these vehicles at all. When drivers can find insurance, the quotes are far more expensive than a typical gas-powered vehicle of the same size and prestige.
The reputation of EVs being expensive to insure and repair is a global problem. We’ve learned this with Tesla and other brands; batteries are pricy devices that are often unfixable when damaged in an accident, leading the car to become totaled more easily. Also, because of the high-voltage nature of electric vehicles, many technicians must have proper training to perform certain procedures, which inherently means they’re more expensive.
It seems that the new Chinese EV startups have fallen into the same issues that have plagued other brands, albeit prompted by a mismatch in culture. Tesla has only gotten somewhat better in recent times, but it’s still not great. We can’t forget that high repair costs are one of the factors that caused Hertz to drop most Teslas from its EV fleet.
Still, both sources were adamant that there was nothing wrong with the cars themselves. When they’re undamaged, they’re still competent vehicles, and BYD, MG, and Great Wall Motors explained that they were taking steps to better understand how the European market works, and rectify the problems. With some luck, insurance prices will drop down to reasonable levels.

Volkswagen's Cupra Brand Is Coming To The U.S. With Two EVs: CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/713290/volkswagen-seat-cupra-usa/,"By the decade's end, the VW Group will plan a bigger electric U.S. expansion with SEAT's Cupra brand and ""a new distribution model.""",2024-03-21 09:57:34,"If you're an American who's traveled to Europe or Mexico, you might have noticed cars from Volkswagen's SEAT brand. Once an independent Spain-based automaker, SEAT spent years making more stylish, sometimes more competitively priced versions of Volkswagen's cars, which made it a hit in many parts of the world. So much so that SEAT spun off its performance-focused label Cupra into a standalone, sporty, EV-focused brand in 2018. Cupra's cars look much more aggressive than your average VW, but so far, the U.S. hasn't gotten any of that love.
That's going to change in a few years. At SEAT's annual media conference today in Barcelona, Wayne Griffiths, who serves as CEO of both brands, announced that Cupra will debut in the U.S. by the end of this decade with two new all-electric SUVs.
The Volkswagen Group aims to conquer America in a big way
SEAT's Cupra brand, along with the relaunched Scout Motors brand, represent big EV-focused ambitions for the Volkswagen Group in America. The conglomerate is huge in the rest of the world but has long struggled for the same level of mainstream success in the U.S. as other ""imports"" like Toyota and Honda.
""We want to build on our outstanding success in overseas markets,"" Griffiths said. ""But when we talk 'global,' when we say 'bigger,' we mean the United States of America.""
Griffiths said the company had been examining a possible U.S. entry for some time as it seeks more of a worldwide presence, but now it's official. ""We know it's a matter of being well-prepared and doing it right if you go to the U.S., so after testing the brand, we know our cars will reflect what customers are looking for.""
Griffiths said the company plans to start with an electric version of the Formentor crossover, and an as-yet-unnamed ""bigger"" electric SUV. (They really do know the U.S. market, it seems.) The cars will be built at Volkswagen's North American factories, including Mexico, which should qualify them for EV tax credits.
He added that Cupra will launch in key states, and it seems focused on the two coasts and the Sun Belt. And as for sales, Cupra may be up to something interesting here. ""This will be done through a new distribution model,"" he said, but didn't elaborate further.
It's all a very fascinating move from the Volkswagen Group—especially the ""new distribution model"" part of the equation. It is possible Cupra could dip into some form of direct-to-consumer sales like Tesla or Rivian, or some new hybrid system that may work with some established dealers. It remains to be seen how VW's various dealers in America will feel about this, but automakers everywhere are experimenting with new ways to get cars to customers—including, in some cases, as dealers balk at selling EVs.
But the move also fits with the VW Group's more aggressive focus on the U.S. market. While its brands are dominant globally, and Porsche and Audi are both iconic and profitable here, the VW Group as a whole lacks the immense presence it has in Europe and other places. That's a big reason it's launching the new Scout Motors electric truck brand, complete with its own factory in South Carolina. Adding Cupra to that mix with an EV focus will only help to bolster things here.
InsideEVs has reached out to the VW Group for more information and we will update if we learn more.

Subaru Can Do This Or Rivian Can Do It For Them,https://insideevs.com/news/713192/subaru-panasonic-rivian-r3x/,"It's good news that Subaru and Panasonic's battery partnership is taking shape, because Rivian's plans seem ready to take its business.",2024-03-20 17:29:27,"It's good news that Subaru and Japanese electronics giant Panasonic are finally moving forward on their long-awaited lithium-ion battery partnership. Plenty of Subaru loyalists who were drawn to the brand's earthy image, but disappointed in its lack of modern EV offerings, will likely be thrilled to hear that it's doing more than ""nothing"" to prepare for an electrified future. But Subaru's problem is that many of those same loyalists are itching for the day when reservations open up for the Rivian R3 and R3X.
That may sound preposterous on its face. After all, Subaru is a well-established, much-loved brand with a lineup that's affordable, capable and in many cases, quite fun. It sold 632,086 cars in America alone in 2023—up 13.6% from the previous year—and globally, there's no reason to believe it won't report handsome profits when its fiscal year ends this month.
Japan's automakers enter ""crisis mode"" in EV race
Though an early pioneer with cars like the Nissan Leaf, Japan has resisted plug-in cars to focus more on hybrids and hydrogen power. But with China's EV industry rising in the world, it's now scrambling to catch up. Arguably, the ones most behind are smaller players like Subaru and Mazda.
Everything Subaru is doing is fine, for now. It has the new Crosstrek Wilderness coming to the New York Auto Show next week, and that should sell just fine, along with the rest of the lineup that includes no hybrids or EVs that weren't made by Toyota. The little national park stage will be back at the auto show, full of cars powered by Boxer four-cylinder engines.
It's all fine. For now.
Beyond ""for now"" is where things feel tricky for Subaru. It's a latecomer to the electric world, like the rest of Japan's auto industry, spooked by the concept of plug-in cars thanks to natural resource scarcity and a fairly recent nuclear energy disaster. But lately, Japan seems even more spooked by its declining presence in China—where Subaru is barely a player anyway—or the fact that cars from China's BYD are snapping up awards like the Japan EV of the Year.
As of a few weeks ago, Subaru has another problem: the fact that American EV startup Rivian is generating considerable hype (and, in the case of the R2 SUV, reservation dollars) running an electric version of the Subaru playbook. Take a look at the R3, for example. It's a boxy, compact hatchback with SUV-like ride height and available all-wheel-drive from a dual-motor setup.
It looks every bit as capable and outdoor-friendly as any Subaru, ready for adventures on the pavement or off. With prices expected to start around $37,000 before any tax incentives, the R3 seems poised to hit the affordable, mass-volume arena Subaru has long played in.
And that's before we even get to the R3X, which Rivian calls ""a performance variant of R3 offering even more dynamic abilities both on and off-road,"" with a design inspired by the Lancia Delta Integrale and Audi Quattro coupe.
If you don't think that sounds like an electric Subaru WRX or WRX STI, the kind Subaru itself hasn't bothered to make, get your hearing checked.
I'm not the first person to draw the comparisons between Rivian and Subaru. Writing for climate-focused publication Heatmap News recently, writer Andrew Moseman did the same, along with the general disappointment around Subaru's nearly nonexistent electrified game:
Even as its cars became more generic and ordinary in the 21st century, Subie kept its marketing efforts aimed at the outdoorsy, dog-loving folks who had become loyal to the brand. However, while its fans are the kind of people with a clear, vested interest in addressing climate change, the world’s “we love the parks” car company has dragged its toes on joining the electric vehicle revolution that hopes to slash the car industry’s carbon emissions. Subaru’s electric aversion left a giant hole in the market for an adventure EV, one that Rivian seeks to fill.
The same reactions took place on social media too around the time of the Rivian debut event a few weeks ago. After all, the R2, R3 and R3X offer more than we've really ever heard on the electric front from Subaru. All of them look production-ready, even if the R2 isn't even due out until the first half of 2026 (barring any delays, which often happen in the EV world.) We've even seen video of an R3 prototype zooming around California after the event.
All of this is to say: Subaru, where are you on anything electrified?
So far, what we have are vague plans, rumors and announcements. Those include, reportedly, leaning on Toyota yet again for an upcoming three-row electric crossover built in the United States, more hybrids, and ultimately, four all-electric crossovers by the end of 2026. Which is a year and a half away. And all Subaru had to show for itself at the ""don't count us out yet"" Japan Mobility Show last year was a low-slung sports coupe concept and a flying car.
Subaru is out there trying to recreate the SVX, and Rivian has already shown us exactly how it aims to take down the Outback and Crosstrek in the next few years.
Granted, the company has alluded to its future plans in financial documents, especially out of Japan. ""Previously, the 2030 target was for [hybrid electric vehicles] and BEVs to account for at least 40% of our total global sales,"" officials said last August. ""We have now raised the target [for] 50% of Subaru's total global sales to be BEVs, which will be achieved by selling 600,000 BEVs out of our total global sales of 1.2 million-plus Subaru vehicles."" They added, ""On the U.S. side, we plan to start U.S. production of BEVs as well as next-generation HEV models using Toyota Hybrid System (THS) technology."" But we haven't seen anything concrete from Subaru yet beyond announcements, while Rivian is taking pains to show us exactly what it wants to do.
None of this is meant to erase Rivian's own challenges. As our own Kevin Williams reported recently, it remains in the ""Valley of Death"" startup mode until it can ramp up these more mass-volume models. It doesn't even sell cars outside of the United States and Canada, it just hit pause on a new factory in Georgia, it's had to do layoffs to keep costs down, and it will likely rely on the expensive R1S and R1T to stay afloat for years—two vehicles it reportedly loses five figures on each one it sells. And if we're comparing Rivian to Subaru, the latter still sold 13 times as many cars in the U.S. last year alone than the former.
But we've seen what happens when legacy automakers underestimate startups before. The model for disruption exists and it's playing out every day. As Rivian rolls out Tesla Supercharger integration, Subaru offers electrified nothing except for a car another company makes. Given global trends that include pure internal combustion peaking around 2017 and massive investments into battery plants and charging, Subaru has to put up or shut up sooner rather than later. And no, I don't mean flying cars, either.
At this point, Rivian feels like a company that's getting ready for the future. Subaru has some work to do to show its many fans across the world that its future doesn't mean becoming an in-house forklift manufacturer for Toyota.

The EPA’s New Emissions Standards Mean A More Gradual EV Transition,https://insideevs.com/news/713144/epa-announces-new-emissions-standards-evs/,"Experts say the standards are worth celebrating, but they don’t go far enough to meet U.S. obligations towards climate change.",2024-03-20 11:30:00,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the most stringent emissions rules in U.S. history. These regulations promote a shift towards an American car market more dominated by electric vehicles, but implementing these rules would now allow car companies some breathing room.
The move from the EPA marks the final version of emissions rules for light- and medium-duty vehicles sold between 2027 and 2032. In a departure from its initial proposal, the final ruling mandates a more gradual penetration of electric vehicles during the program's early stages.
However, the ultimate goal of serious emissions reductions by 2032 remains in place.
Policy drives the EV transition
In countries where EV adoption has been successful, like Norway and China, policy and government-led push on the demand side made EVs popular and led to emissions reductions. The U.S. is comparatively late to the party, but these are the strictest measures it has ever passed to move away from gas cars.
The initial proposal, which the EPA released in April last year, recommended automakers increase their share of battery-powered EVs to account for two-thirds, or about 67%, of their new passenger vehicle sales by 2032 to meet the CO2 emissions criteria. That proposal got overwhelming support from environmental groups, but staunch opposition from others.
However, after months of lobbying and rebellion from automakers, dealer groups, and petroleum companies—many of whom argued Americans were not ""ready"" for such a drastic change, and neither is the nation's charging infrastructure—the EPA has amended its program.
The amendments consider the challenges automakers are facing in expanding their EV businesses, the considerable time needed to expand the nation's charging infrastructure, and also gives consumers time to cultivate interest and education in EVs.
The EPA's final guidance emphasizes reducing emissions across a brand's entire fleet. For light-duty vehicles the industry-wide average target starts at 170 grams per mile of CO2 emissions by 2027 (as opposed to 152 grams/mile in the initial proposal), gradually reducing to 85 grams/mile by 2032 (instead of 82 grams/mile initially).
The rules also require automakers to significantly slash the number of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter their vehicles emit. Here’s a table comparing the proposal and the final standards from 2027 to 2032:
As you can see, the new standards require less CO2 emissions over time—especially coinciding with more EVs, which have no tailpipe emissions—but aren't as tough as before. Until America gets to 2032, of course, and then we start to see a closer target to the original plan.
Moreover, automakers can choose to sell between 30-56% BEVs as a part of their overall production to meet the emissions targets, according to a fact sheet the EPA shared with reporters—but these exact percentages aren't required, as long as OEMs meet the multi-pollutant criteria.
During a virtual White House briefing with reporters that InsideEVs was a part of, a senior administration official said that the new standards are technology-neutral and that the governing metric is grams per mile, not any particular propulsion type or percentage of BEVs.
With the new standards, the EPA estimates that the average annual fuel savings in 2032 will be about $6,000, and the U.S. will save 14 billion gallons of oil between now and 2055.
Carmakers can choose what percentage of BEVs or PHEVs they want to sell. But to meet the targets, it goes without saying that they would have to ramp up their BEV sales significantly. The EPA estimates that its standards would give the EV market the time it requires to mature.
Still, they will help save about 7.2 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions over the life of the program.
Another senior official said that the Biden administration was confident that the availability of EVs would grow dramatically in the years to come.
Citing J.D. Power's data, he said that 70% of the American public will have an EV available in the price and product category that they typically shop by the end of 2024. That estimate feels a bit overly optimistic, considering the rate of EV adoption is slowing (though the category is growing quickly overall), but many new and affordable models are indeed launching in the next few years.
However, some environment advocacy groups think the EPA’s finalized emissions standards are inadequate.
""The [alternative ruling] will avoid more vehicle pollution and save more lives than we have under current regulations,"" Chelsea Hodgkins, Senior ZEV Policy Advocate at Public Citizen, told InsideEVs in an interview. ""That's important to celebrate. But I think it doesn't go far enough to meet our obligations. The U.S. is the largest historic emitter.""
Hodgkins added that even the EPA’s initial preferred standard would not have helped the U.S. get where it needs to. Citing data from Climate Action Tracker, Hodgkins said the U.S. requires between 95-100% EV penetration by 2030 to keep the planet from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.
“It's hugely problematic because this slow rollout means more gas-powered vehicles on the road. There will also be more hybrids on the road, which from our perspective are gas-powered vehicles with better fuel efficiency,” Hodgkins said. “We want to celebrate progress, but we must acknowledge that this is so much more limited than what we need and it's disappointing that industry pressure is what got us here.""
Consumer insights and data analytics firm J.D. Power indicated that the charging infrastructure was the more urgent matter to address.
“The readiness of the charging infrastructure is well behind the readiness to produce and sell the vehicles. Until this disconnect is resolved, requiring automakers to produce more EVs will not cause consumers to buy more EVs,” Doug Betts, president of the auto division at J.D. Power, told InsideEVs.
Environmental non-profit Sierra Club, on the other hand, which was also lobbying for a stricter standard along with Public Citizen, Tesla, and several other pro-EV groups, had a more positive take on the final rules.
“The Biden administration’s new clean car standards will save lives and money for families,""  Sierra Club’s Executive Director Ben Jealous said. ""With investments from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act underway, these new standards will further help U.S. manufacturers in building American-made and union-built zero-emission vehicles.""
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto industry's main trade group that includes members like Toyota, General Motors, Ford, and pretty much every major automaker that sells cars in the U.S., likely played a significant role in influencing the EPA's final rules. Its main argument was to allow time for the market to shift organically.
“Pace matters. Moderating the pace of EV adoption in 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 was the right call because it prioritizes more reasonable electrification targets in the next few (very critical) years of the EV transition,"" John Bozzella, president and CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation said.
“These adjusted EV targets—still a stretch goal—should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up. It buys some time for more public charging to come online, and the industrial incentives and policies of the Inflation Reduction Act to do their thing,"" he added.
The new emissions standards, with the updated fuel economy rules finalized by the U.S. Department of Energy yesterday, allow brands to sell polluting gas cars for an extended period. The impact of this slower approach will also likely have climate consequences. Regardless, these are the strongest standards the U.S. has ever passed to pivot towards cleaner transportation—a sector that causes the most pollution in the country.
With an impending presidential election, what remains to be seen is whether this new policy will stick through the decade. President Donald Trump, who almost certainly will be the Republican nominee again, worked to roll back EPA emissions standards and has lately vowed to undo the Biden administration's policies if reelected.
At the same time, many car companies are moving forward with their EV plans regardless of regulatory uncertainty. This week alone, Stellantis joined with Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volvo to voluntarily reduce car emissions over time in an agreement with California, which has the power to set its own standards.

The DOE Finalizes New Mileage Rules To Boost EV Sales,https://insideevs.com/news/713025/doe-relaxes-mileage-rules-for-evs/,The DOE updated its methodology to represent the real-world EV economy more accurately.,2024-03-19 14:03:48,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has finalized new rules to estimate the mileage of electric vehicles. The ruling better represents the real-world efficiency of EVs and is expected to help the industry pivot toward an electrified future by facilitating carmakers to sell more EVs.
The proposal required gas-equivalent EV mileage ratings to be slashed by 72% by 2027. That means the petroleum equivalency factor (PEF) was set at 23.2 kilowatt hours per gallon by 2030—something OEMs said was harsh. But the new rules soften that target, and automakers can now gradually phase in their mileage requirements through 2030.
EV Regulation Undergoes A Major Overhaul.
Mileage and emissions rules finalized this week would shape how the EV industry grows through the decade and beyond. The rules are designed to give carmakers more time to adopt EVs, while minimizing penalties, but sharply increasing EV penetration from 2030.
Under the new rules, the PEF is set at 82 kWh/gallon for 2024-2026, and it would gradually reduce to 29 kWh/gallon by 2030 and beyond. This allows U.S. carmakers to build more gas-powered cars through 2030, but still meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, Reuters reported.
Environment groups argued that the previous rules allowed carmakers to offset the fuel consumption of gas cars by selling just a small percentage of EVs.
“The automakers’ free ride is over,” said Pete Huffman, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The old calculation included a multiplier of nearly seven that significantly inflated the calculated fuel economy of EVs. DOE’s final rule phases out the multiplier while updating other data used in the calculation with more current figures.”
Automakers were caught off guard by the initial proposal that an auto industry group said would have resulted in $10.5 billion in penalties for not complying with the proposed fuel economy standards. The final order diminishes the gas-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs by 65% (instead of 72%) through 2030.
The news comes after Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the DOE last year to update how EV fuel economy is calculated, instead of relying on what is a two-decade-old methodology.
In simple terms, the DOE determines equivalent fuel economy values for EVs using urban and highway energy consumption values from EPA test cycles. It then converts combined energy consumption to MPGe. The updated rules would determine the EV economy by factoring in energy consumption, grid efficiency, and long-term energy projections.
The non-profit said that by overstating the MPGe figures of EVs, the previous method of calculation allowed automakers to sell far more gas cars. Sierra Club also said that these mileage requirements are “wholly separate” from the EPA’s final emissions standards due on Wednesday.

"Ford's 'Skunkworks' EV Project Includes $25,000 Truck, Compact SUV: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/712872/ford-skunkworks-project-includes-compact-suv-truck/,"The first model is coming in 2026, and it will be powered by an LFP battery.",2024-03-18 17:52:47,"The fear of affordable Chinese EVs entering the U.S. through Mexico has rattled American carmakers. But it seems like they are finally responding with some countermeasures to the potential onslaught of Chinese EVs.
Remember Ford’s announcement from last month about an internal “skunkworks” team developing a low-cost electric vehicle platform? Some new details have surfaced about this project. Bloomberg reported today, citing an anonymous source, that the new low-cost EV platform will spawn at least three new electric cars: a compact SUV, a small truck, and an EV designed for ride-hail services.
The renewed urgency to build low-cost EVs in the U.S.
China's low-cost EVs have already entered several overseas markets, including Europe and South America. It could potentially be mayhem for the U.S. auto industry if they landed stateside—with local players risking losing business to cheap, well-made Chinese EVs. But some truly American low-cost EVs might finally be on their way.
Here’s what Bloomberg reported today:
Bloomberg Businessweek has learned that this team consists of fewer than 100 people working on a new electric platform to underpin a compact SUV, a small pickup, and, potentially, a vehicle that could be used for ride-hailing, according to one of the people. The first model will arrive in late 2026, starting around $25,000—matching the expected base price of a low-cost EV that Tesla is working on, the person said.
The report added that despite Ford losing as much as $5.5 billion per year on EVs, these new compact electrics must be profitable within a year of going to market—a huge task for the company but one that could easily define its future.
Not surprisingly, Ford’s small EV will be powered by lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells. LFP batteries are generally cheaper to manufacture, have a longer life cycle, and pose fewer environmental and safety risks compared to nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries. However, LFP batteries aren’t as energy-dense as NMC packs. That’s why we typically see them on entry-level models like the standard range rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3 and the entry-level versions of the Mustang Mach-E. The Dearborn automaker is constructing an LFP battery plant in Michigan in partnership with CATL, the world's largest battery maker.
Ford is also exploring other battery technologies to further cut costs, the report said. This rounds out what Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month while announcing the low-cost EV platform. ""All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost, and efficiency, in our EV products. The ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese [automakers],"" he said.
It makes sense for Ford to strike three different segments with one low-cost platform. The one-size-fits-all approach is pretty ubiquitous in the EV era. An electric compact SUV is a no-brainer and would drive sales volumes—Tesla is already working on a rumored $25,000 crossover, or what it internally calls the “Redwood” project. Kia is also said to be working on more affordable electric models like the EV3 and EV2. Any one of them could shake up the EV industry.
Moreover, with rideshare rules increasingly mandating drivers to adopt EVs to meet emissions goals, Ford might not want to leave the opportunity to capitalize on that.
This marks a stark contrast from Ford’s strategy just six years ago. In 2018, Ford deleted small cars from its U.S. portfolio to focus on high-profit margin trucks and SUVs. With EVs, the equation is entirely different. China’s BYD, which surpassed Tesla to become the world’s largest EV maker in 2023, is looking to set up a factory in Mexico, from where it could backdoor cheap EVs into North America. Local players could risk losing business and customers to them.
Currently, Chinese EVs are subject to a 27.5% import tariff and there’s bipartisan support to increase that tariff to 125%. But thanks to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement, cars made in Mexico are tariff-free.
Will the Ford EVs be good enough to take on Tesla and the potential onslaught of Chinese EVs? With China’s stranglehold on the battery supply chain, will they be priced competitively?
Those questions might remain unanswered for a while. But this certainly kicks off a presumably tough battle to build affordable small EVs through the decade.

The EPA May Finalize Tough New Rules To Boost EV Sales This Week,https://insideevs.com/news/712831/tough-new-epa-rules-to-boost-ev-sales/,The ruling is expected to be America’s toughest crackdown on gas car sales while promoting a broader EV adoption.,2024-03-18 11:42:22,"A major regulatory order this week would decide the near-term fate of the electric vehicle movement in the U.S., impacting not only millions of Americans but also how the world’s second-biggest polluting country tackles climate change.
This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is poised to finalize emissions rules that will effectively require a certain percentage—as much as two-thirds by 2032—of new cars to be all-electric, Politico and other outlets have reported in recent days. The ruling could be announced as soon as this Wednesday.
These standards could first loosen the tough EV requirements between 2027 and 2030, but then mandate an aggressive ramping up of EV sales from 2031. In other words, these revised rules would give car companies a bit of a pass on EVs in the short term, while still pushing for a mostly-electric future starting in the next decade.
Pushback against gas cars is about to get serious on a federal level.
The transportation sector accounts for the largest chunk of greenhouse gas emissions annually. Exhaust fumes from gas cars and trucks are directly linked to health hazards. EVs have substantially lower life cycle emissions, which is why a new ruling mandating broader EV adoption in the U.S. is imminent.
The EPA originally proposed stringent federal emissions standards last April. The initial proposal required two-thirds of new light-duty vehicle sales to be electric by 2032, up from about 8% in 2023. It also focused on systemically eliminating criteria pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides from vehicle emissions—all linked to direct health hazards among the masses.
But the agency received a strong rebuttal from dealer groups, car manufacturers, and petroleum companies for its proposal. Many said the U.S. was not ""ready"" for such an aggressive EV push, as prices remained higher than internal combustion cars on average and the nation's charging infrastructure is rather lacking.
On the other hand, environmental and public health advocacy groups overwhelmingly supported the initial ruling.
However, The New York Times reported last month that the Biden administration was considering relaxing the EPA rules after pressure from carmakers. According to one estimate, the alternative ruling that’s likely to pass would require EV penetration rates to reach 32% by 2027, and then increase every year after that, finally reaching 54% by 2030 and 68% by 2032.
As of 2021, the transportation sector was the largest contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., accounting for 29% of total emissions.
From Politico's story:
Those changes track with an alternative regulatory option that EPA explored in last year’s draft that ratchets down emissions limits evenly rather than front-loading them in early years.
Environmentalists at the time mostly shrugged at the prospect of EPA preparing to finalize a rule that would give car companies more time to go electric — potentially creating room for more gas- and diesel-powered cars to be sold through the late 2020s.
Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, told reporters at a briefing Thursday morning that the anticipated final rule would still deliver 95 percent of the draft’s greenhouse gas emission cuts.
“So let’s be clear that it’s a very, very modest change in carbon pollution,” he said.
Regardless of which alternative the EPA finalizes, the new rules would require EV sales to increase substantially from what they accounted for in 2023—just over 8%. That means carmakers would need to offer a broad range of cost-competitive EVs while the charging infrastructure would also need a major boost.
The new standards would also help the U.S. get closer to its commitment of reducing its emissions by 50% by 2030 under the Paris Climate Accords.
Nonetheless, Biden's approach to EVs is already becoming a hot-button issue as he faces a difficult and bitter election rematch against his Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump. Trump has been beating the drum against EVs on the campaign trail in recent weeks, and at a speech in Ohio this weekend, he said there would be a ""bloodbath"" for the auto industry if he was not reelected.

"For Car Companies, It's 'Damned If You, Damned If You Don't' With Investors",https://insideevs.com/news/712804/volkswagen-investors-tesla-dealers/,"Plus, car dealers, who never wanted to sell EVs anyway, are extra down on them lately, and Tesla settles a racial discrimination lawsuit.",2024-03-18 09:40:02,"For the past few decades, especially in America but increasingly everywhere, the prevailing culture in business has been the emphasis on short-term results: quarterly returns in particular, agnostic of things like long-term planning and the need for intense research and development investments to get ready for the future. There are exceptions to this, of course, especially in the tech world (though that's been less true as of late.)
But the established car industry is facing a hell of a time convincing investors they can get ready for an electric tomorrow, all while delivering those quarterly and annual financial results investors demand right now. And Volkswagen is emerging as a good case study in that trend, whether it's fair or not.
That kicks off Monday's Critical Materials tech and transportation news roundup. Also on tap today: car dealers bristle even more at selling EVs, and Tesla settles an infamous racial discrimination case.
I'll start this off by sharing a Wall Street Journal article published after Volkswagen's annual conference in Berlin last week, which I also attended. Here's how it starts out:
Volkswagen is the archetypal legacy automaker: flabby, slow-moving and valued as if it is going out of business.
First of all, damn. That's how you write a lede, folks. It's a little too scathing and represents a conclusion I don't agree with—which we'll get to—but it speaks to how investors view things at VW right now.
Most investors don't think very highly of so-called ""legacy"" automakers, which have low profit margins, intense overhead costs and had their viability tested during the Great Recession. Hence the headline on this story, ""Why Volkswagen Is Priced For Failure.""
Ouch, right? This, even as VW reported a $19.6 billion net profit for 2023, up 13% from 2022, alongside double-digit sales increases in Europe and North America. A bigger problem is the slowing market in China, which is why VW issued a much more cautious outlook for 2024.
But the VW Group's valuation remains quite low, even with highly profitable brands like Porsche, Bentley and Audi in its portfolio. Example:
There are more conventional signs of undervaluation, too. VW stock trades at less than four times forward earnings. Toyota, its only peer in scale and global reach, is at 10 times. Chrysler-owner Stellantis, which long traded at a discount even to VW, is now at five times after a stellar 2023.
VW’s results offered plenty of reminders why many investors stay clear of the company. Most simply, it made a net profit of €17.9 billion in 2023, equivalent to $19.6 billion. While that is roughly twice what General Motors earned, it could be much better. In rough terms, Toyota expects to make 50% more net profit for its financial year through March, even though it sold only 20% more vehicles than VW in 2023.
Here's where the ""damned if you do, damned if you do"" part comes in.
The company is throwing money at the problem, both at new EV partners such as XPeng and at its own Chinese operations. This has long been VW’s knee-jerk response to challenges, which doesn’t help investors gain confidence that the company will earn acceptable returns.
Its research and development and capital expenditures combined will amount to a gargantuan 14% of revenue this year at the midpoint of guidance, which it insists will be the peak. By comparison, Toyota expects to spend half as much in its current financial year.
That is because VW is a company that's committing to an all-electric future and openly saying its current internal combustion engines will be its last—something it's said for almost a decade now. It hasn't gotten the EV transition exactly right (no ""legacy"" company has, yet) but it's listening to consumer critiques, growing its EV market share and getting ready to face a raft of electric competitors everywhere, including from China. That's where the ""gargantuan"" research and development and capital expenditures come from.
Again, VW isn't alone here. Ford has the same problem, especially since it breaks out the financial results for its EV division separately and that operation is burning cash as it ramps up operations.
Pivoting to be a battery- and software-powered business is a massively costly and complex effort, but if these car companies don't, they're dead in time. So what do investors want here? Returns right now, or a future? The answer, more and more, seems to be ""both,"" which may not be rooted in reality.
But there's also this:
Investors gravitate to “specific stories” in the embattled auto sector, such as Toyota’s hybrid leadership or the best-in-class cost discipline of Stellantis, says Federated Hermes portfolio manager Dariusz Czoch. Viewed through this lens, VW doesn’t offer much apart from a slow and complex turnaround story, variations of which investors also heard from previous CEOs.
Maybe that's part of VW's problem here—the ""story"" it's telling. What makes it different from every other car company out there that's working on batteries, software and better and cheaper EVs?
Toyota's hybrid story is a good one, for now, but it too is said to be scrambling to ramp up EV investments behind the scenes. In the end, the EV race is going to be a long-haul fight, and maybe investors would do well to get used to that idea.
When you look at the narratives around the so-called ""EV slowdown,"" a lot of that comes from the longer amounts of time the cars spend on dealership lots. But I have often wondered if this is a sign of demand, or of car dealers just being bad at their jobs. Many (but certainly not all) dealers have spent years resisting the EV transition, bristling at the costs involved with charging and not wanting to miss out on revenue from ICE repairs.
But in 2024, they're especially down on EVs, according to a Cox Automotive survey reported by Automotive News:
Dealers' sentiment around EV sales is worsening from a year ago and sinking to record lows, according to Cox Automotive's first-quarter Dealer Sentiment Index, which surveyed 546 franchised and 472 independent retailers from Jan. 30 to Feb. 13.
The survey results show that the EV ""thrill is gone,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive. ""You have to hunt to find the dealer that's optimistic about the EV market growing.""
To calculate the score, Cox asked: ""Compared to last year, how would you describe your EV sales?"" Sentiment for franchised dealers sunk to 43 from 58 a year earlier on a 100-point scale, the lowest score since the question was added in the second quarter of 2021. The score fell 7 points from the fourth-quarter score of 50. A score of 50 is neutral. Scores above that signify strength or growth, while scores below indicate weakness or decline.
Also, this:
A Honda dealer in the Midwest also pointed to dwindling demand. ""The early-adopter audience is exhausted, and it's a tough sell to the general car buyer in many of our markets,"" the dealer said. ""Prices are too high for the inconveniences presented by switching to EV.""
I find this funny coming from a Honda dealer, which sells one (1) EV that is made by General Motors and is also not on sale yet. Sure, man!
But admit it: there is some truth to this. The EV market is moving past the first- and second-wave adopters. Now it needs to break into the mainstream, and that means more affordable and more normal cars everywhere, not just $60,000 SUVs. At some point, the dealers are going to have to get over themselves too, though.
For all its many efforts to advance the EV space, Tesla has never been known as a great place to work, especially if you're a woman and/or a person of color. The Fremont factory in particular has been dogged with countless lawsuits and complaints over working conditions, racial and sexual harassment and abusive managers. (I'd point you to an episode of Vox's Land of the Giants podcast I wrote last year about this very topic, if you want to hear from those inside.)
Now, Tesla has settled one of its most infamous cases, with Black worker Owen Diaz. Here's The Guardian:
Tesla has settled with a former employee in a long-running discrimination case that drew attention to the electric vehicle maker’s treatment of people of color.
The case, which dates back to 2017, centers on allegations that Tesla didn’t take action to stop a racist culture at the factory located about 40 miles (65km) south-east of San Francisco. Diaz, a Black man, alleged he was called the N-word more than 30 times, shown racist cartoons and told to “go back to Africa” during his roughly nine-month tenure at Tesla that ended in 2016.
The same Tesla plant is in the crosshairs of a racial discrimination case brought by California regulators. Tesla has adamantly denied the allegations made in state court and lashed back by accusing regulators of abusing their authority. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a similar complaint against Tesla in September.
Remember, two years ago, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will ""never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose.”
I also bring this up here because a rising United Auto Workers union is pondering its next targets after huge wins with the Big 2.5 in Detroit. Will the UAW use this longstanding, well-documented history of worker mistreatment as fodder for another union drive?
There's no bigger target when you think about it.
If you're a company like Volkswagen, and you think you're trying to do the right things even if they don't always succeed at first, what story do you tell?

"Electric Volkswagen GTI For The U.S.: 'I Think The Car Would Sell,' CEO Says",https://insideevs.com/news/712634/volkswagen-id2-gti-usa-sales/,Volkswagen's American CEO Pablo Di Si tells InsideEVs about the possibility of the ID.GTI coming stateside.,2024-03-15 15:30:09,"When the Volkswagen ID.GTI Concept debuted last year, it gave fans all over the world some hope that the legendary hot hatchback would survive to be part of the automaker's all-electric future. But that also depends on whether the actual EV, slated to go on sale later this decade as the ID.GTI, will make it to one of the countries that loves the GTI the most: the United States.
The good news is that Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si is as enthusiastic as anyone about that proposition. ""I loved it,"" he told InsideEVs in an interview this week. ""It's a beautiful car. I think it would sell in America. I think it has potential. It's a 'love vehicle' in the U.S.""
The bad news is bringing it stateside may be easier said than done. Whether the ID.GTI can be priced correctly for the U.S. is an open question.
Volkswagen tweaks its all-electric future
Volkswagen has committed to going all-electric in the coming years, while adding more hybrids to its portfolio in the meantime. The ID.GTI concept made a huge splash when it was unveiled last year, but whether it's sized and priced right for the American market is an open question—as is what will happen to the legendary GTI itself in the EV future.
The production version of the ID.GTI Concept has been greenlit for arrival in 2026. The car it is based on, the Volkswagen ID.2, may not make it to our shores. Last year, a VW spokesperson said it wouldn't, and Di Si himself told Car and Driver that it's probably not the right size for U.S. buyers.
Despite its decidedly Golf-like looks, the ID.2 is quite a bit smaller than the current Golf. It's a little closer in size to the subcompact Polo. And American buyers have certainly not been in the habit of buying Golfs in volume like the rest of the world. With the discontinuation of the U.S.-market Golf in 2021, the only variants now sold here are the GTI and the more powerful Golf R.
You can thank those cars' rabid fanbase for that decision. Even as Volkswagen has pivoted heavily to crossovers and SUVs to meet market demand in the U.S.—they make up the bulk of VW's current American portfolio, including the lone EV for now—the GTI and Golf R have a dedicated enthusiast car culture surrounding themselves. The GTI is credited as being the original hot hatchback, and whether it's slammed to the ground or just a bone-stock daily driver, their mix of speed and practicality has made it an iconic gearhead staple on par with the Mazda Miata, Ford Mustang and BMW M3.
And while the ID.GTI's specs haven't been released yet, the ID.2all concept was said to put down 223 horsepower to the front wheels. The ID.GTI will certainly pack a bigger punch, making it more powerful and likely faster than any gas-powered GTI.
So while Di Si wouldn't confirm the ID.GTI for the U.S., he's thinking about what levers could be pulled. ""It would make sense if we hit the price points,"" he said. The company wants a volume-player EV priced around $25,000, Di Si said. If it goes too high, he said it's too much of a ""niche vehicle."" (The current gas-powered GTI starts at around $32,000.)
""Do we have a plan? Not yet, but it is on our radar,"" Di Si said. ""The majority of the cost comes from the batteries.""
Electric performance cars are clearly on Volkswagen's radar in general. This week, the automaker also unveiled the ID.3 GTX, a 321-horsepower variant of its Golf-like electric ID.3, as well as the ID.7 GTX Tourer, a go-fast wagon with 335 hp.
Yet while the ID.3 GTX seems like a shoo-in to take up the GTI's mantle, the ID.3 isn't sold in the U.S. at all. And then there's the question of what's going to happen with the future Golf itself, which is also slated to go electric-only on a new platform.
But that's further down the line. The ID.GTI should be on sale before then, and it would be a shame if American fans had to wait so long for some new electric Golf GTI to appear. Clearly, the ID.GTI is a hype machine already, and with more and more Americans asking for affordable EVs—and even smaller ones—it feels like not bringing this EV hot hatch stateside would be a real misfire.
Let's put it this way: If Dodge can bring somehow the Charger into the electric era, surely Volkswagen can figure this one out.

Tesla’s Official India Entry Almost Confirmed Under New EV Policy,https://insideevs.com/news/712599/india-approves-new-ev-policy-clears-way-for-tesla/,Tesla has been lobbying the Indian government to reduce its punitive import taxes for months.,2024-03-15 15:00:20,"A major regulatory roadblock has been cleared for Tesla as it plans to expand its presence in South Asia. India, the world’s third-largest passenger vehicle market behind China and the U.S., has agreed to lower its punitive tariffs on certain imported electric vehicles, its commerce ministry announced today.
India imposes up to a 100% import duty on cars manufactured overseas. That means the standard range Tesla Model 3, which starts at $38,990 in the U.S. would cost over $77,000 in India under the current regulations.
Tesla always wanted to go global.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed his desire to expand the automaker's presence globally several times. At one point Musk also wanted to enter Russia, but later called off that operation due to the war in Ukraine. Outside the U.S., Tesla has plants in Berlin and Shanghai. A Mexico gigafactory is under construction and now India just cleared a big regulatory hurdle for the automaker to enter.
These rules have now been relaxed for electric cars as long as automakers invest at least $500 million in local manufacturing. This threshold is much lower than what Tesla was earlier ready to commit, about $2 billion if import taxes were lowered for the first few years.
Asia’s third-largest country will lower import tariffs to 15% if certain conditions are met. They include setting up a local manufacturing facility in three years and reaching 50% “domestic value addition” in five years—to promote localization at an increasing rate in that timeframe.
Only 8,000 EVs would qualify for the lower 15% import tariff annually, and automakers will have to back up their investment with a bank guarantee, the commerce ministry said. Local players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have been lobbying against this move, fearing hurting their own businesses.
But the commerce ministry said that the new rules would “strengthen the EV ecosystem by promoting healthy competition among EV players leading to high volume of production, economies of scale, lower cost of production, reduce imports of crude oil, lower trade deficit, reduce air pollution, particularly in cities, and will have a positive impact on health and environment.""
""It's quite likely that there will be a significant investment relationship with India in the future. Tesla will be in India as soon as humanly possible,"" CEO Elon Musk said last year in New York City where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived for an official state visit. The two also met on the sidelines and courted each other to build a partnership.
According to IQAir data, six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities are Indian. Just like the U.S., India’s transportation sector emits a big chunk of its total carbon emissions.
However, India says this policy isn’t targeted at any one particular company. ""We invite global companies to come to India. I'm confident India will become a global hub for EV manufacturing and this will create jobs and improve trade,"" Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters at a press briefing, Reuters reported.
Tesla already has an office in India in the city of Pune (which also happens to be yours truly’s hometown), but now it would need a strong management team on the ground to clear the local regulatory steps and accelerate its manufacturing goals.
It's unclear which models Tesla will initially import to India and later manufacture. But the smallest and the cheapest would make the most sense, like the Model 3 and the Model Y, and also the upcoming ""Redwood"" project, which is rumored to be called the Model 2.
Three years to build a plant may seem adequate, as Tesla got Giga Shanghai up and running in just ten months—that plant is Tesla’s largest globally by manufacturing capacity. Beyond the U.S. and China, Tesla also has a factory in Berlin, and another one is under construction in Mexico.
However, Elon Musk’s company has a limited presence in the BRICS nations, apart from China of course. India, the world’s most populated country with over 1.4 billion people, has a burgeoning middle class, and a booming tech industry. If its India plant ever materializes, it could become an export hub as several global tech giants look for a ""China plus-one"" strategy in Asia.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the Tesla Model 3's U.S. price. The Model 3 starts at $38,990 as of March 15, 2024. $33,990 is after probable tax credits.

Nissan And Honda Confirm They Want To Work Together On EVs,https://insideevs.com/news/712514/nissan-honda-ev-partnership-official/,The two Japanese automakers signed a memorandum of understanding today.,2024-03-15 09:30:57,"Well, that was fast. Yesterday we wrote about the possibility of Nissan and Honda teaming up in one way or another to develop electric vehicle tech together, and now the two companies have confirmed what was initially reported by Nikkei Asia.
The Japanese automakers signed a memorandum of understanding for a feasibility study of a strategic partnership in the fields of vehicle electrification and intelligence, a joint press release published today shows.
Honda looks at Nissan for EV help after ditching plans with GM
Nissan and Honda are officially looking to work together on electric vehicles. The two Japanese companies signed a memorandum of understanding for a feasibility study today.
In other words, the two companies won’t start working together on a brand-new EV just yet, but if they find common ground during this feasibility study, they’ll collaborate on software development, core components related to EVs (like batteries), and complementary products, the release said.
More Stories Like This
Yesterday’s report from Nikkei Asia mentioned that Nissan was weighing a partnership with Honda to jointly develop a new electric axle (e-axle), as well as a shared EV platform. If this happens, we might see different EVs from the two Nippon manufacturers that sit on the same architecture, much like General Motors is using its Ultium platform for all its new battery-powered vehicles.
Speaking of Ultium and GM, Honda had a deal with the American auto giant that resulted in the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX all-electric crossovers. The partnership should have continued until at least 2027 and was supposed to give birth to at least one affordable EV, but that plan was scrapped.
Now, Honda might do with Nissan what couldn’t be done with GM. Both Japanese names have multiple new EVs in the works, including sedans and SUVs, but they’re still at least two years away from becoming reality. As it stands today, Nissan sells the Leaf and Ariya in the United States, while Honda has the GM Ultium-based Prologue and Acura ZDX at dealerships.",Iulian Dnistran
"Volkswagen Is Expanding Its EV Lineup, But Not The EV Price War",https://insideevs.com/news/712429/vw-ceo-prices-id7-buzz/,"The VW Group's American CEO weighs in on the ID. Buzz, the ID.7, and why fire-sale price cuts aren't in the cards.",2024-03-14 13:00:43,"By the end of this year in the United States, Volkswagen's lone all-electric offering will be joined by a sleek, long-range sedan and a retro-throwback van with three rows of seats. But those EVs won't be bringing a 2023-style price war with them.
That's according to Pablo Di Si, the CEO of the Volkswagen Group of America. “What we said last year was value over volume,” Di Si said. “That doesn't mean that we don't care about market share. That means that we're going to take a balanced approach.""
The Volkswagen Group goes all-electric, but not without headaches
After its mid-2010s diesel cheating scandal, the Volkswagen Group—which includes VW, Audi, Bentley, Porsche and more—vowed to go all-electric in the coming years. But software headaches, production issues and profitability challenges have all rendered that goal easier said than done, for now.
Di Si sat down to discuss a wide range of topics with InsideEVs this week in Berlin during the conglomerate's annual press conference and investor report. Those included plans for the upcoming ID.7 sedan and ID. Buzz van, both due on sale later this year.
In the U.S., Volkswagen has joined the price-cut party as well, but it mostly hung out in the back and left after just one drink. ""We have adjusted the pricing on the ID.4 recently, but we have not been as aggressive as other competitors,” Di Si said.
VW North American CEO Pablo Di Si
""Aggressive"" is an accurate way to put it. Starting with a series of rapid-fire cuts from Tesla early last year, several automakers selling EVs—including Ford, Lucid, Rivian and others—also dropped prices to stay competitive. Others have done so more covertly by offering super-cheap lease deals and discounts at dealerships.
Those moves have helped drive electric adoption in America to a record-breaking 8% of the overall market, but they made already-elusive profits from EVs even harder to attain. And worse, those moves tanked the resale values of many electric models.
But Di Si, a straight-talking Argentinian native who previously ran the VW Group's operations in South America, said he's happy with how last year went for the ID.4. He has good reason to be, too. Despite a somewhat rocky initial launch, the ID.4 has been an objective hit. The crossover netted 37,789 U.S. sales in 2023, up roughly 40% year-over-year making up an impressive 11.5% of Volkswagen's total volume.
And that’s all before the ID.4 got serious new upgrades to power, range and software, including over-the-air updates—something Di Si called “a pain in the neck” to implement. The ID.4’s quality is also now “significantly better” than when it launched, he added.
“The first two months went down a little bit to 7.5% EV penetration for the industry [in January and February], but we remain higher,"" he said. ""Now we need to build volume.”
""Value over volume"" has been a mantra at the VW Group since last year, when the world's second-largest carmaker committed to rejuvenating profits for mainstream brands like Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda, while still eventually going all-electric. Some EVs from its luxury brands, like those in the Audi lineup, are already profitable; others, like the newly all-electric Porsche Macan, are going up in price in exchange for vastly increased performance.
Globally, the Volkswagen brand is struggling a bit with slowing sales in China and weaker-than-expected demand for the compact ID.3. But the automaker has said it expects to correct this over time, including with the launch of the upcoming compact ID.2, which aims to be profitable with a starting price of about 25,000 Euros ($27,209 at today's exchange rate). The company also expects that the revived Scout Motors truck brand will help turn things around, with EVs that will be designed and built in America for the American market.
Di Si said volume is coming in the next few years for VW in the U.S. with a larger electric SUV, “which is in our plans."" Presumably, he referred to the three-row ID.8. Until that arrives, the next move is what Di Si calls “halo cars”: the ID. Buzz and ID.7 sedan.
Pricing hasn’t been announced on either one yet, but the ID.7 is expected to start in the $50,000 range, while the ID. Buzz remains anyone’s guess. (The van America gets is a larger, more upscale cousin of the European one, and it has a bigger battery with more range and more power.) Sedan sales in America haven’t been great for years, and as fun and capable as the ID. Buzz seems to be, electric vans are unlikely to unseat crossovers anytime soon.
Instead, they’re meant to “elevate” a brand that has often struggled to find its identity in the U.S. market despite dominance elsewhere, Di Si said.
“It’s a premium car, with premium touch and feel and great range and great infotainment,” Di Si said of the ID.7, which is already shaping up to be one of the longest-range electric cars on the market. “Is it going to sell a lot of vehicles from a value point of view? Probably not. Obviously, I’d like to sell as many ID.7s as I can, right? But from a marketing point of view, I need to be realistic.”
The ID. Buzz is a slightly different story. Though it’s been in the works since 2017, the hype around it remains palpable.
“I think we're going to have a really good problem because the demand is going to be far, far ahead of supply,” Di Si said. And it will likely get people into Volkswagen dealerships, where they may end up driving away in one or something else.
The strategy around these cars also speaks to how much EV tax credits drive decisions these days. Both EVs are imports from Germany, which means they will only qualify for tax credits if they’re leased. Volkswagen actually lucked out by building the ID.4 at its Chattanooga, Tennessee plant; it remains the only “foreign” brand in America to offer full tax credits when purchased or financed.
But even if demand for the ID. Buzz ends up booming, it’s unlikely Volkswagen will find a way to build it in Tennessee, a factory Di Si said is already “at capacity” with what it can do.
“We’ve been discussing this a lot internally and with our dealer council,” he said. “The key here is to keep the product alive after a year, after two years, you need to bring innovation—new concepts, new variants. I think the setup is correct in Hannover, that's where they have the expertise.”
The upgraded ID.4 will have to hold down the fort for a while. The ID.7 is expected to go on sale in the late third quarter of this year, while VW is targeting November for the ID. Buzz.

"Global Passenger EV, Hybrid Battery Market Expanded 40% In 2023",https://insideevs.com/news/712261/global-passenger-xev-battery-market-2023/,The combined battery deployment reached roughly 690 gigawatt-hours.,2024-03-14 09:00:43,"The global passenger xEV (BEVs, PHEVs, HEVs) battery market continued to expand quickly in 2023, partially thanks to record vehicle sales and partially because the average battery capacity is increasing.
According to Adamas Intelligence in 2023, about 689.2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery capacity was deployed onto roads globally in all newly sold passenger xEVs. That's about 40% more than a year ago, the company estimates.
690 GWh of batteries in 2023
One gigawatt-hour (GWh) of battery capacity is 1,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) or 1,000,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh). 690 GWh deployed in 2023 means that on average, almost 1.9 GWh was deployed each day—that's equivalent to almost 19,000 battery packs (100 kWh each).
Let's recall that passenger plug-in electric car registrations increased in 2023 by 35% year-over-year to almost 13.7 million units. All-electric cars represent the highest share of battery deployment, followed by plug-in hybrids. Non-rechargeable hybrids are also contributing to the total number, but to a smaller degree because their battery packs are usually relatively small.
We do not expect the battery market to slow down but rather continue its growth towards higher records. However, it's not certain that we will see a 1 terawatt-hour (TWh) level (1,000 GWh) this year.
Battery capacity deployed onto roads globally (newly sold passenger xEVs):
Adamas Intelligence also noted that the 2023 volume alone is worth 37% of all battery capacity ever deployed. 2023's 690 GWh is more than the volume deployed in eight years, from 2014 and 2021 combined.
While close to 200 brands contributed to the total result, only 16 managed to exceed 10 GWh, while two—Tesla and BYD—were above 100 GWh.
Tesla deployed 132.1 GWh of batteries, according to the report, 37% more than a year ago. BYD achieved 101.6 GWh (up 51% year-over-year), despite selling more cars (3 million units) because it's heavy on plug-in hybrids (about half of the volume).
The China-focused GAC Aion was the best of the rest with 31.1 GWh (up 75%), slightly ahead of Volkswagen, which deployed 30.3 GWh (up 21%). BMW was fifth with 29.1 GWh (up 76%).
It's worth noting that the wider Volkswagen Group, with all its brands, exceeded 50 GWh in 2023, so it seems that it was the third top automotive group.
Top brands (year-over-year change):
In terms of the growth rate, the Chinese Li Auto almost tripled its battery deployment, by selling a lot of extended-range electric vehicles (EREV). Toyota is also starting to take off, more than doubling its result in 2023. The Japanese company might do it again in 2024, and leapfrog some smaller brands.

Honda Might Team Up With Nissan For Cheap EV After Ditching Plans With GM,https://insideevs.com/news/712353/nissan-honda-cheap-ev-plans-report/,"Nissan is looking for a partner to make a new modular electric axle and EV platform, and Honda might fit the bill, Nikkei reported.",2024-03-14 08:30:26,"Nissan, the maker of the Leaf and Ariya all-electric vehicles, is reportedly weighing a partnership with Honda that could result in the joint development of a new modular electric axle (e-axle), as well as a shared EV platform, according to Nikkei Asia quoting sources at Nissan.
The threat of cheap Chinese EVs prompts Japanese companies to explore partnerships
Nissan is reportedly talking to Honda to partner for a new electric axle and potentially a joint electric vehicle platform that could result in several affordable EVs that could compete with Chinese-made rivals. However, Nikkei Asia reported that the discussions are still in the early stages.
Currently, Honda Motor has two EVs on sale in the United States, the Honda Prologue and the Acura ZDX, both of which are the result of the Japanese automaker’s partnership with General Motors.

The two battery-powered crossovers are based on GM’s Ultium platform, the same that’s used for the Chevrolet Blazer EV. The partnership between Honda and the American carmaker was supposed to continue until at least 2027 and result in the debut of several budget-minded EVs, but that plan was scrapped late last year.
Now, Honda might team up with its Japanese counterpart to make cheaper EVs a reality. That said, Nikkei writes that the discussions within Nissan are still in their infancy, while Honda’s stance on the partnership is unclear.
The sources quoted by Nikkei said that the two companies may discuss joint battery procurement and vehicle development so that the cost of future EVs goes down enough to compete with Chinese rivals such as BYD, which saw a big rise in deliveries last year, thanks in no small part to its ability to source components like batteries in-house, bringing down the final price.
Honda is planning on releasing at least two brand-new EVs starting in 2026 that will draw inspiration from its latest futuristic concepts, while Nissan is working on a couple of U.S.-made EVs. These were supposed to go into production next year, but they were reportedly pushed to 2026 and 2027 respectively.

Volkswagen Group Reaffirms Internal Combustion Will Be 'Phased Out' Eventually,https://insideevs.com/news/712197/vw-group-new-models-2024/,"Plus, Ford and Tesla get nailed for driver-assistance systems, and when it comes to ""software-defined cars,"" you ain't seen nothin' yet.",2024-03-13 08:30:37,"You can sum up the last few years in the automotive industry with four words: ""Easier said than done."" That applies to just about every car company with big (or small) dreams for electric, connected and increasingly automated vehicles. The Volkswagen Group, the original ""pivot to electric vehicles"" automaker following its diesel emissions cheating scandal a decade ago, truly embodies this challenge.
It's made tremendous strides to become a company that's ready for the rest of the 21st century, but not without massive headwinds on multiple fronts. Now, after strong sales and profits in 2023, it's preparing the biggest ramp-up of new products its family of brands has ever seen. That move is underpinned by a lot of new EVs—and some flexibility during ""the transition,"" too.
That kicks off this midweek edition of Critical Materials, our morning news roundup. Also on today's dance card: Tesla, Ford and other automakers get nailed for their driver assistance systems, and the software-driven vehicle revolution hasn't even really gotten started yet.
I'm in Germany this week for the Volkswagen Group's Annual Conference, which isn't just a deep-dive into the conglomerate's 2023 financial results but a look at what's coming next. CEO Oliver Blume, who has been in the top spot since 2022, reaffirmed today that what the Germans often call ""electro-mobility"" is the future of the entire company.
It's coming off a good year to keep that momentum going. In 2023, the VW Group saw deliveries rise 10% globally with an operating profit of €22.6 billion (about $25 billion.) But converting the world's second-largest automaker—one whose portfolio of brands stretches from bargain-basement Skodas and VWs to six-figure Lamborghinis and Bentleys—into a battery-powered business, while staying alive to do it, is far from easy.
Besides the massive costs of ramping up battery and EV production and delays of key products due to software woes, the VW Group is facing a volatile Chinese market, uneven EV demand in the U.S. and Europe, a lackluster charging network basically everywhere, persistent post-COVID supply chain issues and rising interest rates.
Those are not unique challenges. But the VW Group's answer, Blume and his executives said today, is to charge forward with new models. ""2024 will indeed be a record year when it comes to new products,"" he said. ""We are gearing up for the biggest product offensive in the history of the Volkswagen Group... planning to debut over 30 new models across all brands this year.""
Blume added, ""We have already announced some of the new models: the Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer, the ID.Buzz Long Wheel Base, the Volkswagen Golf, the Skoda Octavia, the Cupra Tavascan, the all-electric Porsche Macan, and the Audi Q6 e-tron."" More are coming, including the ID.2—an electric quasi-Golf replacement projected to cost around €25,000—and more announcements yet to come.
Then there's more talk of ""the transition"" that wasn't as prevalent when VW was making those all-electric commitments post-Dieselgate. Those include more plug-in hybrids, which it is doing more of, like the new Tiguan PHEV in Europe.
But most interestingly of all, VW execs continue to say the current crop of engines and whatever electrified variants they get is about to be it for that technology.
""We will invest in our last-generation of ICE vehicles,” which are especially key for hybrids, board member and CFO Arno Antlitz said today. Then, he said, “These investments are going to be phased out.”
We'll have more on this event throughout the week on InsideEVs, including from reporter Tim Levin, who's getting a similar preview of what's next from Audi.
Semi-autonomous driving assistance systems like Tesla's Autopilot are said to lay the groundwork for a future much more driven by eventual self-driving cars. But do they really provide a tangible safety benefit to drivers right now?
The answer, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, is not really, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Car companies have been introducing more so-called partially automated driving systems, which control the vehicle’s steering and speed in certain situations, and sometimes allow hands-free driving. The study, released Tuesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, gave a “poor” rating to 11 of 14 systems it tested, concluding that most lack adequate measures to prevent drivers from losing focus on the road.
“Some drivers may feel that partial automation makes long drives easier, but there is little evidence it makes driving safer,” said David Harkey, IIHS president. “As many high-profile crashes have illustrated, it can introduce new risks when systems lack the appropriate safeguards.”
Only Toyota Motor’s Lexus brand earned an “acceptable” rating in the study, for its Teammate feature on the LS sedan, the industry-funded nonprofit group said. Two models received “marginal” ratings: General Motors’ GMC Sierra pickup truck, and Nissan Motor’s Ariya electric SUV.
Driver-assistance features on models from Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz and BMW were given poor grades.
I'm particularly surprised to hear that Ford's BlueCruise got such a bad grade here. In my experience, it's quite good at navigating mapped highways while aggressively noticing when a driver isn't minding the road.
But I think that's part of the problem, right? These systems are, for now, a new and novel way of ""driving"" that's often poorly understood by a public often struggling to understand new tech systems in cars. That's no excuse for systems that feel objectively unsafe at times—Tesla's Full Self-Driving tried to drive me into oncoming traffic twice, and that certainly hurt my feelings—but proper education is a key part of this too.
Finally, I'll leave you with this from Wards Auto. When it comes to the software-defined vehicle—you know, a networked vehicle with advanced autonomy, constant over-the-air updates, subscription features and more—the industry has barely scratched the surface of what it wants to do.
Unsurprisingly, a survey of global automotive executives conducted by chipmaker NXP Semiconductors and Wards Intelligence finds that nearly 60% of the industry believe it will be beyond 2030 before more than half of the new vehicles sold annually in mature markets are software-defined.
[...] The challenges faced by OEMs in deploying OTA updates and upgrades in existing platforms, mainly due to legacy electrical/electronic architecture, monolithic software and limited control over the supply chain (as electronic control units are often vertically designed by Tier 1 suppliers), have driven OEMs to move toward the development of their own automotive software stacks.
Worth a read in full, because that's going to be as key to the future of cars as batteries are, in many ways.
The whole group, not just the brand, either. Where do you want to see the VW conglomerate go next and at what price point?

BYD’s Quality Problems Hit International Markets: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/712148/byd-quality-problems-hit-international-markets/,EVs piling in European warehouses and logistics-related quality issues are new headaches for the world’s largest EV maker.,2024-03-12 16:00:04,"BYD is running into some new obstacles as it expands its footprint in the Chinese and overseas markets. Chinese-made BYD models shipped to Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia are plagued with quality issues, The Wall Street Journal said in its latest report.
The Warren Buffet-backed automaker had a record sales year in 2023, dethroning Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. It was also the third largest automaker by market capitalization as of the end of last year, right behind Tesla and Toyota.
Chinese EVs are electrifying global car markets.
Cheap and well-made Chinese EVs are transforming EV markets in Asia, the Middle East, and South America. BYD is at the forefront of this with models like BYD Seal, Dolphin, and Atto 3 gaining popularity worldwide.
The recent report states that export vehicles from China require several fixes and repairs when they arrive at their destination. Vehicles that landed in Japan had scratches, and the ones that arrived in Europe had mold, the report stated.
While mold can be a common occurrence in cars, especially when they’re stored for a long duration in humid weather, the issue with BYD cars in Europe was that they didn’t receive the proper treatment to have the mold removed.
In Thailand, where Chinese EVs have taken the domestic automotive market by storm, BYD’s quality issues seem to be mounting. Complaints of paint and plastic peeling have become public. Meanwhile, in Israel, BYD EVs are reported to have warped under the weight of roof racks.
These seem like logistics-related issues, rather than manufacturing defects. A BYD executive told WSJ that the issues were equivalent to “going to a decent restaurant but finding that the plate is chipped.” Some 10,000 BYD cars are estimated to be parked in European warehouses, where they have been waiting to be sold since the end of last year.
Maintaining tight quality control across the global shipping route might be a new challenge for BYD. But it’s too early to gauge if these quality problems are false alarms or something BYD needs to take very seriously.
The automaker’s sales slumped in February 2024 due to an industry-wide slowdown. It is also expected to miss its internal target of selling over 400,000 cars in international markets this year.

Drivers Who Are 'Scared Of Change' Are Part Of EV Adoption Problem: Polestar CEO,https://insideevs.com/news/711514/ev-adoption-slowdown-drivers-scared-of-change-polestar-ceo/,"And we thought the lack of EV education, spotty charging infrastructure, and high prices were the main issues.",2024-03-07 09:30:41,"Polestar, the maker of the all-electric Polestar 2 fastback and Polestar 3 crossover, only builds battery-powered cars, which has made some analysts and enthusiasts nickname the company “Europe’s Tesla,” even though the cars are made in China.
Last year, the Geely-owned EV maker delivered roughly 54,500 cars worldwide, which isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s worth noting that the bulk share was represented by the Polestar 2. With more cars in the pipeline, the automaker is hoping to turn its fortunes around starting this year, but some striking remarks from its CEO might make that job a bit harder.
Polestar CEO goes after the undecided
Polestar's CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, said during a recent interview with The Telegraph that drivers who are ""afraid of change"" are to blame for the recent EV adoption rate slowdown. However, data from various surveys shows that people who aren't convinced yet about EVs cite the high prices of battery-powered cars and the lackluster charging infrastructure as the major pain points.
According to Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar’s head honcho, quoted by The Telegraph, people who are scared of change are to blame for the slowdown in the EV adoption growth rate.

“To tell you the truth, I think that [it’s about] being open for innovation and the future technology,” he said when asked why people seemed to lose interest in EVs. “I see far too many people hesitating with that and being scared of change. That is just not a good recipe for the future,” the company’s CEO added.
And while it’s true that people aren’t buying as many EVs as some companies thought they would, putting the blame on the consumer isn’t exactly fair. Especially since industry data has shown time and time again that the main reasons why people aren’t buying more EVs are the high purchase price, spotty charging infrastructure, and range anxiety.
There's also a lack of EV-related education about things like how to precondition an EV battery, what battery types there are out there and what are their advantages and disadvantages, maintenance, and more.
Polestar 2
Polestar 3
Polestar 4
At the same time, however, Polestar’s CEO said that rival carmakers who are slowing down their EV rollout plants–names like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford, among others–are falling into a trap because launching a new product at short notice is very hard to do.
“There’s an incredible threat and danger if you don’t embrace future innovation and believe in that technology–the electric drivetrains, the innovation in battery, the innovation in modern electronics and software,” Ingenlath said for The Telegraph. “If you don’t participate in that and think you can wait, and customers are ready for it, it’s an incredible trap,” he added.
It’s worth noting that Polestar only makes all-electric cars and because of this, its CEO is of the opinion that electric propulsion is a superior technology to combustion engines. “It’s not a question of being electric or being combustion engine: this is a question of who has that convincing, great product. I definitely think that is worth the battle and we will win this.”
Thomas Ingenlath’s remarks came after Polestar secured a $1 billion lending lifeline from banks. This happened after Volvo, which had a controlling hand in Polestar, decided to transfer a portion of its 48% stake to parent company Geely. That said, Polestar has said it needs $1.3 billion in funding to reach its goal of breaking even by 2025, which means it needs an additional $350 million in funding.
The company lost $1 billion in 2021 and another $1.3 billion in 2022, while the first nine months of 2023 saw a loss of $735 million, according to the Swedish-based company’s latest earnings report.",Iulian Dnistran
The GMC Hummer SUV Is The First EV On This 'Meanest' Cars For The Environment List,https://insideevs.com/news/711233/gmc-hummer-ev-meanest-cars-environment-list/,The all-electric SUV’s huge weight makes it a not-so-green choice.,2024-03-05 14:00:18,"The GMC Hummer EV SUV is as much of a four-wheeled statement as the original Hummer H1 was. It’s big, expensive, and packs a lot of off-road tech that will probably never be used.
It’s also quite an electron guzzler, just like its spiritual predecessor was a gas guzzler, requiring about 600-700 watt-hours of energy just to travel one mile, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s mainly due to its massive weight of around 10,000 pounds, 3,000 of which are represented by the battery alone.
The Hummer makes an appearance on the naughy list
Just like its spiritual predecessor, the battery-powered GMC Hummer EV SUV is anything but a green choice. It goes through electrons like it's nobody's business because it weighs roughly 10,000 pounds, making it one of the least efficient EVs in the world. It's also one of the reasons why the ACEEE put it on its annual ""Meanest"" cars for the environment list.
Because of this, the Hummer EV SUV is the first battery-powered car to be featured on the 2024 American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) list of “meanest” vehicles, next to names of gas-burning models like the Ram 1500 TRX, Cadillac Escalade V, Chevrolet Corvette Z06, and Dodge Durango SRT.
More Stories Like This
The ACEEE gave the GMC Hummer EV SUV a so-called Green Score of 29 (the pickup has a score of 30), with an estimated annual fuel cost of $1,746. To put that into perspective, the list of “greenest” cars is spearheaded by the plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius Prime SE with a Green Score of 71 and an estimated annual fuel cost of $529 (if the car is driven 15,000 miles per year).
The Green Score is based on a lifecycle assessment of the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from the production, use, and disposal of each vehicle. the non-profit says it also assesses the upstream emissions generated by the electricity used by an EV, just like it assesses the emissions from fuel burned by an ICE vehicle.
The emissions produced when mining and processing minerals for batteries, as well as from the vehicle manufacturing process are taken into account, too, the ACEEE says.
With all this being said, even though the GMC Hummer EV SUV is on the naughty list, all the cars on the “Greenest” list are either EVs, PHEVs, or hybrids, so going down the battery-powered route is clearly an environmentally friendly way of getting around–if the car doesn’t weigh as much as an apartment building, that is.
According to the full list, the Lexus RZ 300e is the best choice when it comes to EVs, followed by the previous-generation Mini Cooper SE (which will be replaced by a new model) and the Nissan Leaf.
Curiously, though, the highest-rated Tesla, the Model Y, only has a Green Score of 57, even though it consumes less energy per mile than the Mini Cooper SE which has a Green Score of 67. The Model Y AWD consumes 280 Wh/mile, while the Cooper SE needs 310 Wh/mile, according to the EPA. Then again, it’s not just the energy consumption that makes up the score.

Lucid EVs Are Super Efficient Already. They Aim To Get Significantly Better,https://insideevs.com/news/710815/lucid-efficiency-holy-grail/,Company CEO Peter Rawlinson said this milestone is vital for EVs to “save the planet.”,2024-03-02 10:28:14,"Lucid makes what is ostensibly the most efficient luxury electric sedan on the market, the Air. But according to head honcho Peter Rawlinson, EVs need to become even more efficient to “save the planet."" He noted in an interview with the UK's Autocar that “the holy grail” would be an electric car capable of driving 6.2 miles (10 km) on one kilowatt-hour of energy calculated according to the stringent US EPA guidelines for EVs.
That’s about 1.5 times more efficient than the most frugal version of the Lucid Air, the entry-level Air Pure RWD. The Pure RWD's EPA-rated 4.1 miles/kWh puts it considerably ahead of the most efficient version of the Tesla Model S. It's only beaten by the Hyundai Ioniq 6.
EV efficiency is key
Many EV advocates believe that efficiency—the ability to turn energy into motion without waste—is an even more important metric than just driving range. Startup Lucid is a leader in EV efficiency and doesn't believe bigger batteries alone are the key to maximizing range.
It should be noted that Lucid rates the driving efficiency of the Air Pure, with 19-inch wheels, differently (and higher) than the EPA does at 4.76 mi/kWh. A Lucid spokesperson told InsideEVs that their calculation deals more with how much energy from the battery the car will need to travel a certain distance, and not how much energy you'll need if you are fully recharging a nearly dead battery with a home charger. ""Or to put it another way, 4.7 mi/kwh is battery-to-wheel, in contrast with the EPA numbers which measure wall-to-wheel,"" the spokesperson told us.
As a result, Rawlinson told Autocar that the company thinks the Air can be pushed to 5 miles/kWh “pretty soon,” although he didn’t say when or how Lucid was going to achieve this significant efficiency gain.
The Lucid boss held a talk during the Car of the Year event held at this year’s Geneva Motor Show. “People think that we’re on a bandwagon of making expensive, luxury SUVs but we’re here to advance the technology with state-of-the-art EVs,” he said, per Autocar.
This is a reiteration of what he’s said many times in various contexts, promoting a company philosophy that transcends the brand and portrays Lucid as a real force that is working towards the advancement and proliferation of EVs—a bit like Tesla, but with a different flavor.
Unlike most electric vehicle manufacturers (excluding Tesla), which source key parts from third-party suppliers, Lucid has designed most of its components in-house to work with its novel 900-volt EV architecture.
Having such a high voltage has allowed Lucid to reduce the size of many key components, and it also helps with the efficiency of its vehicles. We were hugely impressed when, in 2022, our own Tom Moloughney exceeded 500 miles in a Lucid Air Dream Edition while driving at a constant 70 mph on the highway, probably one of the most significant range tests we’ve ever done.
The Air could average 4.3 miles/kWh in that test because each of its major components was designed to work together with the utmost efficiency in mind, and it remains unbeaten to this day.
Rawlinson didn’t say when, but he noted that “not far in the future, you can get 10km per kWh and then it’s a 300km range from a 30 kWh battery, which is much smaller than today. Then you can reduce the cost of the battery from $20,000 to around $3000-$4000 with proper industrialization and economies of scale.”
Lucid is also working on a more affordable EV to rival Tesla’s smaller offerings, the Model 3 and Model Y. Rawlinson told us in late 2023 that this $50,000 model would debut around the middle of the decade, but he didn’t mention how efficient it would be. We can speculate that being a smaller vehicle benefiting from EV tech that has advanced a few years since the introduction of the Air, this cheaper Lucid will be one of the most efficient EVs on the market.
Granted, Lucid faces an uncertain future, like many EV startups. The company required a substantial cash injection last year from its majority shareholder, the Private Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. But it hopes that the rollout of the Gravity SUV, and ultimately the smaller and more affordable EV, will help it cross the ""valley of death"" and reach the scale it needs to be stable long-term. The company recently expanded its Arizona factory for exactly that effort.
Whether this plan will achieve Rawlinson’s holy grail remains to be seen, but it’s certainly something exciting for EV enthusiasts to look forward to.

Ford reportedly paid $250,000 for the truck. A price that Elon Musk says was ""worth it.""
It seems automakers are eager to acquire and benchmark the Tesla Cybertruck.
Just this week, both Ford and a Porsche dealer acquired a Tesla Cybertruck for around $250,000, presumably for benchmarking and perhaps teardown purposes.
Sawyer Merrit revealed this reported purchase on X, stating:
Ford just paid $250k for a Cybertruck in the aftermarket and is testing it at its proving grounds near Detroit.
The price Ford paid was similar to what a Porsche dealership dished out earlier this week to purchase a Cybertruck at auction. The dealer reportedly paid $244,000 to acquire the Cybertruck. Rumors suggest it was Porsche who actually bought it but had the dealership make the purchase to perhaps hide the automaker's intent.
Musk commented on Porsche acquiring a Cybetruck too, saying that the automaker needs to up its electric vehicle game to match its ""combustion skills"" and noting that ""When they take it apart, they (Porsche) will discover a lot of new technology.""
The ""new"" technologies are mainly the Cybertruck's 48-volt system and steer-by-wire, both of which are not entirely new but not often seen in the industry.
The Tesla Cybertruck's no-resale clause apparently has not prevented the reselling of Cybertrucks. It's suggested that the workaround here is to pay Tesla $50,000 to sell the truck, but the clause seems to imply that you may owe Tesla more than that:
And here's the clause in its entirety:
If you own a Cybertruck, would you be willing to sell it for $250,000? If not, how high would the offer have to go for you to part ways with your Cybertruck?

In a recent interview with Automotive News, Toyota Motor North America’s CEO Ted Ogawa reaffirmed the brand’s ""consumer-dependent"" approach to EVs. Ogawa said that Toyota was planning to increase the share of its pure electric car sales, which were just 0.7% in 2023.
Still, the company believes EVs will only be 30% of the U.S. market by 2030. And that figure is far less than the EV market envisioned in Environmental Protection Agency proposals, not to mention the Biden White House's own goals.
Toyota's ""multipath"" approach to electrification.
Toyota has long held the stance of offering customers the choice of hybrids, BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs. Toyota believes in a cautious approach, but environment experts believe otherwise. They say climate urgency requires aggressive EV adoption. If not, it could be too late for the planet to heal.
""I know that EPA is now reconsidering what the regulation level should be. However, again, our starting point is what the customer demand should be. So, for example, 2030 regulations said the new-car market, more than half of it should be BEV, but our current plan is like 30 percent,"" Ogawa told Automotive News. ""We are respecting the regulation, but more important is customer demand.""
Toyota has long been accused of slow-walking and even lobbying against EV adoption, but in this case, it's not alone.
After vigorous lobbying by automakers, dealer groups, and oil companies, the Biden administration is reportedly considering relaxing the EPA rules. In the initial proposal, the EPA required two-thirds of new light-duty passenger car sales to be electric by 2032. An alternative ruling that the EPA might finalize would still require more than 50% EV penetration—again, far lower than what Toyota is gearing up for.
But Ogawa further endorsed Toyota’s stance. He said 2024 would be the “starting year” of Toyota’s plans to truly broaden its plug-in line-up. As per Ogawa, Toyota is ""catching up"" in not only offering more EVs but also in establishing an ecosystem around charging and energy management. He added that his company would continue pursuing a multi-pronged approach. This includes offering consumers the choice of hybrids, BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs.
At last year's Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed a variety of electric concepts, including a sports car, a Land Cruiser, a compact SUV and a truck—some of which seem likely for production. Toyota is also working heavily on solid-state batteries and plans to build a three-row electric SUV in the U.S. that would compete with the Kia EV9 and the like.
Ogawa added that Toyota would respect the upcoming regulations, but more importantly, it would keep an eye on what the customers want. A blanket EV adoption would equal a “wasted investment,” worse than purchasing carbon credits, which is one way entities can offset their carbon emissions, by indirectly funding projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.
The 86-year-old Japanese automaker has manufactured gas-powered and hybrid cars for most of its existence. It pioneered lean manufacturing in the 1980s, which involved streamlining supply-chain, minimizing production errors, maximizing worker efficiency at the assembly line, and reducing costs—something all its major rivals, including American carmakers, ended up adopting.
The upcoming elections and the EPA's final ruling would undoubtedly impact the whole industry. But whether Toyota’s ""multipath"" approach to electrification matches consumer demand or leaves the automaker behind remains to be seen.

A Reminder That China's Electric Car Companies Are Not Invincible,https://insideevs.com/news/710518/hiphi-shutdown-cash-production-pause/,China's HiPhi is shutting down of its factory for six months while it searches for a way to financial solvency. Is this the end for the futuristic EV startup?,2024-02-29 14:30:22,"As BYD and Geely both jock for EV world domination, it can be easy to assume that all Chinese EV manufacturers are similarly destined for greatness. Actually, the truth is a bit more mixed. Big players like those two are doing well, but China's many, many smaller brands are facing some of the same profitability issues and lackluster sales that face any other EV startup elsewhere in the world.
Take Human Horizons, commonly known as HiPhi Auto, for example. It's not doing so hot. As of right now, the company is shut down for at least six months, and rumors are swirling if it’ll be purchased and resume production.
Not every Chinese EV manufacturer is doing well
BYD and Geely are selling strongly, but not every EV manufacturer is doing well. HiPhi, Chinese a high-end EV manufacturer that also sells in Europe, announced it is stopping production for six months as it has run out of capital to continue on. Chinese automakers are suffering from the same issues with profitability that affect other brands outside of that country.
For those not in the know, HiPhi is a high-end Chinese EV maker. Currently, it produces the HiPhi Z and HiPhi X, two crossover-esque vehicles that wouldn’t look out of place as a car in Cyberpunk 2077. HiPhi has even started to venture outside of China, selling its high-end EV in parts of European markets. It has also started to venture downmarket with the HiPhi Y, a $48,000 EV crossover aimed slightly above the Tesla Model Y.
The HiPhi Y went on sale in China in mid-July 2023, with plans to eventually sell the cheaper car in Europe alongside its higher-priced models.
Unfortunately, it’s not clear if that’ll ever happen. Initially, there were rumblings on Chinese social media about unpaid salaries and canceled year-end employee bonuses in January. But on Feb. 18, the company announced that it was reducing everyone’s salaries to the minimum required by Beijing law, shutting down its factory, and suspending production for six months.
Certainly, this isn’t a great look for HiPhi. But it would be one of the latest startup Chinese EV brands to close up shop.
Byton, a company that promised to bring US drivers a sleek EV SUV, did a six-month furlough in April 2020 only to officially die in 2021. Levdeo, which made the Letin Mengo, failed in May. Weltmeister (aka WM Motor), a brand that was one of the first to the EV crossover craze and even outsold the Tesla Model Y for a split second in time, has yet to rise from the post-bankruptcy restructuring phase that it entered in October.
With that in mind, HiPhi’s break doesn’t necessarily mean the brand is completely doomed, though. Somehow, the brand Hengchi, the EV arm of infamous (and now infamously troubled) Chinese real estate company Evergrande, managed to get its EV crossover back in production after a months-long shutdown. The tooling for Niutron, the EV brand made by electric scooter maker Niu, was ported to one of its manufacturers and renamed to the Docan V07, although it’s not entirely clear if the car has ever gone officially on sale.
Of course, we can’t forget Faraday Future, a brand that has gone through several similar furloughs and layoffs, yet somehow continues to cheat death.
All of this comes at a time when China's once-unstoppable economy is slowing down, or at least normalizing after a period of massive growth. Sales of homes and cars—two important measurements for the health of any economy—have been slowing for a while, for various reasons. It looks to be entering a nasty real estate crisis. And a lot of the government subsidies that drove EV adoption are winding down there, too.
None of this is to say that Western and other Asian markets can underestimate China. They already have, and look where that got them. But it helps to remember this country and its car business have significant headwinds of their own.
As for HiPhi, it's trying to figure out a way to make itself profitable, or at the very least figure out a way to inject its pocketbook with cash. According to reporting from CarNewsChina, the brand is seeking a suitor, as well as looking for a way to reduce some of its financial burdens. Some have speculated the prospects of several companies, anyone from Huawei to Changan.
There has been no official news from HiPhi if there is a deal on the table, but Reportedly, HiPhi CEO Ding Lei has confirmed that he has met with Changan at its HQ in Chongquing.
It would no doubt be kind of sad if this was the end of HiPhi. Editor-in-Chief Patrick George saw a Z in person in Europe last year, and he said “It looks like a cross between a Nissan GT-R and a Gundam, and I mean that as the highest possible compliment.” The HiPhi Z has more than 600 horsepower and could scoot to 60 MPH in less than four seconds, so it certainly had the performance chops to play with the big boys. It even outperformed EV models from established brands in a recent cold weather test.
But as we're seeing with China, great tech alone isn't enough to make you a winner in a very, very crowded market. Couple that with high interest rates globally and markets that are increasingly wary of exports from China, plus China's own economic troubles, and their road to dominance is far from straightforward.
It may even buy some time for the rest of the world to catch up—that is, if they're down to try.

Ford's NACS Fast Charging Adapter Now Available As Tesla Charging Network Opens,https://insideevs.com/news/710517/tesla-supercharger-adapters-online-february/,"Ford EV owners can order their complimentary Tesla NACS to CCS adapters starting today, just as Supercharger access opens up to them.",2024-02-29 09:00:00,"Everybody knows that the public fast-charging life is just easier when you're a Tesla owner. But starting today, Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E owners will begin to play on their level too as the Tesla Supercharger network opens up to them.
Ford today announced two major developments on the electric front. First, Ford customers can now order the Fast Charging Adapter—the first from a major automaker—that allows Tesla North American Charging Standard (NACS) plugs to link up to the Combined Charging System (CCS) fast-charging port standard on basically all non-Tesla EVs.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
For years, Tesla's proprietary charging network was considered the best—but it was open only to Teslas. Now the rest of the car industry is switching to Tesla's smaller and sleeker plug, and finding ways to grant access to Tesla's stellar charging network. In other words, the charging experience enjoyed by Tesla owners will soon be more open to all kinds of EVs.
Second, both Ford's EVs and the Tesla Supercharger network are receiving over-the-air updates that will enable Ford vehicles to charge at those stations, just like any Tesla can. That adds another 15,000 DC fast chargers for Ford owners as soon as they get their adapters in the mail.
In other words, today marks the beginning of the era where Tesla's Superchargers, which are widely regarded as the most extensive and most reliable public charging network in North America, start to open up to drivers of all kinds of EVs. Soon, other automakers will follow Ford's lead in allowing Tesla charging access via an adapter, and in the years to come nearly all of them will use Tesla's NACS plug format from the factory.
More than 80% of Ford EV owners charge at home, said Ken Williams, Ford's Director of Charging and Energy Services. ""Their main pain point is public charging,"" he said.
Today, that starts to get a lot less painful.
Robert Hayes, Ford's Manager of Public Charging Customer Experience, said that owners can now log into their FordPass account, go to the Connected Service Home Page, click the offer for the free charger, and then receive it in the mail free of charge. They can also do so on Ford's website.
The charger is free until June 30. Starting July 1, it's going to cost $230, which includes taxes and shipping. The adapters are expected to start shipping over the coming weeks.
Ford officials said that the adapter does not have any communication protocols, so in theory, it should work with any EV. But since those EVs may not yet be authenticated to work with Tesla's network, don't expect them to actually charge. Officials added that the adapter is not expected to impact charging speeds or performance. (Neither Ford nor Tesla recommend the use of any third-party adapters, which are increasingly hitting the market but may present safety concerns.)
Thanks to the over-the-air updates, Ford EV owners with the adapter will be able to plug in and charge automatically, without using a credit card onsite; the same convenience Tesla owners enjoy. ""Once owners have created an account and activated Plug & Charge, Tesla Superchargers will support Plug & Charge with Ford EVs,"" Ford officials said. ""This means customers simply have to plug in and charging will automatically start with charges managed through FordPass.""
The native Tesla app is also not needed for the experience. The FordPass app is recommended instead to find compatible chargers and determine charging prices, Hayes said. The Tesla Supercharger system is now the 11th on Ford's Blue Oval Network, which lets Ford owners charge and pay natively without using multiple apps, memberships or on-site payment methods.
Owners of the Ford E-Transit van may have to wait a bit longer because that vehicle will have to be updated at dealerships later to use the plug-and-charge feature.
The other upside to this move is that later this spring, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will offer native route planning to Tesla Supercharger stations from their navigation apps. Ford has been ramping up those features within the popular smartphone projection systems for a while, allowing their navigation systems to tell drivers how much range they'll have at their destination or where to divert and charge if that's necessary; now Tesla's Superchargers will get in on the fun. (And remember, charging route planning is one big reason crosstown rival General Motors cited for dumping Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on its EVs, so this move says a lot.)
Ford stressed that Tesla sets the prices for charging, so it's not immediately clear whether Ford owners will have to pay more for electricity. (Normally, this is where we'd ask Tesla for comment, but the automaker no longer speaks with the press in North America.) Ford officials speculated that charging prices could be similar to what Magic Dock users enjoy, but this is unconfirmed for now.
Ford also added that all of the older V2 Superchargers, which were limited to 150kW charging speeds, are not compatible with this process. But since the faster V3 Superchargers have been around since 2019 and the improved V4 Superchargers began rolling out last year, it may not be too much of an inconvenience.
Finally, Ford confirmed that the adapters are for DC fast-charging only; they do not work with Tesla's NACS-equipped slower destination chargers, which run on AC power.
InsideEVs will know exactly how the Ford Fast Charging Adapter performs in real-world situations when we do a charging test with one in the coming days; stay tuned for that.
Besides delivering a crushing blow to range anxiety for Ford EV owners, these announcements ostensibly begin the era when Tesla's plug—now called the SAE J3400 standard—starts to take over charging in North America. The slimmer, sleeker plug has many advantages over the heavy and unwieldy CCS fast-charging plug, and grants access to Tesla's vast network in the process.
It was Ford that kicked this process off last May by announcing the forthcoming adapters, followed by a move to native NACS plugs from 2025 onward. Over the following months, nearly every other automaker announced it would follow Ford's lead here as they were reportedly fed up with the subpar experiences offered by other charging networks.
So far, charging access—specifically, public fast charging—has proved to be a major barrier to wider EV adoption. While most owners charge at home, they do need fast charging for road trips or when they don't have their own garage. Automakers expected charging networks to just kind of pop up on their own as gas stations did; clearly, that ended up not being the case. Many of them are now finding ways to build their own networks instead.
Opening up Tesla's charging network should help fix some of those challenges, given how ubiquitous, reliable and seamless the experience is. (It also stands to provide Tesla with a massive new revenue source, potentially up to $20 billion by 2030.)
The move won't be some magic bullet for Ford EV owners, however. For one, it's going to take time to see if the cars and the chargers have any software compatibility issues. Lines at Tesla Supercharger stations are probably due to get longer as more EVs can juice up there, although new ones are being added all of the time.
But with any luck, this marks a new era for the standardization and maturity of the North American EV charging experience. That will be even more apparent once the cars use the Tesla plug format from the factory as well. For now, Ford's EV owners can count on fewer headaches when they're on the road.

"American Test Of $11,500 BYD Seagull: 'This Doesn't Come Across Cheap'",https://insideevs.com/news/710364/byd-detroit-import-seagull-caresoft/,"The imported EV hatchback may only cost $11,500 but it impressed industry veteran John McElroy.",2024-02-27 19:21:55,"China has put everyone on notice, but you probably already knew that by now. European, Japanese, and American automakers have struggled to sell their EV shapes at a reasonable price, without sacrificing any semblance of profitability. Meanwhile, cheap and cheerful Chinese-branded EVs have only continued to proliferate across the globe, reaching price parity with ICE cars without destroying profit.
Seeking to figure out how the heck Chinese OEMs do it, Detroit-area Automotive benchmarking company Caresoft imported an $11,500 BYD Seagull for analysis. With it, automotive journalist veteran John McElroy and Terry Woychowski, the president of Caresoft, are left significantly impressed.
“This doesn't come across as cheap,” Woychowski said.
The BYD Seagull Is An Immense Success
The BYD Seagull has been an incredible success for the Chinese brand. Officially launched in China in April 2023, the brand had produced a stunning 200,000 units by the start of December of the same year. With a base price of roughly $10,000 and a range of up to 250 miles (on the CLTC standard), it's little wonder why the small cheap car has been so popular.
The video begins with the two analyzing the exterior of the vehicle, as Woychowski calls out some of the probable cost-saving measures BYD took to manufacture the Seagull. For example, the Seagull only has one mono wiper for the entire vehicle, and it is on the front. There is no rear wiper, which means that BYD only has to manufacture one wiper arm, one wiper motor, and one wiper blade, driving down costs.
Similarly, the two presenters remarked on BYD’s knack for vertical integration. Not much, if anything, on the Seagull is outsourced to a third-party supplier. Body panels, light clusters, motors, batteries, power electronics, and more are all made in-house, by BYD itself.
But some of the real masterful manufacturing that Woychowski gushes over is how some of the vehicle's spot welds, particularly at the rear trunk portal area, are exceptionally neat. According to Woychowski, it doesn’t like BYD’s factories had issues trying to get the panels in place. Also, because the welds are good-looking, they won’t need to be hidden with trim, saving costs.
The video is McElroy and Woychowski impressed by the Seagull’s perceived quality and immense value. Coming in under $12 grand, the Seagull offers a lot of utility and equipment for not much price. This test vehicle came with a (synthetic) leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, a power driver’s seat, and a surprisingly high amount of soft-touch surfaces. McElroy was impressed with the driving experience. With a mere 75 horsepower or so, it’s not lightning-fast, but it is adequate.
This imported Seagull wasn’t made to pass U.S. crash standards, but Woychowski did mention that BYD as a whole is altering its model lineup to sell in Europe and beyond. BYD has already made significant alterations to the Dolphin, adding a bigger nose for improved crash performance.
This just once again shows how far China and BYD have come in the global automotive race. I can second McElroy’s opinions, although I haven’t driven a BYD Seagull, I was able to get behind the wheel of a BYD Atto 3 while in Paris a short while ago. I was similarly gobsmacked with how good the vehicle was. The driving experience was pleasant, and the car’s construction felt remarkably neat.
Like McElroy, I understood why so many consumers are buying BYDs and the like. Chinese cars have reached the point where they’re purchased on merit, and not necessarily because they’re cheap. Those facts mean that Chinese EVs inherently are an existential threat to every other automaker.
Caresoft’s BYD Seagull will be taken apart, studied, and benchmark-tested. Soon, we’ll have a better understanding of how BYD was able to make this car so cheap, and if it’s even possible for other automakers.

"The Apple Car Is Finally Dead, Shrouded In Mystery Until The End: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/710352/apple-car-dead-project-titan/,"After a decade and a reported $1 billion spent annually, Apple's infamous ""Project Titan"" couldn't survive the tech layoff apocalypse.",2024-02-27 15:05:40,"For years, it was believed to be the biggest game-changer the automotive sector had ever seen—beyond any Tesla or any other startup's effort. But after a decade that was marked with uncertainty, reported infighting over its purpose and a rumored $1 billion spent annually on development, the Apple Car effort is said to be finally dead, Bloomberg reported today.
Instead, some of the Apple employees involved with the car effort—known as Project Titan—will be shuffled over to something considerably hotter at the moment: generative AI projects, according to Bloomberg.
The Apple Car Project was a mystery until the end
Many critics said Apple had no business developing a car. That included auto industry executives, even as Apple poached many of them. Today, the car's exact design and purpose remains a mystery, although both are said to have changed many times over the past decade.
The news wire reports the move came as ""a surprise"" to more than 2,000 employees working on it, not all of whom might keep their jobs. And that decision by Apple also arrives at a time when the entire tech sector is exacting brutal layoffs; for months, thousands of employees at Meta, Google and other companies have lost their jobs amid high interest rates and wider belt-tightening.
Just a few weeks ago, the car was said to be in a ""make or break moment"" as executives weighed what to do with it, and the employees behind it. Most recently, Project Titan was said to be an electric vehicle with a price tag around $100,000 and some automated driving assistance functions, but not full autonomy.
In other words, Apple went ""break"" with Project Titan, not ""make.""
From 2024's vantage point, it's hard to fathom just how big a deal the Apple Car was a decade earlier.
In the years after the death of Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs, the tech titan sought to make a name for itself by breaking into the automotive world with a software-driven and presumably electric effort long before those concepts were in the mainstream. By virtue of Apple being Apple, the car was regarded by many as a potentially massive game-changer—something that could reset the order of things just like the iPhone did for personal communications and connectivity.
After all, why not? On top of Apple's own tech might, the company poached top talent from across the car industry and its related fields, including veterans of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Ford, Samsung and others. At one point, this helped fuel rumors that Apple might buy Tesla outright. (To give one example of what a big deal this one, Motor Trend ""designed"" one and put it on a magazine cover in 2016.)
But problems arose almost from the start. While it made sense for the company behind Apple CarPlay to want to get more involved in the software-driven car revolution, there was considerable debate from within as to whether Project Titan would yield a passenger car for consumers, a robotaxi and accompanying service, or some combination of the two. At one point, developers even acquired an old Fiat Jolly, for reasons that remain unknown.
Yet years of development hell resulted in setbacks, delays, secrecy, fights with other automakers, high-profile departures, layoffs, failed partnership attempts, and still no clear idea of what an Apple Car would even be or do. By the early 2020s, the project was still said to be trudging along, albeit with few new developments.
Things seemed to be changing fairly recently, however. The Washington Post reported some Apple autonomous driving tests in California just a few weeks ago, leading many to wonder what Apple had up its sleeve in the transportation department. (And for all we know, whatever that testing was much lead to something else car-related.) But today, the dream seems dead for real—shunted into the past so Apple can focus on the hottest new thing in tech, which is AI.
In the end, did the world need a whole car from Apple? It seems like a safer play would always be to stay in its software lane, perfecting something automakers consistently struggle with. That certainly seems to be the plan for the more all-encompassing future versions of CarPlay.
But it's hard to know what we all were missing out on here because we never knew much about it to begin with. Over more than 10 years, it lived and then died as ""a car, but from Apple,"" and the rest is probably only known to those who are NDA'd to hell and back. It remains the greatest mystery in cars—and tech, too—that no one has ever really figured out yet.

Hyundai Confirms Its Georgia 'Metaplant' EV Factory Is Opening Early,https://insideevs.com/news/710346/hyundai-metaplant-schedule-2024/,"As other automakers fret over demand, Hyundai Motor Group is ahead of schedule on its EV factory.",2024-02-27 13:30:27,"If you think every automaker is in retreat mode on electric vehicles after a couple of slower months, think again. Korea's Hyundai Motor Group, which proved last year that it's a force to be reckoned with in the EV world, has no intention of slowing down this year. The Kia EV9 is already on sale and receiving rave reviews, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 can be had with outstanding deals, and the Ioniq 7 three-row crossover will be revealed this summer.
And in an even better bit of news, Hyundai yesterday confirmed that its Georgia ""Metaplant""—a super factory devoted to EVs, batteries and powertrain components for them—will actually open later this year, ahead of schedule.
Huge EV investments are being made in America
Spurred by the tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, and eager to offer tax breaks on cars made in North America, the EV revolution is bringing scores of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.
The Metaplant near Savannah is slated to open in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a ""grand opening"" ceremony in the first quarter of 2025, company officials said yesterday. Previously, the plant was slated to open in 2025. This announcement, which the automaker alluded to last year, came at the ""Hyundai Day"" celebration at Georgia's state capitol.
There, company officials were flanked by Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia's First Lady, along with a row of EVs and the hydrogen-powered XCIENT Fuel Cell Truck.
Georgia has reason to be happy with the Korean automaker. The Metaplant is a $7.59 billion investment (on top of the $5 billion EV battery cell plant in Bartow County, Georgia built with SK On) that's said to create 8,500 new jobs. The state is said to have provided $1.8 billion in incentives, including tax breaks, to create what will be one of the Hyundai Motor Group's biggest EV manufacturing ecosystems for decades to come.
A Hyundai USA spokesperson told InsideEVs that the plant will build Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models, but it has not announced which ones yet. It feels like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would be a reasonable bet, alongside the Genesis GV60; all of those E-GMP platform EVs are excellent but none are made in North America, so they do not qualify for any U.S. tax credits unless they are leased. (Kia Georgia’s West Point assembly plant is due to make the EV9 later this year, positioning it to get at least some tax credits eventually.)
Hyundai, Genesis and Kia all have huge, global plans for EVs. In Kia's case, that also means EV production across eight global bases by 2025, including Georgia. And if they make some already good models even cheaper for Americans to buy, going hard and fast with those plant investments should pay off nicely.

Electrification Leads To All-Wheel-Drive Dominance,https://insideevs.com/news/710128/electrification-leads-awd-dominance/,75% of EV configurations are all-wheel drive.,2024-02-26 16:00:08,"When analyzing the all-electric vehicle (EV) market, we have noticed that the segment shifted towards all-wheel-drive (AWD) powertrains. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) and rear-wheel-drive (RWD) models are in the minority.
It wasn't always like that though. Between 2010 and 2013, there were only single-motor FWD and RWD models on the market. Things changed in the 2014 model year when Tesla introduced a dual-motor AWD version of the Model S (85D).
In the 2015 model year, Tesla expanded the dual-motor family to a few versions (about a quarter of all versions on the market, at the time), and then doubled the AWD lineup with the newly launched Model X in the 2016 model year.
We had to wait until the 2018 model year to see the AWD Tesla Model 3, and until the 2019 model year to see the first non-Tesla, dual-motor, AWD model: the Audi e-tron SUV and Jaguar I-Pace. At the time, the share of AWD accounted for about half of all EV configurations.
The AWD domination progressed, initially through premium/high-performance models. However, later, the mainstream models started to get all-wheel drive versions too.
In the 2023 model year, we saw the first tri-motor, all-wheel drive EVs—the Audi e-tron S, which was equipped with one electric motor in the front, and two separate electric motors in the rear. Meanwhile, Rivian introduced its quad-motor, all-wheel drive powertrain in R1T and R1S models (one motor per wheel).
Having a dual-motor AWD system helps with traction and performance, and has some benefits related to regenerative braking. The tri-motor or quad-motor versions can improve performance further through torque vectoring of particular wheels.
There are drawbacks as well, in the form of complexity, cost and weight. Efficiency is also slightly compromised, thus single-motor models are at the top of the energy consumption ranking. It might also be difficult to fit two independent motors in the front because it's the steering axle.
The dual-motor system is the simplest and most cost-effective ""good-enough"" way to achieve all-wheel drive. We also believe that it's ""easier"" or more ""native"" if you wish, to develop an AWD EV with two electric motors than an internal combustion engine vehicle with AWD.
There are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels. According to our data, roughly three-quarters (some 250), or 75% of them are all-wheel drive.
In the case of front-wheel drive configurations, there are only about 30 of them (less than 9%). Rear-wheel drive configurations account for nearly a 17% share (56 configurations).
These numbers do not automatically mean that sales of AWD vehicles represent 75%—this is the number of configurations—but it seems that electrification transforms the car market towards AWD.
We will see whether this trend will continue, because obviously, the single-motor cars should be less expensive and many companies are now working on more affordable models. There might be a new wave of FWD/RWD models and their sales might be higher than AWD several years from now.

Right now, the biggest thing keeping you from being able to buy a super cheap but surprisingly high-tech Chinese EV like a $10,000 BYD Seagull is the fact that the U.S. has 27.5% import tariffs on cars made there. (Some vehicles are sold here with the tariff in place, like the Polestar 2 and the upcoming Volvo EX30, but examples are few and far between.) But nothing is stopping automakers like BYD from getting around that tariff by making cars in Mexico; in fact, they'd even theoretically qualify for tax breaks up to $7,500 per car because they're made in North America.
The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade group that represents several manufacturing sectors here, calls this an ""existential threat"" to the U.S. economy. In a new report issued Friday and first covered by Reuters, they are calling on some significant policy changes to cut China off before it can make inroads into the U.S. via our neighbor (and top trading partner) to the south. From their report:
We have already seen in steel and aluminum industries what happens when unfairly traded imports are allowed to swamp the U.S. market: Job losses, bankruptcies and deindustrialization. It has taken some de-industrialized communities decades to revitalize. Others continue to struggle. The domestic auto industry, with its millions of American workers and intricate ties to hundreds of other industries, is integral to American manufacturing. It is simply too important to the country’s economic security to be exposed to such blatantly unfair competition.
The commercial backdoor left open to Chinese auto imports should be shut before it causes mass plant closures and job losses in the United States. Washington should undertake the following policy recommendations to preempt their entry.
They recommend a number of things, including exclusionary tariffs on all Chinese automobile imports into the U.S. regardless of origin; enforcing tougher rules under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor to NAFTA; excluding ""companiesheadquartered in a non-market economy"" from the USMCA terms; and keeping Chinese companies from accessing taxpayer-funded research in the U.S.
How serious a threat is all of this? Today, Business Insider has a big feature diving into the whole thing, and it puts it into very stark terms, emphasis mine below:
""The thought that Chinese-quality engineering and design are not as high quality as the legacy carmakers — that should be put to bed,"" Tu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy focusing on the Chinese EV market, told me. ""Right now, the legacies don't have competitive products. There's a vacuum. If China EV Inc. were allowed to enter the US today or next year, the legacies would be gutted.""
We are witnessing a shock to the global automotive order unseen since Japan barreled into the market in the 1970s. China's EV ascendance has sparked a fight that is forcing companies to stretch the limits of their technological capability and policymakers to reimagine the ideological underpinnings of decades of trade strategy. What's at stake is nothing less than a US industry worth $104 billion, about as much as Angola's national GDP, and all the 3 million jobs that come with it.
""It's a global game. It has been a global game,"" Le said. ""Motherfuckers just haven't been paying attention.""
America has certainly fired back with import tariffs and restrictions on foreign competition before, but this is on a different level—and aimed very specifically at China. Granted, doing so could spark a trade war with China if that country decides to turn the screws in a different way in retaliation. But everyone from Elon Musk to executives at Ford and Stellantis are calling China a grave and unprecedented threat to the U.S. auto industry, so it may be a risk politicians are willing to take.
One huge problem with the EV market in America is that the things are still widely regarded as too expensive for a permanent wave of mass adoption—yes, even with the tax incentives and copious dealer discounts. There are a lot of reasons for this. Rising interest rates and inflation are one. But another is that the U.S. auto industry (and you can include the ""import"" brands in this too) have become addicted to high-price, high-margin trucks and SUVs financed over eight, nine or 10 years. It can't compete on cheap cars anymore because it barely offers them.
This has especially hit the Jeep brand in recent years; it tried to go ""upmarket"" on its SUVs and customers didn't really respond. Jeep's sales were even down 6% last year in the U.S., which is not good.
So as Jeep seeks to deploy EVs for the first time—the Jeep Wagoneer S and Jeep Recon—it needs to reevaluate pricing across the board, Antonio Filsosa, the brand’s new CEO, said on Friday. Here's The Detroit News:
""We need to do something on market penetration and market share, because it's not where this brand deserves to be,"" Filosa said during a roundtable with reporters at the automaker's North American headquarters. ""The perception of the brand is fantastic, and we have survey data that never has been so strong.""
Lineup adjustments affect about 90% of its sales. Jeep has added more than $3,000 in content to the flagship Jeep Wrangler off-roader as well as the refreshed ’24 Gladiator midsize pickup, whose manufacturer’s suggested retail price is $1,700 lower this week starting at $38,990. The Jeep Compass crossover, now the brand’s entry-level model in the United States after discontinuing the Renegade in the market, starts at $25,900 with a $2,500 lower MSRP. The Grand Cherokee, Jeep’s best-selling offering, is as much as $4,000 lower starting at $36,495.
[...] EVs also could be an opportunity to grow market share if Jeep's 4xe plug-in hybrid success is any indication. The Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xes are the best-selling PHEVs in the United States, securing more than half of PHEV sales. Ninety percent of those customers, Filosa said, are conquests.
""We need those models to be along with our consumers,"" he said of the EVs. ""It's a consumer-based strategy, not regulation-based.""
This reminds me of when Ford looked at slowing F-150 Lightning sales last year and declared that the rules have changed. It's not enough for these automakers to keep doing the same things they've always done in the electric transition, at the same prices, and just expect customers to show up—certainly not until charging gets better across the board, anyway.
Several of the EV startups—Rivian, Lucid and Fisker—have slightly different versions of the same problem in 2024. They launched with their most expensive models to gin up cash, and next, they want to use that cash and investor capital to scale up for more mass-production models—and hope that customers show up. The space between those things is often called the ""EV valley of death.""
Electric truck maker Rivian is in that spot too. I think it's doing better, and has more potential, than other startups in the field, but this year is going to be tough until it can start selling the smaller and more affordable R2 in volume. Here are our friends at climate site Heatmap News to explain:
Claire McDonough, Rivian’s chief financial officer and a former J.P. Morgan director, has a plan for crossing that canyon — an aptly if strangely named “bridge to profitability” that it will attempt to build this year. Rivian’s survival, she said, will depend above all on cutting the unit costs of producing its vehicles, including by using fewer materials to make every car. Other savings will come from making more vehicles faster. That’s what makes the shutdown plan, though it might seem extreme, worth it; McDonough said those improvements alone will get the company about 80% of the way to profitability.
Another 15% will come from marketing more “software-enabled products” to Rivian drivers and by selling air-pollution credits to other carmakers, whose vehicles are not as climate-friendly. This is a tried-and-true technique; Tesla first turned a profit in 2021 by selling regulatory credits needed to comply with federal and California state-level rules to other, dirtier automakers. But that same year, Tesla also debuted an entirely new vehicle: the Model Y crossover, which quickly became its top seller in the United States. Tesla, in other words, finally started to make money by cutting costs, finding new revenue sources, and releasing new products.
New products, however, are becoming a weak point for Rivian. The company says that high interest rates will keep demand for its vehicles flat this year. It expects to make about 60,000 of them, about 20,000 fewer than what it had once anticipated. The Rivian R1S, a three-row S.U.V., has become the company’s flagship; it is selling better and is cheaper to manufacture than Rivian’s pickup, the R1T. It also costs at least $75,000, or nearly $600 a month to lease. The highest-tier models can cost $99,000. Turns out, it’s difficult to sell a lot of $70,000 trucks when even the cheapest new-car loans hover around 6%.
Rivian announced layoffs last week, citing high interest rates that led to projections of flat sales for most of 2024. Does it have what it takes to make it?
On one hand, we have dealer groups and industry lobbyists begging the White House to ""slow down"" on emissions rules that will lead to wider EV adoption, and that could push back more EV models and further R&D. On the other hand, they realize they're pretty outclassed by China at the moment and asking to keep those cars out of the U.S. market.
Can the business have it both ways here? How far does protectionism go to actually protect before it makes you technologically behind?

Expert To Dealers: Embrace EVs Or Lose Your Jobs,https://insideevs.com/news/709026/how-dealers-can-embrace-evs/,"Analysts agree that rolling back EV policies would be unacceptable, and dealers need to do more to embrace EVs.",2024-02-23 15:00:26,"Despite the threats posed by climate change, the U.S. remains deeply divided on electric cars. A J.D. Power report from 2023 suggested that even in the long term, electric cars will constitute only a small percentage of new vehicle sales in dozens of U.S. states. Whereas in states like California, Colorado, and New York, EVs are on track to comprise the majority of new sales by 2035. One of the biggest drivers of this division is car dealers.
Of the roughly 17,000 car dealers in the U.S., about 30% have formally urged President Biden to “hit the brakes” on EVs. His administration announced last week that he intends to slow down the EPA regulations. One of their pressure tactics is writing letters to the president—two have been written so far and signed by thousands of dealers—demanding a pushback against the EPA’s proposed rules that mandate two-thirds of new light-duty vehicle sales to be electric by 2032.
While some concerns surrounding range anxiety and inadequate and unreliable charging infrastructure are true, the argument against hitting the brakes on EVs contradicts the urgency posed by climate change.
America's EV transition has a dealer problem.
Nearly one-third of U.S. car dealers are urging President Biden to stop the EPA from implementing its strict upcoming emissions standards. However, experts think dealers could play a bigger role in the climate movement by systemically embracing EVs.
After President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act in 2021 and 2022, the groundwork was laid for the U.S. to move toward EVs, with hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to establish a local supply chain and ecosystem. However, experts say that successful EV adoption requires more than just policy support. They stress the need to reinvent how dealers sell cars and the pivotal role they can play in promoting them, which could lead to fewer political, socio-economic, and cultural divisions around EVs and accelerate decarbonization.
Tu Le, the managing director of market research and management consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, told InsideEVs that leveraging EV technology was a great tool at the dealers' disposal to drive EV sales. “[U.S.] car dealers should shift their attention towards being brand stewards and using the technology to get more folks in the showroom,” Le said. He added that sales reps need to think of EVs as less of a threat to their jobs, and more of how they could contribute to the larger goal of reducing emissions.
Certain temporary roadblocks can indeed be dealbreakers for consumers. The fear of getting stranded with a dead battery in the middle of nowhere, software hiccups, or out-of-order charging dispensers can be major headaches. But the industry is trying to solve these issues. Leveraging the technology now could help consumers adopt it in the long run. Let's face it, the advantages of EVs are remarkable: lower operating costs and carbon footprint, better energy efficiency, explosive off-the-line performance, etc. If dealers believe in the tech, their customers will follow suit.
""Dealer groups and sales reps look at the OEMs wanting to use the technology to replace them and that's certainly true in some cases but it's time to re-negotiate the dealer-OEM relationship.” He continued, “[dealers should] reinforce the brand promise, and product positioning and continue to build that trust and excitement [in what they are selling].” In reality, it seems like dealer groups are building anything but trust. And that fear-mongering could trickle down to customers.
The National Association of Dealers has vowed “to get the president to bend this policy in a more realistic direction.” It's something the Biden administration seems on track to do this election year to garner more voter support. The Alliance For Automotive Innovation (AAI), representing 42 car brands including General Motors and Ford along with dozens of suppliers, has said that the EPA’s goals are “neither reasonable nor achievable in the timeframe provided.”
Consequently, the EPA has tremendous pressure to revise its proposed guidelines. An EPA spokesperson told InsideEVs, “The draft final rulemaking titled ‘The Multi Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles’ is currently in the interagency review process. EPA has received more than 250,000 public comments for the proposed rulemaking and the Agency will address those comments as part of the final rule.”
The EPA refused to comment on the final ruling, but the Biden administration has signaled that it intends to relax the rules until 2030 and make them stricter from there on, the New York Times reported.
Environment groups think any rolling back of policy would exacerbate public health problems caused due to vehicle emissions. Katherine Garcia, the director of the Clean Transportation For All campaign at the non-profit Sierra Club, told me, “Slowing down the policies would be unacceptable. Voting down the policies would be a disservice to Americans. We need to act on climate now. We need to make sure that we are protecting public health.”
Sierra Club and dozens of other environment and clean transportation groups under the umbrella of what's called the Auto Accountability Coalition have written a sign-on letter to the AAI to forego ""obstructive anti-climate lobbying efforts"" and support the EPA's proposed mandates.
However, unlike the dealers, AAI adds greater nuance to its argument. Regardless of the alliance's position, its members are forging ahead with new mass-market EVs and domestic battery manufacturing plants. Currently, the rules propose that 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales be electric by 2032. The AAI recommends that the figure be 40% to 50% by 2030, including BEVs, PHEVs, and FCEVs. It also recommends the EPA align President Biden's goals with California's LEV IV standards for “criteria pollutants.”
The California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) LEV IV standards focus on removing specific hazardous pollutants from the air as opposed to imposing a blanket EV mandate. The standards include reducing nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gases, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide emissions in a phased manner. The regulations set limits on the amount of these pollutants that vehicles can emit, with progressively tightening rules over time.
Regardless of where the EPA lands with its final ruling, the dealers are inextricably intertwined in this puzzle. If American dealers have to replicate even a small percentage of China or Norway’s success, they’d have to work with manufacturers and policymakers to embrace EVs. “It takes a combination of dealers and a strong online presence to attract customers to the [legacy] OEMs' products. The ones who can crack that code will be much better off,” Le said.
He suggested that there are currently ""too many"" dealerships in the U.S. and that it's the correct time to ""right size."" However, he warned that refusing to embrace EVs would be detrimental to their survival. “[the dealers] aren't a very innovative bunch, but that's because they haven't had to be and from their pleas to Biden, they are kicking and screaming about having to sell a 'new' product that they say people don't want.”
More EV News
Le's last point regarding consumers not wanting EVs has caused a quagmire in the industry. 2023 was a record year with 1.2 million EV sales in the U.S. Experts disagree on the slowdown narrative.
When I asked Andrew Cornelia, the CEO of Mercedes High Power Charging about what he thought of the “slowdown” during a roundtable with reporters, he said, “The number of different EVs that are coming to market year-over-year and the consumer demand and feedback are leading indicators [of sales].” He added, “We will continue to see growth within the market. The ‘slowdown’ is a zeitgeist that is biased and incorrect.”
Le indicated that the dealers needed to be more in sync with what the product offers, and what the policy intends to achieve. “Isn't that the entire point of a dealer? To convince a consumer to buy X or Y product?” he questioned. “They need to become far more customer-focused. Embrace the technology to make your job easier or it'll likely go away,” Le concluded.",Suvrat Kothari
Scout Motors Aims To Help Volkswagen Do What It's Never Done: Conquer America,https://insideevs.com/news/709267/scout-motors-factory-groundbreaking-vw/,"Company executives tell InsideEVs about the Scout SUV platform, plans for batteries and dealerships, and the ""electric slowdown.""",2024-02-20 13:30:56,"The forest site in Blythewood, South Carolina currently being cleared to make room for Scout Motors’ future electric truck and SUV factory is a very big deal on multiple fronts.
It’s the largest development the region has ever seen, estimated to bring some 4,000 jobs to produce 200,000 vehicles annually all for a projected $4.2 billion economic impact. It’s another feather in South Carolina’s manufacturing cap, following Volvo and BMW and turning the state into a burgeoning carmaking powerhouse.
And for Scout Motors’ parent company, the Volkswagen Group, it’s nothing short of a coup d'état; not just the revival of an iconic American brand, but a ground-up effort to make vehicles designed and engineered for Americans.
None of this gravity is lost on Scott Keogh, the fast-talking New York native picked to lead the effort. The last time I saw Keogh, he was the Volkswagen Group’s American CEO, and he was showing me the then-new ID.4—another car crucial to both VW’s electric goals and expansion in the U.S. market.
But as important as the ID.4 is, it’s almost a drop in the bucket compared to the impact Scout Motors hopes to make when the trucks enter production in late 2026.
“At the end of the day, ID.4 was a product, a product we loved,” Keogh told me at the factory groundbreaking last week. “Here, we’re starting from a completely blank slate.”
Keogh in front of a classic Scout. Photo: VW
A blank slate may be exactly what the Volkswagen Group needs as it attempts to become an all-electric automaker while reckoning with intense competition from China’s automakers on its home turf, and the fact that it’s never really cracked the American car market the way it’s wanted to.
That last part is exactly what Scout Motors aims to fix.
The original Scout was an SUV before SUVs were even a thing. Built by Illinois-based heavy equipment manufacturer International Harvester between 1960 and 1980, it predated famous 4x4s like the Ford Bronco by years and remains immensely popular with off-road enthusiasts and classic car collectors even today.
After acquiring International Harvester’s successor company Navistar in 2020, the VW Group found itself in possession of the Scout trademark. That got the wheels turning: what could be done with this famous brand? Executives in Germany “wanted a bigger presence in North America,” Keogh said, “and Scout had that credibility.”
To prove the Scout brand was up for the task, Keogh and other members of the Scout team brought board members to an airport hangar divided into three sections. Each had a different focus, including a lesson in the brand’s U.S. heritage and some early scale models—and, crucially, a business plan. Whatever they said in that hangar, it worked. “There was excitement, and it just rolled from there,” Keogh said.
That excitement yielded one of the most ambitious plans the company has ever executed, but it may be a necessary one.
The VW Group is the second-biggest carmaker on the planet behind Toyota, but that isn’t something we see in the U.S. The company commands some 25% of the new car market in Europe and 14% in China; in North America, that number is only about 4%.
Though VW has been here longer than any other “import” brand, and the VW Group sees handsome sales and profits from luxury divisions like Audi, Porsche and Bentley, it has never made the kind of cars Americans buy in volume—namely, big, capable trucks and SUVs.
A more watered-down version of the Scout might have yielded a sub-brand for Volkswagen, or a re-bodied ID.4 with some retro-truck flavor. But the company decided that wasn’t enough, and instead, Scout Motors had to be a kind of startup effort inside the VW Group: a new factory designed to take advantage of U.S. tax incentives, and a new body-on-frame truck platform built from scratch.
While Scout Motors will share considerable know-how, resources and some parts from its VW Group cousins, it is a new and independent effort. (For context around that 200,000 annual production goal, the Volkswagen brand sold about 329,000 cars in the U.S. last year.)
All of that ambition rides on a vehicle no one has seen yet, aside from some cursory sketches, and whose specs remain completely unknown. Keogh told InsideEVs that the Scout models could start in the high-$40,000 range, but otherwise they remain an enigma until their debut this summer.
But Keogh gave some hints in Blythewood: “This car, this platform, this everything was designed to compete here,” he said.
To do so, they wanted to build a proper SUV with off-roading credentials that lived up to the Scout name. “We're not building something to navigate the strip malls of America, we're building something to navigate America,” Keogh said. (He did later that potential exports to markets like China are a possibility as production ramps up.)
That off-road capability like you get in the Bronco or Jeep Wrangler—except powered by batteries, here—was key for Scout Motors. That’s why it’s slated to have locking differentials, tons of accessories at launch and actual, physical buttons instead of screen controls.
VW also tapped contract firm Magna Steyr, longtime maker of the Mercedes G-Class, to make something off-road-ready; that goal was also why modifying an existing electric platform didn’t work.
“We obviously gave this a lot of debate,” Keogh said of the plan to go body-on-frame. “We want to build something that's highly robust and highly capable. And I think Scouts came from that, so we thought it was smart to say, let's keep that integrity.” The result should be something like one of Rivian’s EVs, or the F-150 Lightning; it also will not be offered as a hybrid, even as VW has mulled releasing some of those stateside.
""This is not a twin, or a brother, or daughter to any of the other platforms that we've ever had,"" added Jan Spies, Scout Motors’ head of production and a longtime VW Group manufacturing executive.
That goes for the factory as well. Spies said the plant will pioneer various technologies and techniques that could be used across the rest of the conglomerate. When compared to existing factories that had to be converted for the era of “electromobility,” as Spies put it, this one is more designed from the get-go with environmental sustainability in mind.
“When it comes to innovation today, we think it's about making it workable for the next 20, 30 years,” Spies said. “We're here in a state where for example, water is not yet a resource that is counted as much as maybe in Mexico… but it will be one day.”
But many questions have to be answered in the next 2.5 years, provided the Scout Motors vehicles don’t face any delays.
For one, it is not known where the cars will source batteries from. Keogh said they won’t come from the SK Innovation plant in Georgia that supplies power cells to the Volkswagen ID.4, saying “they won’t work for a host of reasons I won’t get into.” In theory, the company may have its choice of suppliers as local battery production scales up across North America.
The company’s sales strategy is another unknown. It’s going to have dealerships, Keogh said, but they will not be attached to existing Volkswagen stores. He added during the roundtable discussion that future decisions on sales will be released later.
One can assume some Scout dealerships may end up attached to VW stores, but that won't happen by default. Furthermore, it feels unlikely a Volkswagen Group company would dip into some version of direct-to-consumer sales like Tesla and Rivian; doing so would likely draw the ire of their existing dealers. (Those VW dealers have already expressed some consternation since Scout Motors will be selling the kinds of trucks they have wanted to sell for years.)
Arguably a bigger question for Scout Motors may be what the EV market looks like in 2026. Last week’s factory groundbreaking ceremony came after a year of record electric sales in America, but one marked by a slowdown in recent months. Moreover, the president whose policies pushed EV adoption may not be in the White House in two years.
“We’re not naive to the headlines,” Keogh said. He added that the challenge of moving EVs in volume comes down to three things: costs, infrastructure and technology, meaning range, charging times and software. But he sees all three improving, even now.
“I think these three things are gonna line up quite well,” he said. “In my mind, I don't think salvation means, let's go let's go back, back, back. I think salvation is gonna come from constantly innovating and getting better technology. I’m an optimist on technology, and I’m an optimist on American technology.”

Japan's Automakers Shift Into Crisis Mode Over The EV Race,https://insideevs.com/news/709240/japan-evs-critical-materials/,"Also, Ford sounds the alarm on China too, and Scout is looking for cheaper batteries.",2024-02-19 10:21:12,"I was born in the 1980s, so for most of my life, it felt like all the best stuff was made in Japan. The most advanced electronics, the coolest video games and certainly the best cars. But the recession of the 1990s, the devastating earthquake in the early 2010s and a series of industry-wide technological choices have left Japan's auto industry scrambling to get ready for the electric vehicle future, despite being early pioneers in that field. Don't think the so-called EV sales slowdown is changing that situation one bit.
Plus, we hear more about how Ford is sounding the alarm over China, and the Volkswagen Group's new Scout Motors brand is looking for cheap batteries. You'll find all of those stories on today's Presidents' Day edition of our Critical Materials news roundup.
(Fun fact: George Washington never once drove an electric car. Really makes you think.)
Sure, the Japanese automakers—Toyota in particular—may be spiking the football over the slowing rate of EV adoption and hugely successful year of hybrid sales in 2023. But they aren't stupid. Far from it. America's fast-growing EV market is one thing, but what has them really spooked is their eroding market share in China and that country's homegrown EV industry getting into the export game in force.
Basically, everyone's gangster until BYD sets up a factory in your preferred backyard.
So what does Japan do here? Automotive News says a plan is forming among the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, a powerful lobbying group representing the big automakers (Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi.) And they want some government help to do it.
It's easy to balk at that, but EV growth has certainly been helped along by U.S. tax incentives and initiatives, and China's government basically bankrolled that stuff for years. If a government wants to protect one of its most important industries and employment sectors, it has to invest and get protectionist.
For Japan, that means extra collaboration among rivals; building up a local battery and semiconductor industry; and expanding green energy sources, because the country is inherently wary of plug-in cars after the Fukushima nuclear disaster showed both the weaknesses of its grid and drove a pivot back to fossil fuel power sources. From that story:
This year, new labor regulations restrict the work hours of truck drivers. Combined with an overall labor shortage, this pinches Japan's finely tuned just-in-time production system. Automakers are looking to alleviate the shortage and introduce mobility businesses that might keep the factories running like clockwork. The focus will be on electrification, software-defined vehicles and better energy management.
[...] Efforts to go carbon neutral will only be successful if the industry's energy is clean. That means finding eco-friendly fuel to power vehicles and the factories that make them. Japan must pivot to renewable resources such as wind and water. And it must tap new ideas such as ammonia-fired thermal power plants, industrial scale hydrogen electrolysis and carbon dioxide recirculation.
JAMA is still pushing hydrogen, interestingly enough, and wants to promote ""hydrogen stops for fuel cell vehicles and even hydrogen combustion vehicles."" A lot of that is due to the immense strength of Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, and how it continues to play the long game on that technology. Worth a read in full.
It's an ambitious plan and one that needs to start moving immediately. I'd love to see another 1980s-style boom in Japanese automotive technology, but the country isn't running on free money anymore.
I've said before that despite its many challenges and wider skepticism, Ford Motor Company is doing more and better on the EV and software front than it gets credit for. But clearly, it has no business getting complacent.
If EV adoption goes in waves, we may be seeing the ending to one—the rollout of the volume-selling Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, more and better new cars available, the start of record sales and the buildup of a charging infrastructure—before a second one begins. I think that next wave will start in the next year or two, and it will be marked with the race to solid-state or cheaper batteries, cheaper EVs all around and the entry of companies like BYD into the U.S. market.
At a panel last week, the chief operating officer of Ford's EV division didn't allude to Round Two directly, but he alluded to the fierce competition headed our way soon. From The Detroit News:
""That's coming here eventually,"" Marin Gjaja, Ford Model e's COO, said during a panel on disruptive technology held by the automaker. ""So, we better get fit now and better get going on EVs, or we don't have a future.""
[...] “I don't know exactly the timing, but I think they're going to end up here,” Gjaja said, “just as the Japanese ended up here. The Koreans ended up here. The Germans ended up here. It's a big market.”
“The size of the market in China is so big that those players are going to be in a position to go potentially dominate the world, unless we as Ford and other OEMs can respond,” Gjaja said. “Think about all of the capital: the human capital, physical capital, financial capital that’s built into these ecosystems to build vehicles — that is all being massively disrupted, because this technology is progressing so fast.”
Ford is smart to get ready for this. There's still a lot of lingering skepticism about the EV future in America's auto industry in general—and a gulf between what executives say publicly and what they really believe—but they are increasingly freaked out by BYD.
If the Chinese automakers serve as this kind of Baba Yaga figure to scare ours into action, then so be it. Because if America were to slow down the fuel economy rules that were driving greater EV adoption, the auto industry would be extremely foolish to take that as a pass to just make more gas trucks and SUVs forever.
Don't think this EV sales slowdown (which, again, I think is overblown) means a slowdown in EV investments. The Scout Motors factory in South Carolina is a very big deal for parent company Volkswagen Group; we'll have more on that this week at InsideEVs.
In the meantime, the electric Scout SUV and pickup truck need cheaper batteries. The ones built by SK Innovation in Georgia for the VW ID.4 won't work for that new Scout platform; I know this because I asked about it.
Where those batteries will come from remains a mystery. Here's Bloomberg:
Scout Motors Inc., the new US electric vehicle brand backed by Volkswagen AG, is seeking out low-cost battery technology so it can reach mainstream buyers with the sport-utility vehicle it has coming in three years.
With American buyers balking at the high price of electric vehicles, Scout has been scouring battery sources for the most cost-efficient options as it prepares to build 200,000 SUVs and plug-in pickup trucks at a new $2 billion factory it broke ground on Thursday in South Carolina.
“We’re in this startup position and we’re able to pivot,” Scout Chief Executive Officer Scott Keogh said in an interview. “We are looking at battery chemistry and different battery options to decide what to go with and what’s going to give us the best trade off of range and cost.”
The first Scout Motors EVs are expected to roll off the assembly line in late 2026, so as they work on the factory and the cars, they may have time. Two-and-a-half years will be a lifetime in battery development in the U.S., both in terms of sourcing and chemistries.
Toyota has been disappointing to a lot of EV fans, but I wouldn't count out its electric plans—even as I wish it'd do more to make its current lineup a bit more competitive. It also owns or part-owns damn near the entire Japanese auto industry supply chain, so I think it's positioned to do well in the future if it acts now. Subaru and Mazda will probably get led by whatever direction Toyota takes.
As for Nissan, who the heck knows; it still seems to be steeped in chaos these days. Honda is the wild card here.
Do you have faith in Japan's automakers, or are you more skeptical of their long-term prospects?

Biden Administration May Relax EPA Rules Driving Electric Vehicles: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/709077/biden-epa-rollback-nyt/,"Potentially bowing to dealer, automaker and union pressure, the Biden Administration may back off rules leading to wider EV adoption.",2024-02-17 14:52:19,"In recent years, the American car market has been pushed toward becoming a significantly more electric one by the Biden Administration's strict Environmental Protection Agency rules. Those car tailpipe emission rules are so strict that they could result in two-thirds of all new cars having emissions at all by 2032. But now, after months of pressure from automakers, dealers, labor unions and the other side of the political aisle, the White House may ease up on that plan—a move that will sure to draw the ire of EV proponents and anyone sounding the alarm over global warming.
This report comes from the New York Times, citing three unnamed officials said to be familiar with the plan. The exact details of this plan are not known, except that a ""sharp increase"" in EV sales would not be required ""until after 2030.""
The new EPA rules are expected to be finalized this spring, the Times reports.
America's EV ramp-up hasn't been easy
The race to go all-electric across the globe is pushed by emissions regulations designed to fight climate change. But car dealers, automakers and even owners have often struggled to adapt, even as sales hit new records.
If so, the move could have profound effects on the future of the EV industry, America's ability to compete against a rising electric China, and a signature Biden policy achievement as he faces a tough reelection battle.
From the Times:
The E.P.A. designed the proposed regulations so that 67 percent of sales of new cars and light-duty trucks would be all-electric by 2032, up from 7.6 percent in 2023, a radical remaking of the American automobile market.
That remains the goal. But as they finalize the regulations, administration officials are tweaking the plan to slow the pace at which auto manufacturers would need to comply, so that electric vehicle sales would increase more gradually through 2030 but then would have to sharply rise.
The change in pacing is in response to automakers who say that more time is needed to build a national network of charging stations and to bring down the cost of electric vehicles, and to labor unions that want more time to try to unionize new electric car plants that are opening around the country, particularly in the South.
Last year was a landmark one for EV sales, with all-electric cars making up 7.6% of the market and record sales from every brand. But the rate of EV adoption slowed down toward the end of the year, moving less quickly than the industry anticipated. The so-called ""EV slowdown"" is often overblown, but the transition has been hampered by combatant car dealers, a largely inadequate public charging network, intense political opposition and concerns about how the cars operate differently than gas-powered ones.
The transition to EVs has been especially fraught for automakers, who are spending immense amounts of capital to pivot to battery-powered and software-driven cars—and even for the EV startups that face their own challenges. Moreover, many analysts and industry officials have said EVs haven't yet had the ""breakthrough"" moment that will allow them to become cheaper to buy, while driving further, to meet more Americans' needs.
But if the Biden Administration does in fact back off its 2030 targets, it raises serious questions about the future of an industry undergoing its biggest transformation since the creation of the assembly line. (Former President Donald Trump, Biden's likely opponent in November, has vowed to undo those regulations entirely and told EV supporters they can ""rot in hell"" last Christmas.)
Countless EV plants, battery factories and equipment manufacturing hubs either have been built or are being built to meet this electric future—worth some 200,000 new jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in investments. While those certainly aren't going to evaporate, uncertainty about an EV future isn't great for them.
Furthermore, the Chinese automakers are seen as an existential threat to every other established car company; even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sounded the alarm there. Those automakers, led by BYD, have developed highly advanced and low-cost EVs, and many are getting ready to move into the U.S. market via Mexican factories unless new restrictions somehow keep them out. Giving automakers a pass, essentially, to ""slow down"" on EVs raises serious questions about their ability to compete against China long-term.
Finally, there's the climate question.
The race to electrify America's auto market has been a key component of the Biden Administration's goal of cutting the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050. Nearly all experts say that dialing back zero-emission cars will continue to lead to the most drastic and damaging effects of global warming, something echoed by the Times today:
Postponing the sharp increase in electric vehicle sales until after 2030 would still eliminate roughly the same amount of auto emissions as the original proposal by 2055, according to E.P.A. models. But it would mean the nation would continue to pump auto emissions into the atmosphere in the short run. Scientists say every year counts in the government’s efforts to prevent the planet from tipping into more deadly and costly climate disasters.
“You’ll have faster warming if U.S. transportation emissions don’t decline before 2030,” said James Glynn, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
Scientists have warned that if average global temperatures increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels, humans would struggle to adapt to increasingly violent storms, floods, fires, heat waves and other disruptions.
But if the Biden Administration does agree to dial back its EV goals, they key questions will be: by how much, and to do what instead? How the auto industry responds to all of that will be key to its future—and in part, to the planet's future as well.

The Toyota bZ4X Is Depreciating Massively. But Why?,https://insideevs.com/news/708850/toyota-bz4x-depreciation-story/,We spoke with two automotive experts to find out what's going on with the e-TNGA EV prices.,2024-02-15 17:00:01,"Toyota and Subaru products have some of the best resale values of any mass-market cars. In the luxury world, Lexus vehicles hold onto their values better than products from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and others. But while that holds for internal-combustion cars, the depreciation curve is different for the brands’ early electric efforts. The Toyota bZ4X, Subaru Solterra, and Lexus RZ all lie within that category.
The Toyota and Subaru start in the mid-$40,000 range, around the same price as many competitors such as the Kia EV6, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Tesla Model Y. Despite their solid brand reputations, used examples seem to depreciate rapidly. Secondhand car shoppers can easily find used bZ4X and Solterras in the low $30,000 range. More fascinatingly, many of these examples have a few thousand, if not hundreds of miles on their odometers. Savvy buyers might just find themselves in a lightly used example for thousands off sticker.
There are plenty of heavily depreciated examples floating around on TrueCar. One 2023 bZ4X Limited went for $50,130 when it was new. Now, with 5,000 miles on the odometer, it's listed for $32,673. That's 34.8 percent depreciation despite being put into service eight months ago. Things are no better for its luxurious stablemate. The 2023 Lexus RZ450e Luxury started at $65,150 when new. Today, low demand in the used market means this example with 5,000 miles has been sitting on the lot for 90 days. The sleek EV now features a $43,995 tag along with a comprehensive CPO warranty.  That’s 32.5 percent less than what it was when new.
But why?
There is no question of whether Toyota can make great electrified (i.e. hybrid) vehicles. Toyota pioneered the hybrid powertrain in the late 1990s with the Prius. (Honda was first to the U.S. market, but its Insight never caught on the way the Prius did.) Toyota currently offers 12 hybrids and two plug-in hybrids in the United States market. Lexus offers seven hybrids and three plug-in hybrids—that's 24 different hybrids to choose from. Toyota and Lexus buyers have plenty of choices when buying a hybrid, from sports coupes to minivans. But what about EVs?
Toyota first sold an EV in the U.S. back in 1997. The RAV4 EV was an electric version of the RAV4 sold to appease the California Air Resource Board. After selling and leasing 1,484 RAV4 EVs in the state, Toyota ended the program in 2003. Toyota revived the RAV4 EV as a 2012 model year through a joint venture with Tesla. Like its predecessor, it was short-lived, ending production in 2014. That wasn't the end of Toyota's EV journey, though.
Toyota revealed the bZ4X, its first dedicated EV, in 2021, and deliveries began the subsequent year. Toyota shared the bZ4X's underpinnings (referred to as the e-TNGA platform) with the similarly priced but AWD-only Subaru Solterra and the more upstream Lexus RZ. The bZ4X starts at $44,420 and comes with front-wheel-drive as standard. It features a 71.4- or 72.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack with a 201-horsepower single-motor setup or a dual-motor one pushing 215 horses. It offers between 222 and 252 miles of EPA range and up to 150 kilowatts of DC power.
2024 Toyota bZ4X: Starting at $44,420
2024 Subaru Solterra: Starting at $46,340
2024 Lexus RZ300e: Starting at $55,150
These specs aren't worth writing home about. Moreover, last year's Solterra and bZ4X only came with 100kW DC fast charging capabilities. In a real-world charging test done by our friends at Out Of Spec Studios, the 2023 bZ4X AWD fell completely flat. It reached a maximum charge rate of 88 kilowatts and required over four hours to reach a 99 percent state-of-charge. The bZ4X shouldn't be your first choice when looking for an electric road tripper.
Regarding the Lexus RZ450e's 196-mile range, an independent 70-mile-per-hour showed a real-world range of just 172 miles. Other EVs, especially some Tesla models, miss the mark in terms of real-world range. In our 2020 Tesla Model Y range test, we saw 276 miles against an EPA range of 316. A real range of 276 miles is a noticeable decrease, but the Model Y is still highly usable for road trips. A car with 172 miles of range, meanwhile, won’t cut it for some buyers. In other words, the e-TNGA EVs offer subpar range and charging at price points that look bonkers compared to other electric crossovers.
Let's look at the Toyota RAV4 Prime, a plug-in hybrid version of the ubiquitious Toyota RAV4. It debuted as a 2021 model year with a $39,220 price tag (now $45,040). They've proven to hold onto their values exceptionally well. The cheapest sub-50,000-mile example in the country is a 2021 listed for $32,273 with 44,000 miles. It dropped 17.7% of its value in two years of being on the road. The bZ4X we referenced saw a 34.8 percent depreciation in eight months.
The Lexus NX450h+ plug-in hybrid has similarly low depreciation. The least expensive 2023 model is priced at $55,988 with 16,000 miles. Against an original price tag of $62,075, the PHEV Lexus dropped around 9.8 percent in value in 11 months. The RZ450e with 11,000 fewer miles saw 32.5 depreciation in 7 months. While it's difficult to find models that are precisely the same in mileage and age, it's clear that these EVs aren't holding their values well.
""This may certainly seem alarming, given that in general Lexus products typically hold their value very well once in the used market. Consumer confidence in and sentiment of a ‘used EV’ likely isn't as strong as that of a proven ICE or hybrid product,"" wrote Robby DeGraff of the automotive consulting firm AutoPacific. ""While the RZ is no doubt an attractive, upscale product for the brand and serves as Lexus's gateway to an EV future, compared to other similar posh EVs, it really lags behind the competition when it comes to range and value.""
DeGraff's point touched upon two things: buyer sentiment towards EVs and the e-TNGA vehicles' arguably lousy value propositions. Most buyers contemplating purchasing an electric car are likely going to consider the big names—Tesla, Hyundai, and Kia—not Toyota, Lexus, and Subaru.
""Perhaps (consumers are) not as up to speed and aware of the brand's EV efforts, which at this point in time, is still very much in its infancy. Toyota is so synonymous with ‘hybrids’ for many consumers, and that's likely to be the case going forward,"" DeGraff wrote to InsideEVs. ""In our latest 2023 Future Attribute Demand Study in which we poll new vehicle intenders, 41% of future Toyota buyers intend to buy a regular ICE and roughly 32% a hybrid or PHEV. Intention for EVs among future Toyota buyers is only 21%.""
Moreover, in the used car market, there are more hybrids and plug-in hybrids floating around than EVs. More options and more consumer confidence with hybrids are keeping their values higher. ""It's important to keep in mind that consumers are warming up to EVs but not at the rapid-fire pace that automakers had been keeping their fingers crossed for. While EV market share and sales continue to rise year-over-year, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter… the majority of consumers, new and used, are still ICE intenders and purchasers,"" said DeGraff. ""We're not quite at a point yet where there's massive demand for both new and especially used EVs, therefore pricing on used ones isn't going to be as competitive.""
While EVs depreciate more, something must be said about the e-TNGA EVs. Slow charging times, mediocre range, and subpar performance really distance these vehicles from their electric crossover counterparts. ""Especially because this technology is moving so quickly, their value will be in just the fact that they are like… a car,"" said Cars & Bids founder Doug DeMuro. ""I guarantee you that within 48 months, maybe 60 months, Solterras will be 12 grand because they're trash.""
While these crossovers are Toyota and Subaru's foray into the EV space, they miss the mark all around. Consequently, used ones are depreciating rapidly, an outlier among their respective brands' vehicles. Electric cars tend to depreciate more in general, so it's no surprise that uncompetitive models lose value quickly. Before you hop on one as a bargain used car, remember that we still don’t know how low they’ll go. You don’t want to be the one holding the bag at the bottom.

"After Passing Tesla, China's BYD Eyes Mexico Plant For U.S. Sales",https://insideevs.com/news/708540/byd-mexico-tesla-china/,China's EV champion seems dead-set on U.S. sales sooner than later.,2024-02-13 17:00:18,"It's the worst-kept secret in the automotive world, if you can even call it a secret anymore: leading Chinese plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle manufacturer BYD wants to build a factory in Mexico that would give it a theoretical base of entry into the United States market. BYD is already selling cars in Mexico; why not make them there too, right? And today, a top BYD executive revealed a few more details about this potential expansion plan.
Zhou Zou, the country manager of BYD Mexico, told Nikkei Asia in Mexico City that BYD ""is considering"" setting up a plant in Mexico, explicitly as an export hub to the U.S. Granted, there have been rumblings about this move before, but this is one of the more direct times a BYD official has weighed in on the plan.
China's automakers have global dreams
China's automakers all have global ambitions, and not by selling cars with traditional gasoline engines. Steep tariffs keep cars from companies like BYD out of the U.S. market for now, but little is stopping them from getting around those rules with factories in Mexico.
Nikkei Asia reports that BYD has launched a ""feasibility study"" for a Mexican plant, a facility that would join its growing manufacturing presence in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. After record sales of more than 3 million cars in 2023—including passing Tesla in all-electric vehicle sales for the first time ever—BYD is keen to expand into Latin America, Europe and other parts of Asia.  Zou told the Japanese newspaper that Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula are among the leading candidates for a factory location in that country.
Doing so would help strengthen BYD's presence in Mexico and Latin America, where it is already starting to see strong sales. But a far greater victory for a Mexican plant would be its use as an entry point into the American market, where many automakers are either struggling with or dialing back their electric vehicle plans as demand proves more uncertain than expected.
The biggest thing keeping BYD out of the U.S. for now is steep 27.5% tariffs on Chinese-made cars. But cars made in Mexico are not subject to those same tariffs even if they come from a Chinese-owned company. I wrote ""in theory"" up top because it's certainly possible that U.S. lawmakers could find some way to impose more restrictions on even Mexican-built Chinese cars, but for now, that's not the case.
To put it simply: BYD is a leader in global electric vehicle sales and technology whose car prices seriously undercut most rivals, and a Mexican factory would open the floodgates to those cars competing for buyers with Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Nissan and the rest. And the seriousness of that potential street fight is increasingly weighing on automotive executives in America, many of whom worry they aren't prepared for such a battle. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently expressed fears that Chinese automakers would ""demolish"" rivals without trade barriers in place.
Granted, none of this is an official confirmation from BYD that a Mexican plant is coming; not yet, anyway. But it is further evidence that the plan seems quite likely, even in spite of high interest rates, an uncertain economy and questions over EV demand in the U.S.
Moreover, as Nikkei Asia reports, it is more proof of how Mexico is quickly becoming a major EV manufacturing hub in the Western Hemisphere. Kia, BMW, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford are either building EVs there now or quickly ramping them up to take advantage of lower labor costs as all of them chase more affordable electric cars.
The question now is: will they be able to fend off BYD when, and likely not if, the company comes to the U.S.?

Tesla Made $1.79 Billion In 2023 Just From Selling EV Credits To Other Carmakers,https://insideevs.com/news/708342/tesla-reguatory-credits-1-79-billion-2023/,Saving the world’s automakers from fines made Tesla nearly $9 billion since 2009.,2024-02-12 12:01:57,"Besides making a pretty penny from selling all-electric cars, Tesla is raking in a nice profit just from selling regulatory credits to other car companies around the world.
Last year, the Elon Musk-led EV maker cashed in on $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue, according to Automotive News, with the cumulative total from this source of income reaching almost $9 billion since 2009.
Making money from EV credits
Tesla made almost $9 billion in revenue since 2009 just from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. Last year, the American company made $1.79 billion from selling papers to car manufacturers that can't stay below certain emissions limits for new-car fleets.
Regulatory credits are bought by automakers from across the world that have new-vehicle fleet emissions above those set by the local authorities in places like China, the European Union, and the state of California.

In other words, the average emissions of a carmaker’s portfolio have to slip under a certain limit in order to avoid a hefty fine. But how do you stay under the limit if you only make gas- and diesel-burning cars? Well, you buy some credits from companies that only make zero-emissions cars and legally get away with it.
We don’t know how much money Tesla made from each individual automaker buying credits, but it’s good business for the American EV manufacturer. However, in the grand scheme of things, selling a lifeline to carmakers that don’t build more EVs isn’t as big of a deal as one would expect. In 2023, Tesla reported total revenue from the automotive business of $82.4 billion, meaning regulatory credits amount to just 1.4%.
That said, it’s almost like free money for Tesla, as there’s little to no associated cost to selling the credits, making the sales virtually pure profit, Automotive News writes.
A Tesla Model X charging at a Supercharger
Last year, Tesla and its U.S.-based battery-making partner Panasonic also received between $900 and $1,400 in government subsidies for every EV sold here thanks to the battery tax credits put in place by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Back in 2020, Tesla’s then-CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said during the July earnings call that the American company isn’t managed based on the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future. “It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce,” he added.
But while optimism was rampant in 2020 when it came to the rate at which the EV market would grow, recent developments might help Tesla continue to make good money off of regulatory credits as several automakers have significantly slowed down their EV output and toned down their enthusiasm on the EV market’s growth rate. This means that fewer EVs will hit the road in the coming months, and Tesla will keep selling regulatory credits to manufacturers that bet on combustion to keep the lights on.",Iulian Dnistran
"Tire Wear Is Especially Bad For Electric Vehicles, J.D. Power Says",https://insideevs.com/news/708011/ev-reliability-jd-power-2024/,Rankings for electric vehicles plummeted in J.D. Power's recent dependability study.,2024-02-12 09:00:08,"Long-term vehicle dependability has declined across the automotive industry, consumer insights and data analytics firm J.D. Power said in its recently released 2024 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study. Particularly striking is electric cars ranking far below their gas-powered counterparts. Higher tire wear is a ""sore spot"" for EVs, and smartphone apps are troublesome, leading to a lower dependability score, J.D. Power said.
The study found that the owners of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids experienced far more problems than gas cars. On average, ICE cars experienced 187 problems per 100 vehicles, PHEVs witnessed 216 problems, while BEVs fared far worse with a score of 256 problems per 100 vehicles over three years of ownership. Lexus and Toyota were the least troublesome—which is hardly a surprise—while Tesla fared rather poorly.
To measure the dependability of a brand, J.D. Power analyzed nine major problems reported by owners, including driver assistance features, driving experience, exterior, infotainment, interior, powertrain, and seats among others.
It's worth noting that this data has some limitations. We only have information regarding tires and infotainment systems for this story. J.D. Power hasn't said much about the reliability of batteries, drivetrain, and range and performance in its report. So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison with gas cars. There are several variables outlined later in the story that should be considered before drawing any conclusions about EVs.
In a nutshell, it's best to approach this data with caution.
Thirty-nine percent of BEV owners said they had to replace their tires at least once in the past 12 months, compared to just 20% of gas car owners admitting the same.
“That's something to be concerned about. [EV buyers] are going to save money at the gas pump, but the trade-off is that they would have to replace tires more often. So, it's a cost of ownership issue you need to think about,” Frank Hanley, the senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power, told InsideEVs.
Several reasons can lead to higher tire degradation in EVs. For starters, EVs require less maintenance due to fewer components and less complex drivetrains. That impacts tires. By not taking your EV to service, you might not rotate the tires as frequently as you would in a gas car. That could especially be true if you’re unaware of the required tire maintenance intervals.
Routinely rotating your tires evens the spread of wear, and it maximizes tread life, Bridgestone and several other tire manufacturers have said.
EVs are also generally heavier than gas cars due to hefty batteries that demand higher tire weight ratings. The instant torque from the electric motors, a trademark feature of EVs that many enthusiasts love, also leads to more tire wear—e-motors deliver torque more precisely and quickly to individual wheels with micro-adjustments to optimize traction at all times.
There's no reason for the tire issue to ring any alarm bells because tire technology seems on track to develop over time. And you could minimize the wear by following simple textbook rules.
Flooring the throttle to devour the instant torque at every green light will likely cost you in the long run. But if you monitor tire pressure regularly, rotate tires according to the OEM's recommended schedule, and drive efficiently overall, you could prolong the life of the tires.
The study also found that faulty smartphone apps lowered the dependability rankings for EVs. Hanley added that EV owners are a lot more smartphone-dependent than gas-car owners. “Smartphones for gas cars are like a nice-to-have, versus for EVs, they’re sort of a lifeline,” Hanley said.
EV owners tend to use smartphones to check battery status, adjust climate settings, and locate charging stations, among other functions. In theory, the apps are meant to give owners more control over their EV remotely and make tasks more convenient. But in the real world, they don't seem to be flawlessly integrated, at least not yet.
Without mentioning any carmaker or model, Hanley added that EV owners reported issues where apps didn’t connect to the car, weren’t updated with the correct information and even displayed wrong data. Across the industry, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and voice assistants caused the most trouble for vehicle owners.
CarPlay and Android Auto often suffer from bad connections, poor rendering, and slow responses, a General Motors spokesperson told MotorTrend in December 2023. These issues prompt owners to use their smartphones instead, thereby defeating the purpose of mirroring these apps and elevating safety risks.
That’s one of the reasons GM dropped CarPlay and Android Auto from its future cars, MotorTrend said. Instead, GM’s new “Ultifi” infotainment system will get a full suite of inbuilt Google apps.
Other factors causing a lower dependability score include outdated maps, improper installation of over-the-air updates, and poor wireless charging pads, J.D. Power told InsideEVs. Hanley agreed that software-defined vehicles are likely to continue having connectivity issues until the technology matures and is seamlessly integrated.
This study hardly spells doom for EVs. EVs constituted only 2.5% of the sample size (approximately 750 cars). Furthermore, the majority of these EVs were MY2021 Teslas, making the data somewhat outdated.
A recent Consumer Reports reliability survey also concluded that EVs were worse off on the reliability index. But it added that EVs in their first model year faced more issues with motors, charging systems, and batteries. Tesla slotted in the middle of the pack, much higher than it did in the J.D. Power survey.
EVs generally tend to improve over time, and Tesla especially has a track record of bettering its cars over the years. The Model 3 is in its seventh year (the first year for the Highland facelift), while the Model Y is in its fourth year.
Yes, frequent tire replacements might indeed increase the cost of ownership. But even then, net savings will likely be positive. A CNBC estimate suggested that a Model Y owner could save over $11,000 over five years in maintenance and gas savings compared to an Audi Q5 owner.
A set of Goodyear Electric GT tires for the Model Y costs about $1200. Even if you replace them twice the number of times as a gas car, your net savings can still be higher. That's the worst-case scenario—one that you probably won't encounter if you take good care of the tires in the first place.

All said, the study highlights the steep learning curve for EV owners, and how important education would be for wider adoption of EVs. Not only should you be aware of the best practices for charging and how to maximize range, but also of the less obvious stuff, such as conserving tire health over time.",Suvrat Kothari
Toyota Steps Up Investment For Three-Row Electric SUV Built In Kentucky,https://insideevs.com/news/707647/toyota-boosts-investment-kentucky-plant-for-bevs/,The plant gets another $1.3 billion and a new battery assembly line.,2024-02-06 16:00:40,"Toyota announced an additional $1.3 billion of investment at its Georgetown, Kentucky plant today. The brand said in a statement that the investment will be earmarked for assembling its upcoming three-row electric SUV for the U.S. market.
The new investment will also support the construction of a new battery assembly line. This complements Toyota's plans to assemble batteries at its North Carolina facility. With this latest investment, Toyota's commitment to electrification in the U.S. amounts to nearly $10 billion.
Toyota steps up its U.S. electrification efforts
Toyota has long been accused of being an intentional latecomer to the EV game, with company leadership favoring hydrogen and hybrid cars. It's had a ton of success lately with the latter, but may now be coming around on full EVs.
Much of that investment has gone into developing the upcoming Kia EV9 challenger, which Toyota says will enter production by 2025.
At Toyota's Beyond Zero summit in 2021, the automaker announced its plan to launch 30 BEVs globally by 2030. One of those concepts was labeled “bZ Large SUV.” The new model for North America is likely related to that and is rumored to be named the bZ5x.
Toyota's largest global manufacturing site in Georgetown, Kentucky
After decades of building combustion and hybrid cars, Toyota is a late bloomer in the EV race. There’s only one Toyota-branded pure electric car sold in the U.S., the bZ4x. The Subaru Solterra and the Lexus RZ 450e are the same underneath but wear different clothes.
The new investment comes as part of Toyota's multi-pronged approach to electrification. That approach includes promoting self-charging hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Toyota will also continue to invest in combustion engines.
Jack Hollis, Toyota Motor North America’s head of sales, doubled down on this approach recently. “Our dealers are not telling us that the customer wants EVs more than other things. They’re telling us they want EVs as a choice,” he said at a NADA conference last week.

Toyota: We Make Hybrids Because Customers Want Them,https://insideevs.com/news/707483/toyota-hybrids-customers-want-them/,"The automaker has been criticized for being a laggard in the EV-only game, but it might have the last laugh.",2024-02-06 11:00:23,"Toyota, the Japanese company that currently sells just one all-electric vehicle in the United States–the bZ4X crossover–is known in hardline electric car enthusiast groups as being a laggard in transitioning to a fully electric portfolio.
The Japanese automaker even went on record through the voice of its main science man Gill Pratt last year, who said that EV-only extremists are wrong and that in the long run, a diversified powertrain approach will win–both for the environment and for the customers.
Toyota's bet on hybrids and plug-in hybrids might pay off
Toyota has long touted that its diversified powertrain approach is the best solution both for the environment and its customers. And while the EV market experiences a slowdown in growth, Toyota's strategy might pay off, at least when it comes to sales.
His reasoning was that most people usually don’t need the massive batteries that are fitted to long-range EVs. As such, resources are wasted on batteries that aren’t used at their full potential. The solution, in Toyota’s eyes? Spread the same materials that would go into a big battery across multiple, smaller batteries that are part of hybrid or plug-in hybrid setups.
Toyota has since changed its stance on EVs and is planning a full lineup of next-gen vehicles that could offer upwards of 621 miles of range on a full charge by the end of this decade. But even with a renewed appetite for all-electric cars, Toyota isn’t giving up on its diversified powertrain approach, which might actually give it the upper hand in terms of sales as the growth in the EV-only segment slows, at least in the short term.
The reason for this multipronged strategy, as the Nippon manufacturer calls it, boils down to the customer. In short, people don’t want EVs any more than they want plug-in hybrids, hydrogen-powered cars, and even gasoline-only vehicles.
More Toyota Stories
That’s what Toyota North America’s head of sales, Jack Hollis, said during the Automotive News Retail Forum: NADA last week. “Our strategy is based on what dealers are telling us the customer wants,” Hollis said. “Our dealers are not telling us that the customer wants EVs more than other things. They’re telling us they want EVs as a choice. They want plug-in hybrids as a choice. They want hydrogen as a choice. In fact, they would like to have gas engines [as a choice] but also have cleaner-burning fuels,” Toyota’s executive vice president of sales added.
Furthermore, through the voice of Jack Hollis, Toyota is concerned that regulation which will require a major shift toward all-electric vehicles by the end of the decade might not work out as lawmakers intended because if customers won’t be more willing to choose a battery-powered car instead of a combustion one.
“Regulations are way out in front of where the customer is at,” Hollis said. “That never works well for any industry. The customers have to lead, the regulations have to be able to protect them. Not the other way around.”
But aren’t these regulations meant exactly for the customers, in the sense that they’ll be able to breathe cleaner air when they step outside? And shouldn’t manufacturers and dealers step up their game when it comes to educating their customers about the benefits of getting an all-electric car as opposed to opting for the default, gas-powered solution?
These are all valid questions but for the consumer who doesn’t have $40,000 to spend on a new EV, they get relegated to the bottom of the priorities list. And not everybody wants a Tesla, for various reasons, even if the Model 3 and Model Y are among the most affordable EVs in the United States now.
So it makes sense that shoppers who want a new car but can’t afford an EV would go for a cheaper hybrid or plug-in hybrid. The Tesla Model 3 starts at $38,990 without the destination charge. The Toyota Corolla hybrid? $23,500. The bigger Prius goes from $27,950.
And it’s this price gap that might help Toyota keep its crown as the best-selling car manufacturer in the world as the EV market experiences a slowdown in growth. The same Jack Hollis said that the percentage of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold by Toyota and Lexus in the U.S. would continue to rise above the record-high 29% it recorded last year.",Iulian Dnistran
Dealers Say 'Slow Down' On EVs. But The Sales Numbers Say Otherwise,https://insideevs.com/news/706308/ev-dealer-biden-slowdown-2023/,Last year was an exceptionally good one for EV sales. So why are so many car dealers still not onboard?,2024-02-02 14:02:18,"Last year emerged as a record-breaking one for electric vehicle sales in the U.S., defying the prevalent narrative of dwindling EV demand. Automakers sold over one million pure-electric models in 2023, a nearly 50% increase compared to the year before. Sure, Tesla grabbed the lion's share of this pie, but it's worth noting that every car company that sells EVs in the U.S. also had a standout year of EV and PHEV sales.
However, the EV sales records coincide with something else—U.S. car dealers have orchestrated a staunch rebellion against EVs. After writing a letter to President Biden in November 2023, urging him to “tap the brakes” on the Environmental Protection Agency’s new emissions proposal, dealers last week wrote a second letter to Biden.
This time, the request was not to tap the brakes but to slam them.
Car dealers request President Biden to pause EPA mandate again
The Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. government's agency that establishes national pollution control standards, wants to increase the share of EV sales substantially by 2032. But car dealers have opposed this plan, citing low consumer demand among several other roadblocks.
The dealers—after getting no apparent response from the Biden Administration to their first letter—say in their second letter that “[i]t is uncontestable that the combination of fewer tax incentives, a woefully inadequate charging infrastructure, and insufficient consumer demand makes the proposed EV mandate completely unrealistic.”
The EPA is expected to finalize an ambitious and aggressive plan this year to slash emissions. Outlined over 262 pages, it has stated how the new regulations will remove millions of metric tons of particulate matter, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, diesel exhaust, and air toxics by imposing restrictions on the sales of gasoline- and diesel-powered light- and heavy-duty vehicles.
The EPA is proposing to achieve this by increasing the share of light-duty EV sales to 67%, and commercial EV sales to 25% by 2032. Thousands of dealers across the country detest this plan. Some of their concerns are undoubtedly valid, like the fact that only 19 models qualify for the federal tax credits this year, compared to 43 last year, leaving customers with far fewer options.
This is because the U.S. Department of Treasury has revised its guidance surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act, encouraging automakers to establish a localized EV supply chain. This is aimed at further reducing reliance on China for critical components like batteries, leaving dozens of models ineligible with their current components and supply chains.
However, that's changing quickly. Several models are expected to regain their eligibility for tax credits in the coming months—the Volkswagen ID.4 recently qualified, and General Motors is optimistic that the Lyriq and Blazer EV will qualify as well. While the concerns around fewer tax incentives and inadequate charging infrastructure are true, the claim about insufficient consumer demand looks shaky.
In 2023, U.S. automakers rolled out EVs off their assembly lines at a record pace. The total sales of rechargeable models—including BEVs, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles—amounted to 1.4 million. Of this pie, 1.1 million were fully electric models. Mercedes-Benz saw its U.S. EV sales rise by a record 139%. Volkswagen Group’s EV sales surged by 61%. Ford delivered over 72,000 EVs, a new record. Most other OEMs, including Volvo, Nissan, and the Hyundai Motor Group, saw their BEV sales soar.
More EV News
So why are the dealers pushing back against EVs? Inadequate charging infrastructure is one persistent issue. There’s also the fact that 43% of dealer profits emerge from parts, labor, and service, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2019—EVs have fewer components and require far less maintenance.
That’s not the only reason they can represent a threat to dealer balance sheets. A skewed supply-demand ratio has increased the time EVs spend on dealer lots. By the end of November 2023, EV inventory levels reached a new high with 114 days of supply, Cox Automotive’s data showed. This is more than double the 53-day supply from the same period in November 2022. (Data excludes Tesla and Rivian due to their direct-to-consumer sales model.)
This is one of the reasons that prompted Ford to cut its production targets for the F-150 Lightning, while GM delayed its ambition of producing 400,000 EVs in North America in 2024—delaying the production of several models in the process.
But the dealers also bear some responsibility. There’s ample evidence that sales reps at car dealerships have blatantly lied about EVs, and coerced buyers to purchase gas cars. Some experts agree. They aren’t convinced that dealers are investing enough in educating their staff (and the customers) regarding EVs.
When I asked Loren McDonald, the CEO of EV consulting and marketing analysis agency EVAdoption, if dealers were simply bad at selling EVs, he said, “Yes and no. We’ve all heard the stories of clueless dealer sales reps when it comes to EVs.”
McDonald ran into a poorly informed sales rep at a Mercedes-Benz dealership a year ago. “He didn’t know if the EQB we were test driving had regenerative braking. He had to get a service technician to come out and try to figure it out—and he didn’t know how to turn it on. I finally figured it out myself,” McDonald told InsideEVs.
EVs, in a way, are a whole new language that needs learning, but dealers don’t seem to understand that. “Fundamentally, dealers and legacy automakers have yet to understand that they are selling a different product, one that is fueled by electricity and not gas,” McDonald said. “People are completely unfamiliar with the charging process, terminology, best practices, where to charge, how to charge, etc,” he added.
Over at the Sierra Club, a Washington D.C.-based environmental organization, a spokesperson used much harsher words to describe the dealers’ attempts to thwart the EPA’s efforts.
“Auto dealers are once again trying to block major progress on cleaner cars. For years, the Sierra Club has called out dealers (and automakers themselves) for failing to keep up with consumer demand for EVs,” Katherine Garcia, Sierra Club’s director of Clean Transportation For All told InsideEVs.
“The dealers have had years to prepare for the EV transition, but they’ve dragged their feet along the way,” Garcia added.
She thought this was unfair to Americans, especially those impacted by air pollution. “The dealers’ lobbying to weaken the EPA’s vehicle standards is an affront to American families. These important safeguards will protect families from car pollution, save drivers at the pump, and clean up climate emissions,” Garcia said. The negative impact of gas emissions on the environment has been broadly documented and proven.
McDonald suggested automakers might be behind dealers' woes due to some “strategic blunders,” like “bringing out BEV pickups for a segment that doesn’t see BEV pickups as meeting their needs of towing and range, versus large and mid-sized SUVs,” he said.
While electric pickups might not offer as much range, they still have a lot of demand—GM CEO Mary Barra recently said GM has 100,000 orders for its electric pickups, which includes the Silverado EV, Hummer EV, and Sierra EV. (The Tesla Cybertruck has over 1 million reservations, although selling them is not a dealer problem as Tesla sells directly to its customers.)
“The Chevy Bolt was the third-highest-selling EV in the U.S. in 2023. So clearly people are interested in EVs if the product is good, and fits their budget and driving needs and situation,” McDonald added. He also noted that more options were needed in the large and mid-size SUV segments, where volumes are generally high in the U.S.
“The Kia EV9 will likely do very well in 2024 and 2025. But where is the electric Ford Explorer? Where is the electric Chevy Tahoe?” he said.
Despite some of these “strategic blunders,” many automakers are all in on EVs—or at least they say. Regardless of how well they navigate the bumpy road ahead, they need dealers’ support to clear inventories, boost production, and keep the cycle going.
Whether dealers like it or not, the EV revolution is happening. Instead of writing letters that may go unread in the presidential inbox, dealers might find greater dividends in focusing on education—for both their staff and consumers. Investing in knowledge sooner rather than later could be a win-win for everyone involved.

"Some Automakers Soften On EVs, But Lucid Charges Forward",https://insideevs.com/news/707054/lucid-charges-forward-on-evs/,"CEO Peter Rawlinson thinks the future is bright for Lucid, citing behind-the-scenes groundwork that should pay off soon.",2024-02-01 14:40:53,"It’s almost as if 2024’s setting up to be a come-to-Jesus moment for EVs, as manufacturers ask what level of growth is truly sustainable for an electrified future. Overspending on development for returns that aren’t happening as fast as expected is leaving manufacturers with a dilemma: Do we press forward, or slow-roll existing plans? GM, Ford, and more are all scaling back their EV plans in the face of softer-than-expected (but growing) demand. Just recently, Elon Musk was candid with shareholders that he does not expect Tesla to be able to sustain the same level of growth it saw in 2023.
One company is adamant that it has the chutzpah to go the distance: Lucid. Last week, during a candid conversation with Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson at its Arizona factory, Rawlinson was very optimistic about Lucid’s position in the face of the rest of the industry. As other manufacturers soften and scale back, it’s full steam ahead at Lucid Motors, even after a year where the brand underdelivered.
Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson sees a bright future
Lucid Motors missed its manufacturing and sales targets for 2023, and its stock price faced similar headwinds. However, Lucid's CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson insists that a plant expansion, forthcoming new products, smarter communications strategy, and other behind-the-scenes investments are things that have set Lucid up for a stronger future.
“I think it’s a weird time, I think that macroeconomics and high-interest rates are really, really affecting luxury car sales,” said Rawlinson, admitting that Lucid’s missed targets disappoint everyone, including himself. But Rawlinson asks us to reframe Lucid’s numbers. In the US, the Lucid Air outsold cars like the BMW i7 (which was, admittedly, in its first year on sale) and is about one to two thousand units behind cars like the Mercedes-Benz EQS and Porsche Taycan. Although its 6,001 sales for 2023 were below its expectations, year-over-year, the Air has increased by 37%. Rawlinson notes that in the same time period, Tesla Model S sales declined. Likewise, he admitted that a simplified lineup and more competitive price structure for the 2024 model year may help the Air’s sales.
Rawlinson claims that its factory expansion and other long-term investments will pay off in 2024.
“There’s undue doom and gloom about electric cars; electric vehicles are the future. There are a lot of subpar EVs out there, and I believe that this is a tech race, and we’re in for the long haul,” said Rawlinson. Rawlinson says that there’s a lot of future-proofing and investment associated with sustainable mobility and electric cars that go beyond just Lucid’s financial statements. The Gravity and Midsize launches are also big opportunties for the brand, with Rawlinson suggesting they'll put the brand ahead of the pack.
Other OEMs are rethinking the EV revolution, perhaps waffling back toward ICE and hybrid options. Lucid, though, is built to make EVs, and it can now make a lot of them. The company's expanded factory can produce the Air and Gravity on the same line, which should help satisfy demand in new markets like China and Western Europe.
“Chinese market cars have to have their VINs stamped on the passenger floor, if the stamping isn’t explicitly clear, the cars will be rejected at import,” plant director Steven Inglis said as we toured the Arizona facility, highlighting just one of the challenges the plant faced as it geared up for foreign-market production.
Perhaps these are charitable reads on Lucid’s somewhat lackluster 2023, from leaders who view the company’s success as an imperative. From their hopeful comments, the sky is the limit for Lucid. However, some analysts remain more conservative in the face of market realities. “The Air and Gravity are very neat EVs, but they are priced out of reach for most new car shoppers, “ Ed Kim, president of auto market analysis firm AutoPacific, told InsideEVs via email.
Like Rawlinson, Kim doesn’t see the relative softening of still-growing EV demand as a death knell for electric cars entirely, as some anti-EV pundits suggest. Rather, it’s a symptom of badly planned product lineups, via an overemphasis on high-end luxury products, a problem that Lucid is a part of.
“The softening in the rate of adoption is a reflection of other factors, such as too many EV nameplates clustered at luxury price points (even for non-lux EV nameplates) and a resulting lack of affordable EV models that are needed to keep the rate of adoption going,” wrote Kim. “AutoPacific’s own data from the Future Attribute Demand Study (FADS) show that price is one of the top reasons that EV rejectors cite as a reason for not going electric. When those same people are asked what price point they’ll consider an EV, the data show that demand rises sharply below $35,000. As affordable and appealing new affordable EVs enter the market in the coming years, we expect the rate of EV adoption to soar,” he continued.
The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV’s roughly $30,000 price resonated so hard with consumers that they continued to set sales records despite GM announcing its death, prompting executives within the company to make a way for the car to return. The Tesla Model Y is the best-selling car in the world for a reason. It’s very close to the $35,000 price ceiling with the federal tax credit and can slip under it with state-level incentives. Granted, Lucid’s midsize car with a targeted starting price of $50,000 is above that $35,000 sweet spot, but it’s certainly a hell of a lot more affordable than the easily six-figure range of the Air sedan and forthcoming Gravity crossover. “If Lucid’s future midsize products incorporate most of what makes the Air and Gravity so desirable, Lucid has a great opportunity to grow and expand to the mainstream with strong appeal,” wrote Kim.
Lucid’s mainstream aspirations could seem strange considering its hyper-lux roots. This move downmarket could interpreted by some as a sales-starved brand pivoting to boost its flagging numbers, at the expense of brand image. The announcement certainly raised eyebrows.
Rawlinson sees it differently. In a relative sense, he says that Lucid has always had affordable products. True, the Air sedan’s not cheap, but when compared to its direct big sedan EV rivals, the Air solidly undercuts the EQE and EQS. “I think we need to do a better job in comms,” said Rawlinson. If it wants to succeed in selling cheaper models, Lucid has to make sure consumers know that it isn't sticking to the ultra-luxury space.
Will that be enough to get Lucid from slow trot to full sprint? The path seems treacherous, but the Lucid team’s ready to put up a fight.",Kevin Williams
Volvo Stops Funding Polestar As Geely Prepares Bailout,https://insideevs.com/news/707036/volvo-stops-funding-polestar-geely-new-significant-shareholder/,"The two companies will continue to collaborate on R&D, manufacturing, and sales.",2024-02-01 13:11:38,"Volvo Cars will discontinue funding all-electric performance brand Polestar, the Swedish carmaker said today in its 2023 financial statement. Describing this move as a “decisive transformation phase,” Volvo plans to reallocate funds from Polestar towards its own projects. The decision comes in the wake of a 43% increase in Volvo's profits in 2023, a record in its 97-year history, the company claims.
Both Volvo and Polestar are subsidiaries of China's Zhejiang Geely Holding group. Under the new agreement, Volvo intends to transfer a portion of its 48% stake in Polestar to parent company Geely, which will become a ""significant"" new shareholder in Polestar. Geely has promised to provide “full operational and financial support to Polestar” going forward.
The difference between Polestar and Volvo is rather confusing
Polestar was originally launched as a more performance-oriented, BEV-only, and exclusive sibling to Volvo. But with Volvo's own EV plans taking off successfully, and Polestar struggling, the line between the two brands has blurred.
It’s worth noting that Geely’s 79% stake in Volvo Cars remains unaffected by this development.
2023 was a record year for EV sales for most brands in the U.S., including Volvo. The automaker sold 113,419 BEVs in 2023 globally, a 70% increase compared to 2022. That figure includes the 35,000 plug-in cars (including PHEVs) it sold in the U.S., of which 13,609 were fully electric models. EVs represented 16% of its total global sales volume.
However, the story at Polestar has been somewhat different. It announced early this week that it was laying off 15% of its global workforce to reduce costs. It also struggled to meet its delivery targets in 2023. Despite the setbacks, it said that the rollouts of the Polestar 3 electric performance SUV and the Polestar 4 coupe were imminent.

“Volvo Cars’ and Polestar’s strong operational collaboration across R&D, manufacturing, after-sales, and commercial will continue to benefit both companies,” Jim Rowan, the president and CEO of Volvo Cars AB said. Volvo is bullish on its 2024 outlook as well, stating that it expects a higher year-over-year growth rate in its retail sales in 2024 compared to 2023.
Volvo's 2023 EV sales are based only on two models, the C40 Recharge and the XC40 Recharge. However, this year, Volvo is on track to expand its EV portfolio with the EX30, the smallest and the fastest Volvo ever, its bigger sibling the EX90, which is a full-sized electric SUV, and the EM90 MPV which Volvo cheekily describes as the ""Scandinavian living room on wheels.""",Suvrat Kothari
Here’s Why The Toyota bZ4x Is An Unexpected Hit In New York City,https://insideevs.com/news/706553/toyota-bz4x-new-york-rideshare/,A few factors have made Toyota's EV quite popular in the Big Apple.,2024-01-30 10:00:56,"If your mental image of New York City's streets is still dominated by the classic yellow Ford Crown Victoria taxis, it's time for an update. These days, the for-hire car of choice, whether they're the iconic yellow cabs or the commonly all-black vehicles for Uber and Lyft drivers, tends to be the hybrid Toyota RAV4s and Camrys. But could the all-electric Toyota bZ4x be the next contender for the NYC cab throne?
That may just be the case. Toyota's first modern battery EV is coming off its best sales year ever in 2023, doubling from the previous year in the third quarter alone. In addition to an improved sales performance, a few more factors coalesced to make it somewhat popular in New York City. Those include the recent rideshare regulations aimed at boosting EV adoption across the five boroughs and the fact that the bZ4x adorns a Toyota badge, one that has been associated with bulletproof reliability for decades.
The Toyota bZ4x gets a win in the for-hire car business
The Toyota bZ4x has been described as underwhelming on paper in terms of range and charging performance. But Toyota's reputation for quality and reliability is impossible to beat.
Over the past few weeks, InsideEVs has noticed a high number of bZ4xs rolling silently on NYC’s streets, and many of them wear the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) plates—meaning they’re ride-hail vehicles. I even spotted one patiently waiting amidst a sea of Teslas at a Brooklyn Supercharger that supports the CCS plug, but its owner wasn't interested in chatting.
In October 2023, the TLC passed its Green Rides Initiative, mandating all new for-hire vehicles to be electric. This led to a sudden surge in license applications, with TLC's daily intake skyrocketing from 150 to 2,000 applications overnight, a TLC spokesperson told InsideEVs. In a month, the agency received close to 10,000 applications—an unforeseen and overwhelming response.
A lot of those drivers went for Teslas. But several of them also seem to be choosing a brand they know and trust: Toyota.
By mid-November, the TLC had approved approximately 5,700 applications, with 88 percent belonging to individual drivers, according to a TLC spokesperson.
Coincidentally, Toyota ended 2023 on a high for its plug-in electric car sales. BZ4x sales soared by 188% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, and Toyota delivered 9,329 units during the whole year, up 663%. Toyota Motor North America confirmed to InsideEVs that within the U.S., New York State's share of bZ4x sales had increased from 8.8% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023—meaning a shade over 1,400 bZ4xs were sold in New York State last year.
“We have seen an uptick especially in the New York area, specifically in New York City, after the new regulation that encourages rideshare [drivers] to move towards EVs. It’s a good sign for us as a company,"" Joe Moses, the vice president of marketing at Toyota Motor North America told InsideEVs. ""We're starting to produce a few more and you could see when people do get a chance to experience it, they're picking it.""
It's safe to say that the Toyota bZ4x isn't the first thing that springs to mind when we think of truly great electric cars. It has some clear shortcomings: its fast-charging speed lags far behind Tesla and other rivals, it's built on a repurposed gasoline-car platform, and its electric range is a modest 252 miles in an age when 300 miles is a kind of mandatory minimum for family-focused crossovers.
Still, Toyota as a brand is the go-to for drivers looking for bulletproof daily use, and that increasingly includes the bZ4x for cab and Uber duty. Other New Yorkers have also noticed the trend. On one Reddit thread about the bZ4x, a user said, “All I hear online about this car is how bad it is, but I see them everywhere in NYC.” Another one said, “Its creature comforts are good value for the money, and if it fits your needs it is a reasonable choice.” Others agreed that it’s an adequate EV for the city from a brand that people have trusted for decades.
One user claimed to have driven to Alabama to buy one from a Tuscaloosa dealership that offered heavy discounts. “I now have a 10-year 95% [state of charge] guarantee with my bZ4x bought at 600 miles for $35,000,"" this person wrote. ""The insurance is cheap. And it is manufactured in Japan. The build quality is excellent, the car's performance is nothing new but it averages 200-240 miles.""
Toyota has added a bunch of additional features to the updated 2024 bZ4x, and they also include a year of complimentary charging at EVgo stations. The car's popularity is obvious when you get past some of the specs: in terms of shape, design, packaging, and experience, it is essentially an all-electric RAV4—one of the best-selling SUVs in North America.
In terms of comfort, build quality and features, InsideEVs found no real complaints with the bZ4x when we reviewed it two years ago. According to our sister publication Motor1.com, “the bZ has enough going for it to attract Toyota brand loyalists.”
Some estimates suggest that rideshare drivers cover between 100-300 miles per day, and it’s obvious that many of them drive gas-powered (and hybrid) Toyotas. If the bZ4x’s range was a little over 300 miles, it could potentially draw in Toyota loyalists seeking an upgrade from the RAV4.
“Bringing the right product that meets the needs of the mass consumers is how you get to RAV4 levels of volume. But being realistic, there are still a lot of questions under work around EVs, a lot of pieces in this puzzle that everybody's working aggressively on,” Toyota's Moses said. “Before we get to a point where we have something [electric that sells as much as] the RAV4, which is selling over 400,000 units a year, a lot of things need to be in place to be able to do that.""
That certainly includes more fast-charging support in cities like New York, which is becoming a problem as more and more taxi and ride-hail drivers go fully electric. Much of the emphasis on fast-charger growth has been along highways to support the great American road trip, but in New York—where it's monumentally tough to build anything—more infrastructure is needed in the five boroughs to support drivers whose cars are on the road all the time.
There's also the ongoing conflict between New York's established yellow cab system and the upstarts like Uber and Lyft. It’s hard to predict the bZ4x’s sales this year as the TLC is embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance which represents yellow cab, livery, and app-based drivers. The NYTWA has filed a lawsuit against the TLC, alleging that lifting the cap on for-hire EVs would harm the drivers who have not regained pre-pandemic levels of business. A Manhattan Supreme Court judge has temporarily blocked the TLC from issuing more for-hire licenses—which could impact all EV sales.
All said, Toyota is already working on batteries that would offer twice the range of a bZ4x. It has invested heavily in solid-state battery technology, and has a bunch of models in the pipeline that will ride on ground-up EV platforms; we saw some cool concepts at the Japan Mobility Show last year. The automaker is also unlikely to cede its hybrid crown to anyone soon, and it's likely the electrified RAV4 and Camry will continue to be the weapon of choice for most drivers for a while—in fact, the next Camry is going all-hybrid, which is good news for emissions in the city.
But if the bZ4x's unexpected success in NYC is any indication of consumers' willingness to embrace all-electric Toyotas under favorable policies, one can only imagine the reception an affordable, long-range, and reliable Toyota EV built on a dedicated platform would garner under the ideal circumstances.
Moses agreed that reliability would play a role in Toyota's future EVs. “It's something we're proud of as a company, having that type of reputation. I think many companies would kill to have that,” he said.

In Q4 of last year, Polestar sold about 12,800 EVs worldwide, a 39% decrease in volume compared to the same period in 2022.
""Polestar continues to protect its exclusive brand position in what remains a challenging market, resulting in fewer deliveries in the fourth quarter, and now expects a gross profit margin for the full year of around break-even,"" the marque said regarding its disappointing results.
That said, the company’s full-year sales numbers saw a slight increase of 6%, but it was not enough to reach the updated guidance of 60,000-70,000 sales in 2023, as the year ended with roughly 54,600 sales. Initially, Polestar hoped to sell 80,000 EVs last year.
Despite smaller numbers, the company’s head honcho remained optimistic about what’s to come. “[The] Polestar 4 has been very well received in China and ramping up production was an important milestone for us,” said Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO at the beginning of January. “Sales of our SUV coupé will start in Europe and Australia in the coming weeks. With the first deliveries of [the] Polestar 3 expected in the summer, our shift from being a one to three-car company positions us for a transformative and exciting 2024,” he added.",Iulian Dnistran
Porsche Thinks Europe's 2035 Combustion Engine Ban Might Be Delayed,https://www.motor1.com/news/706202/porsche-thinks-combustion-engine-ban-could-be-dealyed/,"Plus, Lincoln is eliminating 100 dealers in the United States in 2023 after cutting 100 last year.",2024-12-25 07:31:59,"Porsche CFO believes sales of new cars with combustion engines could continue in the European Union after 2035, and Lincoln is cutting 100 dealers in the United States this year.
This is AM Drive, Motor1's daily look at the news you need before you get in your car.
Porsche Thinks The Combustion Engine Could Survive Beyond 2035 in The EU
Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke attended the world premiere of the Macan EV this week in Singapore where he let it slip the combustion engine's future might not be as dark as claimed. Speaking with Automotive News Europe, the company's CFO said: ""There's a lot of discussions right now around the end of the combustion engine. I think it could be delayed.""
He was referring to the sales ban on new cars with combustion engines in the European Union from 2035. For the sake of clarity, the ban refers to cars that generate emissions, so in theory, hydrogen-burning combustion engines or ones that run on synthetic fuels could be allowed. In March 2023, Reuters reported on the European Commission's draft to allow sales of new ICE cars after 2035 provided the vehicles run on climate neutral fuels.
Later in September, the news agency followed-up with a story about another draft demanding automakers to demonstrate that their cars can run entirely on e-fuels that are carbon neutral.
In the case of Porsche, the Zuffenhausen-based marque projects more than 80 percent of cars delivered globally annually will be EVs by 2030. In the meantime, a gas model will be prematurely retired in the European Union where the first-generation Macan will cease to exist later this year due to upcoming cybersecurity regulations. The fully electric, second-generation model will indirectly take its place, but at a much higher price tag.
Lincoln Will Remove 100 Dealers In The US This Year
Ford's luxury brand will be streamlining its dealer network in the United States furthermore this year. After deleting 100 dealers last year, another 100 will be cut in 2024. That means Lincoln is going to have approximately 400 showrooms by the end of the year.
Most dealers are joined at the hip with a Ford store. Speaking with Automotive News, Lincoln President Dianne Craig said Lincoln retailers that agree with the buyout will receive in exchange additional Ford inventory. Another perk will be to offer incentive plans for returning customers.
In 2023, Buick, another American luxury brand, nearly halved its dealer footprint, concluding the year with approximately 1,000 showrooms. Parent company General Motors has compelled Buick dealerships to decide on whether to invest in EV tooling and training or accept a buyout. Buick ended 2023 with 47 percent fewer dealers compared to the beginning of the year.

"Nissan, Behind On EVs, Delays Two U.S.-Made EVs To 2026 And 2027: Report",https://insideevs.com/news/704637/nissan-delays-us-made-evs/,"The two EVs, a Nissan and an Infiniti, will be made in Canton, Mississippi—just later than expected.",2024-01-15 09:35:09,"Nissan has reportedly postponed the production start of two brand-new, U.S.-made electric vehicles that will be manufactured at the company’s Canton, Mississippi plant, according a supplier memo obtained by Automotive News.
The two EVs are reportedly meant to be a pair of sporty sedans based on an all-new platform, one badged as a Nissan and the other one bearing the Infiniti logo. Initially, production was scheduled to begin in 2025, but the date was pushed back by one year, according to a supplier production schedule that was unearthed by Automotive News last year. Those sedans could even bear some historic nameplates like Skyline and Maxima.
Nissan, an electric pioneer, struggles to keep up
Once ahead of the pack with the Leaf, Nissan is now playing catch-up to many competitors. Its EV crossover, the Ariya, has received mixed-to-positive reviews but has been dogged by production issues in Japan.
After the initial setback, newer supplier memos suggested the two new EVs were postponed another three months, and now, according to the latest information gathered by Automotive News, the production start of the two sedans is said to be delayed by two more months.
More Nissan EV Stories
In other words, the two all-new electric vehicles that were supposed to debut next year will reportedly see the light of day starting toward the end of 2026. The Nissan sedan, codenamed LZ1F, will go into production in November 2026, while the output of the Infiniti EV, codenamed LZ1E, will start in April 2027, as per Automotive News.
The reason for all these delays? One source told the publication that Nissan has concerns about the profitability and market demand for EVs. The Japanese automaker cited ""the need to enhance product competitiveness"" for its latest delay.
Sales of battery-powered vehicles crossed the 1.2 million mark last year, but multiple analysts and even automaker executives are saying that growth isn't happening as quickly as they once anticipated. Nissan may have been spooked by this outcome and decided to wait.
One point of contention is the increasing EV inventory in the country, which is an indicator of how fast (or slow) people are buying zero-emissions cars. According to Cox Automotive, EV inventory rose by 92% last year, with an average 113-day supply at the end of 2023. Compare that to the average days’ supply of 69 overall and the potential problems become clear.
That said, some manufacturers seem to go against the public’s wishes when it comes to churning out electric cars. While it’s commendable that Nissan wants to dive head-on into the sedan segment, a recent J.D. Power study found that EV adoption rates could be higher if more affordable compact SUVs were introduced.
Moreover, this reported decision is yet another setback for Nissan, which was once an early leader in the electric space with the Leaf. Infiniti's aging lineup has no EVs or hybrids, and the Nissan brand solely has the Ariya, which has faced a number of production challenges in Japan and does not qualify for U.S. tax credits. Betting on a much later date for wider EV adoption could put it more in line with future demand—or even further behind the curve.
Nevertheless, Nissan executives told us in Japan last year that they remain steadfast on an electric future, including plans to axe all non-EVs in Europe by 2030, more lower-cost EVs and the development of solid-state batteries.",Iulian Dnistran
Hertz Is Walking Back A Big Bet On EVs. Here's What's Really Going On,https://insideevs.com/news/704275/hertz-ice-tesla-2024/,Hertz is cutting a third of its EV rental car fleet and replacing it with gas-powered cars. But the real issue goes deeper than you think.,2024-01-11 17:28:58,"As the news of Hertz’s fire sale on previously rentable Teslas makes its way through the news cycle, the rental giant has also quietly announced that it’s pivoting more toward traditional gas-powered vehicles in the future. The company says that it is ""rebalancing"" the numbers in its fleets, which means selling off a third of its EV fleet and replacing those cars with ICE models.
According to Automotive News, Hertz said that it expects to sell off 20,000 cars in its EV stock, and that process already started as early as last month. The cash generated from the sales of its EV fleet will be pumped back into meeting demand for rental ICE vehicles. This comes on the heels of Hertz’s October announcement that it would be scaling back its EV operations, citing high repair costs and reduced residual value compared to the rest of its vehicles as reasons why its EV rental operations weren’t going so well.
The rental car industry is having a reckoning moment with EVs
Rental car customers have had a lot of frustrations with EVs last year, leading big players like Hertz to now focus on gas cars instead.
To some anti-EV pundits, Hertz is getting its just desserts. To them, Hertz has overinvested in a technology that isn’t proven, ready, or wanted by consumers. Now it has to pay the piper for overbuying a fleet of cars that no one wanted.
But is that what’s actually going on here?
True, the growth in demand for EVs has been a bit softer lately than many expected, but that information is likely immaterial to Hertz’s woes. Hertz has said that 80% of its EVs are Teslas, and although Hertz says that EVs come with higher repair costs, we can’t help but wonder: is this an EV thing, or is it a Tesla thing?
Hertz has claimed that damage and collision costs are high for its EV rentals. Given Tesla’s higher-than-average insurance costs and notoriously long and expensive repair times, it almost feels as if the concept of EV running and repair costs have been conflated as being an EV thing, rather than a more specific Tesla-adjacent problem. (Hertz has not responded to a request for comment from InsideEVs.)
Moreover, not long after it started purchasing Teslas, price cuts as well as the reintroduction of the $7,500 new EV tax credit meant the Model 3 and Model Y became dramatically cheaper. Sometimes literally overnight. Those cars settled down in the mid-$30,000 range and low $40,000 range, respectively. That may be good for consumers in search of a deal, but it had the effect of hurting resale value. Hertz had effectively overpaid for vehicles that it would not be able to get anywhere near as much of a return on when it was time for them to be sold, and resales are a huge source of revenue for rental companies.
Other automakers may have cut prices, but none as dramatically and carte blanche as Tesla. These problems aren’t just affecting rental companies, as Tesla owners have openly and loudly alleged that reduced residual values due to price cuts have abnormally hurt their resale value.
But again, that's more of a Tesla problem, rather than an EV problem. The rental car company Sixt seems to recognize this, it still plans to electrify 90% of its rental fleet, but it’s pivoting away from Tesla for similar reasons as Hertz.
(It's worth noting that while the bulk of Hertz's EV fleet is—or was—comprised of Teslas, it also purchased a substantial amount of Polestar 2s as well. It's unclear whether those cars suffered with the same repair cost issues, although we do know they tended to have low resale values as well.)
Finally, it's worth noting that Hertz and other rental car companies haven't exactly nailed the experience and education part of the EV piece. It’s not hard to find a consumer who rented an EV from Hertz and encountered bad customer service, got surprised with an EV and no explanation as to how it works, or received any instruction on how and where to charge.
Heck, I rented a Kia EV6 from Hertz last April in Phoenix. The experience was more than slightly frustrating; I was given a car with a 50% state of charge despite the reservation asserting that the car would be at or close to 100%. I needed to go to Tuscon, about two hours away, and I hadn’t planned or researched online where I could DC fast charge near PHX airport. It’s not fun trying to find an accessible DC fast charger in an unfamiliar city when you’re on a time crunch.
I’m paid to understand these things so perhaps I am naturally more prone to suffering than a normal driver. However, I couldn’t help that this experience could make the average renter hate EVs.
Still, a reduction in the EV fleet doesn’t mean that Hertz is eliminating its fleet entirely. Hopefully, Hertz has learned a lesson here, and a smaller, more streamlined EV renting experience prevails.
On the flip side, the purge of 20,000 EVs from Hertz’s fleets means that used EV deals might be the name of 2024. Those $20,000 three-year-old Teslas might be the rule, not the exception.

"More Than 7,000 U.S. Car Dealers Sign Up For 'Point Of Sale' EV Credits",https://insideevs.com/news/702160/7000-dealers-register-point-of-sale-ev-credits/,Thousands of car dealers are about to make it easier—and cheaper—to buy an EV in 2024. Here's how.,2023-12-24 16:00:57,"Automotive dealers and electric vehicles, it’s not quite the match made in heaven. If 2023 was anything to go by, the schism was glaring—a year marked by staunch dealer rebellion against EVs. The resistance came in several ways, one of which was a letter signed by almost 4,000 dealerships to President Biden demanding to “slow down” the regulations favoring EV manufacturing and sales. Another one involved blatant lies to customers about the capabilities of EVs to coerce them into buying gas cars instead.
But 2024 could open a new chapter for American dealers, and allow them an opportunity to come clean. Fresh news out of Washington D.C. indicates that dealers might be willing to embrace EVs (or at least make a genuine attempt.) More than 7,000 American car dealers have registered with the IRS to provide tax credits to customers at the point of sale, the U.S. Department of Treasury said on Friday.
This means that EV buyers will get a discount of up to $7,500 right when they purchase the car at the dealership, without having to wait until tax season to file for a rebate.
U.S. car dealers signal support for updated tax credit provisions.
American car dealers were unwilling to sell EVs. But new IRS guidance, effective January 1, 2024, allows buyers to redeem tax credits right when they buy an EV. Thousands of dealers, surprisingly, support this provision.
The number of dealers who registered to offer point-of-sale credits to customers could be higher than 7,000, as per the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). “There are many more dealerships that are covered by those 7,000 registrations, and this does not include the many registration applications submitted but the IRS has not yet approved,” a NADA spokesperson told Automotive News. NADA's 2023 data showed 17,000 franchised dealerships in the U.S.
So far, buyers had to wait until after filing their tax return to claim the federal clean vehicle credit. This meant they would receive the credit several months after purchase. New guidance under the Inflation Reduction Act expedites this process. From January 1, 2024, buyers can drive home an EV by paying a reduced amount upfront, eliminating the need to wait to get their money back. (That’s theoretical, and we need to wait and see how it pans out in the real world.)
The year-long skullduggery, and downplaying of the vitality of EVs, was rooted in some genuine concerns. Investing in charging infrastructure and educating sales personnel requires significant financial commitment. Not to mention the lower sales commissions and after-sales profits. As EVs have fewer moving parts, they require less maintenance. No oil changes, and no need to replace spark plugs or fuel injectors. Despite these valid concerns, the signs are clear: Scientific consensus on the effects of global warming calls for an incontrovertible EV adoption, which many American dealers vehemently opposed.
The claim that “enthusiasm [for EVs] has stalled” was a highlight in the letter to Biden. But the new IRS guidance could be a morale booster for dealers. They now have a foolproof reason to attract customers. It could help them clear their piling EV inventories, make space for new batches, and in turn, spur manufacturing, which has taken a backseat for some carmakers. It’s a red carpet to take EVs seriously, end the cattiness, and give EPA’s emissions targets due consideration.
More U.S. Dealers News:
For now, any positive outcome is a speculation, of course. And one sweeping red wave in next year’s election could thwart years of progress. But if the formula works, all the fossil fuel-championing Republican nominees (and their eventual presidential candidate) will have one of the biggest reasons to hurl vitriol toward EVs snatched out of their books.",Suvrat Kothari
"These GM, Ford And Tesla EVs Will Lose Their Tax Credit On January 1, 2024",https://insideevs.com/news/702104/gm-ford-tesla-credit-2024/,"The effects may be temporary, but for now, they mean changes to the Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Mustang Mach-E and more.",2023-12-22 10:47:27,"Now that the rules around the changing electric vehicle tax credits have been finalized, we know more about what cars will and won't qualify for them come Jan. 1, 2024. For now, at least, quite a few models from General Motors, Ford and even Tesla will lose their credits.
GM said yesterday it expects the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV to lose eligibility for the U.S. EV tax credit starting next year, albeit only ""temporarily,"" according to a Detroit News report.
The tax credits are changing again in January
The tax credit system—which in January 2023 applied to almost every EV on sale—is now being slimmed down to prioritize cars whose battery materials aren't made in what the U.S. government calls a ""foreign entity of concern,"" specifically China. And due to China's power over the EV supply chain, that impacts quite a few cars. But automakers are quickly working to rectify that problem.
""After reviewing Treasury's long-awaited proposed guidance, we believe the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EV will temporarily lose eligibility for the clean vehicle credit on Jan. 1, 2024 because of two minor components,"" GM spokesperson Liz Winter said in a statement to InsideEVs. The components in question are separators and electrolytes, according to the Detroit News story.
""While we await final rules, GM has pulled ahead sourcing plans for qualifying components in early 2024 and will advocate for our dealers and customers who purchase vehicles built ahead of the new guidance,"" Winter added. GM said it expects both electric SUVs to qualify for the credit again in early 2024, without providing a timeline.
The company added that the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Optiq produced ""after the sourcing change will be eligible for the full incentive."" Mind you, the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will remain eligible for the credit come January 1, 2024.
Interestingly, GM said it is committed to ""providing the equivalent EV tax credit purchase amount for any vehicles that became ineligible due to the new guidelines"" beginning in January, according to a letter to dealers signed by John Roth, vice president of Cadillac, and Scott Bell, vice president of Chevrolet, and seen by the Detroit News.
In other words, at least for now, it sounds like GM is going to give a similar discount to EVs until it sorts out the battery issues. We'll provide information on that as we get it.
Ford is also losing eligibility for some key EVs. The automaker announced that the E-Transit electric van and Mustang Mach-E will lose the $3,750 tax credit in 2024, while the Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring plug-in hybrid will also lose the $7,500 incentive.
The F-150 Lightning will remain eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, while the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrids will retain a $3,750 incentive.
As for Stellantis, it doesn't expect any changes for its plug-in hybrids. The Chrysler Pacifica minivan should continue to qualify for a $7,500 credit, while the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe SUVs should retain a $3,750 incentive.
Meanwhile, even Tesla is impacted by these changes. We know that the RWD and Long Range variants of the Tesla Model 3 will lose the $7,500 incentive in January, due to Chinese-sourced batteries. Tesla has said similar reductions may happen to the Model Y as well.
There are some upsides to the tax credit next year. Eligible consumers will get an immediate credit at the point of sale, without having to claim it on their taxes; it will work like a discount, basically. However, the big downside to that is that the list of eligible EVs in 2024 is a lot shorter, due to new rules on battery components and minerals.

E-Scooter Sharing Platform Bird Has Filed For Bankruptcy In The US,https://insideevs.com/news/702006/bird-escooter-bankruptcy-usa/,Bird’s Canadian and European operations will continue for the time being.,2023-12-22 09:39:23,"Electric scooters have been through quite a roller coaster ride in recent years. From being the darlings of the e-mobility space to pretty much becoming outcasts in many parts of the world, the electric scooter story can be considered tragic for some, with e-scooter sharing company Bird being the latest casualty of changing micromobility preferences.
Back when Bird went public in 2021, its stock was valued at more than $2 billion at the New York Stock Exchange. However, a year later in 2022, its stock price went into free fall and landed at a meager $70 million. The company was founded by Travis VanderZanden back in 2017. A former executive at Lyft and Uber, he saw a lot of potential in the e-scooter sharing industry. Eventually, Bird expanded and presently operates in 350 cities all over the world.
Despite its expansion, it seems the tides aren't in Bird’s favor. The company just recently filed for bankruptcy in the US, and stated that it has entered a “financial restructuring process” aimed to better position the company for long-term growth. This new restructuring process in applicable to Bird’s US operations, and makes it clear that the company’s Canadian and European operations will continue as before. For reference, a court filing states the Bird’s assets and liabilities are valued between $100 million to $500 million, and have initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for financial restructuring.
Michael Washinushi will retain his position as CEO of Bird for the time being, and is hopeful that the restructuring program will be able to turn Bird’s fortunes around. In the company’s official press release, he stated, “We are making progress toward profitability and aim to accelerate that progress by right-sizing our capital structure through this restructuring. We remain focused on our mission to make cities more livable by using micromobility to reduce car usage, traffic, and carbon emissions.""
More E-Mobility News:
While Bird’s operations in Canada and Europe remain undisturbed for now, many European countries haven’t been taking too kindly on the use of e-scooters for personal mobility. E-scooter sharing has been in quite a pinch in recent years, with dense European cities like Paris implementing an outright ban on e-scooter sharing, instead focusing on other e-mobility solutions such as electric bicycles.

US E-Bike Sales Have Quadrupled Since 2019 – What Could The Future Hold?,https://insideevs.com/news/701796/us-ebike-sales-400-percent-increase-4-years/,E-Bikes could hold the key to the future of urban mobility.,2023-12-21 09:29:44,"I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again: electric bicycles are rapidly reshaping the way people get around all over the world. This trend is most evident in Asia and Europe, as more and more people choose to leave their cars in their garages most of the week, and instead commute around town aboard their e-bikes. Indeed, I rode to the cafe in which I’m writing this article as we speak, and I only ever take my car out on longer trips or when I take my family with me.
While electric bicycle adoption is indeed most widespread in Europe and Asia, the growth of the segment can’t be ignored in the US market, even if for now, it mostly encompasses recreational vehicles and for-sport applications. A report by Business Insider which was echoed by the Office Of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy highlights the growth of the segment in the US market. According to the report, there were 325,000 e-bikes sold in the US in 2018. 2019 saw this drop to 287,000 units, however, when the global pandemic hit, it proved to be a massive boom for the e-bike industry.
Fast forward to 2022, and there were 1.1 million electric bicycles sold in the US, marking an almost 400-percent increase as those sold in 2019. If we look at this from a monetary perspective, 2019 raked in about $240 million in e-bike sales, while 2022 returned a whopping $885.5 million. Yes, the e-bike industry is fast approaching the one billion-dollar mark. In fact, we previously reported that the global e-bike industry could soon amount to $120 billion by 2030. Given the rapid growth of the segment, not just in the US, but the rest of the world, the industry could hit this milestone sooner than expected.
It’s also worth noting however, that while electric bicycle sales have skyrocketed in recent years, this wasn’t without its tradeoff. The non-electric bike market took a hit, with sales slumping by 16 percent in 2022. This is a clear indication that some cyclists are ditching leg-powered machines in favor of electrically assisted ones, and quite frankly, it’s easy to understand why this is the case. As it would turn out, slapping an electric motor onto a bike opens up all sorts of possibilities when it comes to its configuration, and so we’re seeing all sorts of cargo bikes, powerful off-road bikes, and even family e-bikes hit the market.
So, what does the future hold for e-bike adoption in the US? Well, there are currently some pretty attractive incentives for folks who buy an electric car, but the same incentives are hardly present for those looking to commute by bike. This could all be about to change, as the same report by Business Insider highlights that a group of congresspeople reintroduced the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act earlier in 2023.
Under the proposal, consumers could enjoy up to a 30-percent discount (up to $1,500 USD) on the purchase of a new e-bike. The law aims not only to make e-bikes more accessible, but also to encourage local governments to invest in bike-friendly infrastructure.

DHL Thinks Its Electric Trucks Are Just Right For The Country,https://insideevs.com/news/700734/dhl-electric-ohio-shipping-volvo/,These trucks use up to 50% less energy than a traditional Diesel truck on the same route.,2023-12-14 15:43:41,"When it comes to electrified issues, Ohio sometimes gets left behind. Whether that’s certain vehicles, state-level tax incentives or even a charging network as expansive as that of other states, we all collectively get skipped. It’s cool. We’re used to it. After all, California’s the biggest market for anything electrified. But that doesn’t mean Ohio—and other states that aren't California—are not somehow pivotal to understanding how and where we can get away from gas.
Many companies get this. Take DHL, the massive international logistics and shipping company with a regional headquarters in Westerville, Ohio. Shipping accounts for a lot of emissions. So as DHL attempts to electrify its fleets to address that problem, it's open about how states like Ohio can help it understand what the actual use cases are for EVs in the rest of the country. DHL invited me to Westerville to take a gander at an example of one of its new completely electric trucks—and hear about its plans to electrify shipping.
The trucking industry faces an emissions transformation too
From the Tesla Semi to experiments in hydrogen power, the trucking industry must also evolve to meet a future where emissions rules are much stricter. This story describes just one part of that effort.
DHL doesn’t do door-to-door parcels anymore here in the United States. No, it lost that battle in the late 2000s to UPS and FedEx. But DHL still does international deliveries, where it then turns over its packages to USPS, UPS, or FedEx letting them finish out those last packages. It also does contract shipping, where it manages curated clients shipping large items from one space to another. These new Class 8 tractor-trailers are meant to serve as last-mile delivery solutions for the clients it has.
The one on display in Ohio is one of the 17 trucks—including five compressed natural gas ones—it plans to have in service by the end of spring 2024.
I’ll admit, that might not sound like a lot of trucks, but DHL’s fleet isn’t super big. DHL’s President of Transportation, Jim Monkmeyer explained that it’s only about 1,500 trucks or so it has in its nationwide fleet, which currently do the same purpose as the EV trucks it has here. (And DHL already has 30,000 light-to-heavy duty EVs deployed all over the world.)
Keep in mind, these EV trucks aren’t meant to be long-haul, cross-country type operations, but more so last-mile deliveries meant for cities and other shorter runs. So in proportion, that’s not too bad. These trucks have tangible benefits, too. DHL found an EV truck consumed about 50% less energy than a diesel one when put on the same job. Switching to electric makes a lot of sense.
The truck itself on display at DHL’s Westerville campus was a fairly standard Volvo VNR class 8 truck, shown off in the smaller four-module battery pack. DHL’s Senior Director of Asset Management, Ted Valin, said that the company expects to get about 150 miles of range from this truck, and closer to 225 miles of range; enough to handle the local routes that DHL has in mind for the truck. DHL added that it has two Freightliner eCascadias entering service, which also have about the same range and performance as the battery-powered Volvo VNR. The company says the electric trucks get up to 250 miles on a single charge, which works well for regional hauling.
“One of the unique things we’re doing is testing them outside of the state of California,” Valin said. This testing allows the company to learn just what these trucks will do when faced with concerns like cold weather or snow, things that aren’t as much of an issue in the Golden State.
With those limitations in mind, DHL can effectively tweak its routes to ensure the truck will always have enough range to finish the job. “We’re gonna have [the trucks] in Columbus, Charlotte, Philadelphia, and even Middletown, Ohio,” Valin added.
Of course, ensuring those routes fall within their scope is key. Right now, DHL isn’t all that keen on investing in or relying on public charging infrastructure. The Volvo VNR uses the same CCS 1 combo port just like any other EV on the market. But for now, all of the charging for these vehicles will be done at the vehicle’s home base. DHL says that as the largest contract shipper in the US, its advantages are that it can effectively manage its charging needs, from dispatch. So right now, the company doesn’t really need public charging at all.
But plenty of trucking companies that do more long-haul freight work are getting into the charging game; this summer the Wall Street Journal reported Daimler Truck is working with renewable company NextEra Energy on a network designed to support the trucking industry. Right now, we're even seeing automakers not traditionally involved in ""fueling"" get into the charging game. It seems likely trucking companies will need to do something similar, too.
Perhaps most famously, PepsiCo has a small fleet of Tesla Semi trucks posting encouraging range results, and one large Coca-Cola distributor is also using Daimler Freightliner eCascadias too. These efforts are still in the early phases, but they may show eventual promise.
My conversation with Valin ended on a high note. He called himself a “true believer” in electrification, speaking on how much he loves his Tesla. The low maintenance allure of his EV is part of the reason he believes that these new EV Class 8 trucks will work out to be superior to the traditional ICE trucks.
For the handful already in DHL’s fleet, Monkmeyer and Valin both claimed that drivers appreciated how quiet, comfortable and quick these trucks were, allowing drivers to end shifts with less fatigue. In theory, the benefits of the truck itself could lead to DHL attracting and retaining drivers in a world where truck drivers are in short supply.
DHL plans to electrify 30% of its fleet by 2030. Could electric trucks make shipping cheaper and greener? It certainly beats the alternative.

Volkswagen Looking To Renault For Help Developing Cheap EV: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/700216/volkswagen-possible-tie-up-renault-cheap-ev/,"VW is falling behind its European competitors, so it’s looking for partnerships to help it regain lost ground.",2023-12-11 11:30:16,"A potential tie-up between Volkswagen and Renault that might result in a cheap electric car for the masses is in the works. And it can’t come soon enough, seeing how the German automaker has been in the spotlight recently for its EV-related woes, while Renault seems to be on a roll.
According to the German newspaper Handesblatt cited by Automotive News Europe, VW wants to cooperate on a platform that will underpin its upcoming $21,500 (€20,000), and so it started discussions with Renault. The source, citing people familiar with the matter, notes that the talks are still “at a very early stage” and that they could lead to nothing.
As luck would have it, Renault recently revealed its next-generation Twingo EV concept that’s slated to become a series-production car in 2026 boasting an impressive energy consumption of 160.9 watt-hours per mile. That’s 50% more efficient than current small EVs.
At the same time, Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said last month that the namesake automaker is working on a sub-$21,500 EV that could become a reality by the second half of the decade. Mind you, this is not the EV that will be inspired by the ID. 2all concept revealed in the spring–that one will be a bit bigger and will reportedly cost under $27,000 (€25,000).
So at first glance, it might seem that if the stars align just right, we could see a Volkswagen and Renault tie-up that will fight the incoming wave of cheap-ish battery-powered cars from China. At least in Europe, that is.
More Affordable EVs
On the Old Continent, Stellantis–which owns more brands than I have fingers, including Peugeot and Citroen–seems to be doing better than VW in the EV game. The Citroen e-C3 was recently launched with a starting price tag of about $24,500 and more affordable models are set to be shipped from China thanks to a partnership between Stellantis and Leapmotor.
This wouldn’t be the first time Renault collaborated with a rival automaker to develop an EV. Back in 2020, the French carmaker debuted the current-gen Twingo ZE which is more or less the same car as the discontinued Smart EQ ForFour sold by Daimler.

Volkswagen Will Cut Staffing Costs By A Fifth As Part Of Group's $10.8B Savings Plan (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/699903/vw-to-cut-staffing-costs-fifth/,VW brand CEO Thomas Schaefer said last week that the carmaker is “no longer competitive.”,2023-12-11 10:24:54,"Correction: An earlier version of this story conflated VW Group employees with VW brand employees; only the latter faces these staff cuts. We regret the error.
Volkswagen’s woes are taking turns for a place under the spotlight. After pausing production at some of its electric vehicle factories in Europe citing weak demand and the brand’s CEO saying that it was “no longer competitive,” the people’s car manufacturer has released more details about the parent group's $10.8 billion savings plan that should put it back on track.
According to Automotive News Europe, citing an internal memo, the VW brand plans to cut administrative staff costs by a fifth. Last year, the German car group that bears the same name had 675,000 employees worldwide.
Volkswagen said it will not resort to layoffs. Instead, the staffing cuts will happen by way of partial and early retirement, the internal memo mentioned.
Besides the restructuring, VW will reduce the product cycles from 50 months or a little over four years to just three years. This means we should see facelifted and new-generation models one year earlier during their lifetime. Furthermore, a planned $862 million (€800 million) research and development site in Wolfsburg, Germany will no longer be built.

In the previous decade, Volkswagen produced about 780,000 cars on average per year at its plant in Wolfsburg. By comparison, this year the company hopes to achieve 500,000 units, which is far below its previous achievements. ""At the end of November, after 11 out of 12 months, we have produced 453,000 vehicles,"" works council head Daniela Cavallo said for Automotive News Europe.
""We will need to operate with fewer people in many areas at Volkswagen in the future,"" brand boss Thomas Schaefer told employees at a meeting in Wolfsburg on Wednesday. ""This doesn't mean more work for fewer people, but rather shedding old habits and saying no to duplicating efforts and inefficiencies,” he added.",Iulian Dnistran
"The Tesla Cybertruck Has Strong Sales Potential, But Only If US Buyers Step Up",https://insideevs.com/news/700013/tesla-cybertruck-sales-potential/,Tesla has done very well globally. But Cybertruck is aimed at the US market where electric trucks aren't popular.,2023-12-09 13:31:48,"Much has been written about the Tesla Cybertruck since it was first unveiled as a prototype in December 2019. Last week was the launch of the production version and, as expected, media coverage has skyrocketed.
This truck is an evolution of the pickup in many ways. Its bold design, numerous features, interesting solutions, and positioning in the market make it one of this year's most important revelations. But what is its real impact on Tesla's sales volume and global markets?
The Cybertruck is arguably Tesla's most capable vehicle, combining true hypercar acceleration (0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds) with pickup practicality and room for five in the cabin. Thanks to the capabilities of its batteries and software, Tesla has managed to shake up not only major electric vehicle markets, but also the industry in general. The Cybertruck is the confirmation of this trend.
With an entry price of $61,000, the Cybertruck isn't exactly cheap. The price is a far cry from the $40,000 Musk promised four years ago and is the result of inflation and real-world production challenges. However, this is a competitive base price for a vehicle with these features. The volume-weighted average retail price of electric pickup trucks sold in the US between January and September 2023 was $82,835.
On the other hand, the cheapest rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck won't be available until 2025, and it costs $11,000 more than the least expensive Ford F-150 Lightning. The Chevrolet Silverado EV will also have a price tag of several thousand dollars less, so Tesla won't have the luxury of simply undercutting Detroit brands in a price war.
Things are different at the other end of the pricing scale. The most expensive Cybertruck, officially called the Cyberbeast, has 845 horsepower and can travel up to 320 miles on a single charge. Its price is $99,990, which in this case, works out to be more affordable than its closest rival, the GMC Hummer EV Pickup. While that truck has 1,000 hp, it's also heavier by over 2,000 pounds and is slower than Cybertruck. The maximum range is a bit better at 381 miles, but the flagship GMC Hummer EV 3X trim starts at $106,945. Rivian is competitive price-wise, but still a bit slower than the Cyberbeast.
As such, the latest Tesla seems competitive compared to its rivals in the United States. Given its performance, capabilities, and price, it could do very well in the US market where pickup trucks rule the roads. Of course, this depends on buyers stepping away from traditional combustion engines to adopt electric power.
Americans are buying EVs. Between January and October 2023, a total of 959,000 new light-duty electric vehicles were sold in the United States. While this is a solid 60 percent increase over the same period in 2022, these vehicles only accounted for 7.4 percent of the total market. Meanwhile, battery electric vehicles were 15 percent of the European total and around 20 percent in China.
The electric pickup segment is still fairly unpopular in the States. Their sales represented less than 3 percent of total EVs through October. The F-150 Lightning sold just 16,200 units in its first 10 months, according to JATO Dynamics. While electric vehicles accounted for nearly 9 percent of total SUV sales, electric pickup trucks accounted for 1.2 percent of the segment's total.
For Cybertruck to succeed, it must win in North America. Tesla has created the world's best-selling car in the Model Y thanks to strong sales around the globe, but the Cybertruck doesn't have that same global potential. Big pickups are only popular in the United States and Canada.
Will the Cybertruck bring attention to electric trucks? I'm sure, yes. However, America's pickup culture is only as strong as its connection to gasoline. Changing this situation will require a different approach. Consumers in the truck market likely won't take to electric power as easily as those in other segments, such as SUVs.

China Pushes Back On Biden's New EV Tax Credit Rules,https://insideevs.com/news/699883/china-biden-ira-rules/,China thinks the new rules run counter to the spirit of the World Trade Organization.,2023-12-08 10:17:45,"Not everyone’s a fan of the Biden Administration’s new rules for the Inflation Reduction Act. The latest entity to push back on the new rules is China. The IRA’s revisions add new, stricter regulations on battery materials, making things a lot harder for EV manufacturers, and causing China to call foul play.
Basically, the Biden Administration’s revisions remove eligibility for vehicle tax credits if more than trace amounts of battery materials come from countries deemed a ""Foreign Entity of Concern,” or FEOC for short. That could mean North Korea, Russia, Iran, and now China – a big deal. In 2024, completed batteries that are made with components made by FEOCs make a vehicle ineligible, and by 2025 EVs that have battery minerals that go beyond trace amounts that come from FEOCs, also will not qualify. It’s why some variants of the Tesla Model 3 won’t be eligible for the full tax credit next year, and the Mustang Mach-E is now completely ineligible in 2024.
More EV News
According to a report from Reuters, China has pushed back, asserting that this policy runs counter to WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. China says this policy is exclusionary and is a “ typical non-market orientated policy.” China also asserts that other WTO members have expressed concern about the policy, also agreeing that it violates the basic principles of the WTO. China thinks these policies could seriously impede and disrupt international trade and investment.
Is China right? It’s not quite clear yet, nor is it arguably all that important to the goal of getting drivers away from gas, and into EVs. Right now, this new policy could have a cooling effect on the EV market. Many EV battery packs for sale in cars on lots today, have significant Chinese content, and it’s not exactly possible to change those vehicles to an approved source overnight. Likewise, the potential for Biden to institute a 25% ownership cap on FEOC investment in companies could make plans, like Ford’s planned CATL joint venture battery plant, significantly more complicated. That plant in theory should make things easier for Ford to assemble battery packs stateside and thus make its EVs requalify for subsidies, but if the CATL plant is hurt by Biden’s new rules, then it’s all pretty much for naught.",Kevin Williams
"'Great For The Industry': Ford, Others Get Tesla Cybertruck 48V System Specs",https://insideevs.com/news/699798/tesla-shares-cybertruck-48v-architecture/,This might spark another technological shift in the industry.,2023-12-07 13:24:20,"The Tesla Cybertruck is equipped with an all-new 48-volt low-voltage system, which replaces the outdated but still the popular, 12-volt system.
This move from 12- to 48 volts for auxiliary onboard devices was confirmed by Tesla during the 2023 Investor Day in March and applied in the final product as promised.
*The main traction battery system that runs the drive units is a high-voltage one with a nominal voltage of over 800 volts.
The main benefit of higher voltage for auxiliary devices is that the same power can be supplied at a lower current, which directly lowers the current losses and allows the use of thinner wires to save weight and cost. Large vehicles already were using 24-volt systems, but 48-volt is still a rare solution in cars.
Tesla does not intend to stop there by simply moving from 12 volts to 48 volts for its own electric vehicles. The automaker would like to help spread the 48-volt architecture through the industry.
This is why Tesla sent the 48-volt system specs to other manufacturers and Ford CEO Jim Farley just confirmed that he received it.
Considering his response ""Great for the industry!"" we can assume that Ford will be willing to implement a 48-volt system in its vehicles as well, potentially starting with some next-generation all-electric vehicles.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk also responded, ""You're welcome."" Perhaps we'll soon see some other manufacturers hint at 48 volts now.
Update: In a following post, Jim Farley said: ""Great to read the document and realize that our next-gen team has been on a similar path. Let’s work together to help the supply base move into the 48V future as well."" This clearly indicates that the next-generation Ford all-electric vehicles will also have a 48-volt system.
Despite many obvious benefits, the automotive industry is sometimes very slow to change the things that work for something better.
The switch from 12 volts to 48 volts is not as simple as one would think, because it requires redesigning vehicle wiring and (at least in most cases) all new electric components (every motor, light, sensor, and chip) or at least ensuring that they can operate at a higher voltage.
The issues are that this requires investment, there are not that many suppliers of parts and there is no economy of scale at the beginning. The changes also mean that all of the service centers need to be ready for the new low-voltage system.
With Tesla's template of a 48-volt low-voltage system, the rest of the industry might be willing to develop their own solution—first, because it will be easier to start from something rather than from scratch, and secondly, because now the competition is one step ahead.
Following the first Tesla Cybertruck deliveries, Munro Live's Sandy Munro had an opportunity to speak with Elon Musk about the 48-volt system and issues that prevented such a move in the past.
Let's also recall that in new electric cars, Tesla still uses a 12-volt low-voltage system, but already managed to switch from the typical lead-acid auxiliary batteries to 12-volt lithium-ion auxiliary batteries. The switch was announced in February 2021, and initially launched in the refreshed Tesla Model S/Model X (starting with the Plaid) - see an in-depth teardown here - and later used also in the Model 3/Model Y (in late 2021).
We haven't seen the Tesla Cybertruck's auxiliary battery yet, and an online manual has not yet been released but we assume that the new 48-volt battery in the Tesla Cybertruck is also a lithium-ion battery. The question is what type of battery cells (and from whom) were used?

Rental Company Sixt Phases Out Tesla EVs From Fleet,https://insideevs.com/news/699689/tesla-sixt-ev-fleet/,"The German rental car giant says the reduced residual value, and high repair costs as the reasons why it's dropping Teslas.",2023-12-06 18:08:31,"The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y’s price cuts sure have been a boon to regular consumers. In many places, all across the world, the Model 3 and Model Y top the EV sales charts because it’s such a good deal. It offers aspirational luxury at a price that’s only a little bit more than mainstream brands. But, not everyone’s happy with Tesla’s price cuts. According to a report from Bloomberg, German-based rental car company Sixt has announced that it’s phasing out Tesla electric rental cars from its fleets because of reduced resale costs.
Sixt isn’t the first rental car company to push back on EVs. A few months ago, Hertz announced that its EV rentals were a money loser, with many of the benefits extolled by EV advocates never materializing. The cars broke down more often than expected and were more expensive to repair than the comparable ICE car. To add insult to injury, Hertz bought much of its fleet at the height of Tesla’s price wars – Tesla severely cut its pricing not long after it ordered hundreds of cars. The resultant price cuts and surge in sales have hurt resale value, Hertz said that residuals of EVs as a whole have dropped by about a third. For a rental company that will periodically replace its fleet, that’s not great news.
More EV Rental Info
Sixt has a similar reasoning. High repair costs and lower residuals due to the reduced pricing have the brand thinking twice. However, whereas Hertz focused on slowing its investment in EVs as a whole, Sixt is specifically targeting Tesla vehicles. Sixt says that it still plans to electrify 90% of its fleet by the end of the decade, but at least for the foreseeable future, it probably won’t include new Tesla vehicles.
Is this a sign of trouble in the EV world? Maybe. Tesla’s elevated repair costs and reduced residuals are likely mostly a Tesla problem, but there have been data that shows that EVs in general cost more to repair. A Consumer Reports survey recently showed that proportionally, EV drivers have complained about reliability woes more than ICE cars. These problems range from infotainment or build quality issues, but also battery, motor, and charging issues.
Hopefully, manufacturers get these issues under control, electric vehicles should be simpler and easier to own than ICE vehicles.",Kevin Williams
The Tesla Cybertruck Could Be An Insurance And Repair Nightmare,https://insideevs.com/news/699189/tesla-cybertruck-repair-insurance/,"DeLorean enthusiasts, body shop technicians, and insurance agents all weigh in on Tesla's stainless steel truck.",2023-12-05 16:34:42,"Elon Musk has delivered on his promise to get the Tesla Cybertruck into production. The wedge-shaped, Syd Mead meets Giorgetto Giugiaro design is out in the world, albeit with some design concessions from the concept version to make the whole package work. It might not go as far as originally promised, it’s more expensive than he originally said it would be, but the Cybertruck still looks very close to the concept Musk surprised us with back in 2019—stainless steel body panels and all. Those stainless steel body panels might be one of the truck’s biggest draws, but could they be its Achilles heel?
Musk and Tesla claim that the truck's hard surface is so damage-resistant that it can stop bullets. But like every material in the known physical realm, it can be broken. And when something gets broken, it’ll need to be repaired. That's where things get tricky here.
After all, there are only about a baker’s dozen’s worth of production Cybertrucks on the road. Coupled with Tesla’s notoriously rigorous and tight-lipped stance toward its trade secrets about repairability, we won’t know the explicit, granular details of how to repair the Cybertruck until there are more than a few on the road, and rumblings about the truck in private, go public.
Still, we all have eyes. The Cybertruck isn’t the first electric truck, not the first Tesla, and not the first vehicle to be made of stainless steel.
To get an idea of what Cybetruck owners might be in for when the going gets tough for their trucks, I reached out to a few sources familiar with autobody repair, stainless steel repair, fixing Teslas specifically, and other people with expert knowledge in this field.
The picture they painted is cautiously optimistic at best, but also earnest about the challenges the truck’s design presents. And those experts are adamant about how the truck could further test the often-contentious relationships between the consumer, auto body technicians and the insurance industry.
The Cybertruck is unusually stiff. Its 3mm thick stainless steel panels are undoubtedly an industry first. Musk bragged that traditional auto presses, which can exert literal tons of force, can’t even shape the stuff because it’s so thick and hard. It’s silly to expect that a standard PDR (paintless dent removal) guy could use their tools to hammer out any dents. Yet, not considering the Cybertruck’s proprietary metal alloy and absurd thickness, we already have at least a bit of a precedent of how to repair stainless steel—an example from the 1980s, when DeLoreans were still new and probably more on the road than they are today.
It takes a lot of labor to ensure the body panels remain straight and usable. Then, unlike normal car steel (or even aluminum) body panels, you can’t hide structurally sound, but visually unappealing, repairs behind body filler and paint since the trucks are unpainted. So, every repair has to be pitch-perfect, which isn’t easy, and, more crucially, very time-consuming.
This is why the stories behind painted DeLoreans often come from accident-involved vehicles; it didn’t make any financial sense to spend hours repairing a stainless steel panel. Instead, some owners and body shop guys would use traditional techniques involving body filler, and then opt to paint the car.
“Repairing stainless steel is a novelty,” said Josh Bengston, owner and operator of DeLorean Industries, in Tallmadge, Ohio. His company repairs DMC-12s and sells parts for them. Although our conversation was short, Bengston was pointed and direct. Repairing stainless steel really only makes sense for classic and collector cars like the DeLorean where replacements might not exist, and the cars themselves are special, rare items for hobbyists.
James Espey, president of another shop, Classic DMC, was a little more optimistic. But he agreed that the labor to repair stainless steel isn’t easy. Espey described some of the repair processes of DeLorean panels as “old school,” where they’re using pick and files, not the computerized body shop tools to beat out divots and dings. It’s an art form that takes a lot more time than the average steel fender. “If you're going to spend more than say, eight, nine hours trying to do a repair, you’re better off just buying a new (panel),” Espey said.
Those concerns of an elevated labor cost were shared amongst a Facebook group full of novice and veteran auto body repair technicians. Sure, the Cybertruck’s panels will potentially be able to be repaired like DeLoreans were, but there’s the big question: will insurance companies approve labor-intensive repairs? High labor totals out cars; they’re why one Ohio driver’s Rivian R1T repair came out to a whopping $42,000 for what appeared to be a basic fender bender. High repair bills like that are the things that total out trucks, as some Rivian owners are learning.
Replacing panels would likely be significantly quicker (and thus represent lower labor costs) than repairing them, insisting on replacing rather than repairing could open up a new can of worms. Arguably, it’s only exacerbating the current stress points Tesla owners are already experiencing with their insurance companies: long waits for repair times, and high repair costs, even before Tesla’s controversial choice to go with stainless steel panels.
More Cybertruck
“So a lot of customers hire me to fight insurance companies because insurance companies do not want to pay what Tesla requires you do to return a vehicle to pre-loss condition,” said Billy Walkowiak, the CEO of Collision Safety Consultants, a firm in part meant to serve as an advocate and adjudicator for insurance claimants who may not feel like the insurance company is effectively making them whole. “I personally probably do 10 to 15 Teslas a week,” he said.
Walkowiak explained that although we can’t quite yet know what’s going to happen with the Cybertruck, Tesla’s repair procedures have historically skewed toward replacement of parts, rather than repairing parts strategy. Add in the complicated software recalibration procedures and elevated labor costs—only Tesla-certified technicians can repair Tesla vehicles—and it all gets expensive very quickly. Walkowiak shared a Tesla Model 3 claim that was $22,000, with $14,000 of that solely being replacement parts. Yikes.
“Tesla's getting challenged because insurance companies now have their greedy little hands into the estimating software program,"" Walkowiak said. ""And they can say that they don’t believe it needs that we [the body shop says] because according to the [insurance company’s] software, it doesn't need that, or [they’re] not paying for that, or that's too expensive.""
Be that as it may, the replacement parts strategy that will likely apply to the Cybertruck could create a new problem: can Tesla even make enough parts to keep up?
“I remember reading stories in the automotive trade press about how replacement parts for the Model S and the 3 the Y, and the X were all short supply items because they were building everything they could make. [Tesla] hadn't allocated enough spare parts is how I understood it,” Espey added.
Tesla’s part repair woes have gotten somewhat better in recent years, but it’s not all that hard to find reports on social media of Tesla owners upset that their repairs take a long time, with wait times upward of six months. “The DeLorean company was really good about making every dealer buy a certain subset of spare parts, including body panels,"" Epsey said. “Is every Tesla service center going to have body panels on hand to ship?”
He also cast doubt on any availability of outside OEM parts. Since the Cybertruck is purportedly using a custom stainless steel alloy, it’s not clear if third-party companies will be able to create aftermarket body panels for the truck.
Still, Espey wasn't all doom and gloom on the Cybetruck. Later in our conversation, he compared the Cybertruck’s stainless steel panels to the Ford F-150’s aluminum body—something that was intensely controversial when it first came out.
Of course, there are some lingering feelings about the costs and techniques of repairing an aluminum car, but by and large, the auto body repair industry has adapted. (The vast popularity of the F-150 has a way of doing that.) These days, aluminum body repair is kind of a non-issue, although some body shop guys do insist the elevated costs associated with repairing them are still very much an issue.
Employees at another Ohio body shop I spoke to (that includes a 7,000-square-foot dedicated EV repair space) were more optimistic too. They insisted Tesla usually gives out good training on how to repair its vehicles, a sentiment seconded by other industry professionals I surveyed for this story. It's very possible the automaker—which does not speak to the press in America—has a plan for repairs that we're not privy to yet.
However, collision repair involves more than just the physical act of pulling out a dent and paying a body shop guy. There are a lot of moving pieces at work here, and it’s not clear how the Cybertruck will fare when the chips fall where they may.",Kevin Williams
EV Adoption Is Slow Because There Aren’t Enough Affordable Compact SUVs: J.D. Power,https://insideevs.com/news/699388/ev-adoption-slow-because-few-mass-market-compact-suvs-exist-jd-power/,A lackluster charging infrastructure and high prices are also among the reasons why Americans reject EVs.,2023-12-05 12:46:55,"There’s been a lot of conflicting news lately about the American electric car market. On the one hand, some new EVs are collecting dust for weeks on end on dealer lots, while others are selling like hotcakes.
While contrasting, both are true. But why? Well, J.D. Power’s latest E-Vision Intelligence Report for November 2023 tries to shed some light on the issue.
First, the problem of swollen dealer inventories. According to J.D. Power, the majority of reasons–7 in 10–quoted by people who are considering buying an EV simply do not exist in the case of combustion engines: lack of charging station availability, time required to charge, limited driving distance, and inadequate performance during extreme temperatures. Pricing is also an issue, with most EVs being more expensive than their ICE counterparts.
As for the record sales numbers seen by some manufacturers, the story is a bit more complicated that it first seems because the rate at which sales of battery-powered cars are advancing is still quite slow. According to J.D. Power, we’re still very much in the “early adopter” phase seeing how EVs account for just 8.2% of total new-vehicle sales in the United States.
It’s true that adoption is expected to rise in the following years, with a projected 13% by the end of next year, 19% by the end of 2025, and 24% by the end of 2026, but as it stands today, EVs are few and far between when looking at the big picture.
The main reason for this is that there isn’t enough choice where it matters, and that’s in the mainstream compact SUV segment, which is the biggest vehicle segment in the United States, with a market 16.5% market share. Not the premium compact SUV piece of the pie–that’s well taken care of, with 49.6% of sales represented by EVs.
More EV Stories
J.D. Power says that just 6% of all the non-premium compact SUVs sold are EVs, which is not enough to put a dent in the big scheme of things, and the pricing gap between comparable electric and combustion SUVs is a big factor.
As per the research company, the average retail price for a mass-market compact SUV is $52,000, while the average MSRP for a similar gas-powered vehicle is $34,000, or $18,000 less. For the price difference alone one could buy a brand-new Nissan Versa, Mitsubishi Mirage, or Kia Rio.
However, the premium compact SUV segment sees a smaller difference of just $4,000, with a new EV in this category costing $58,000 on average, while a comparable ICE vehicle goes for $54,000 on average. Yes, it’s more money, but a customer who’s willing to pay over $50,000 for a new car will be more inclined to take a second look at EVs because the price difference compared to ICE is not that big.
So what not-quite-premium crossovers can you get for less than $40,000? Not too many, unfortunately–at least right now–with the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Volvo EX30 among the few options on the table currently. The upcoming Fisker Pear is slated to cost just a smidge under $30,000 when it arrives in 2025, but we’ll believe it when we see it rolling off the assembly line.

A document from those negotiations indicated the UAW had secured a $391 million investment for a ""future electric vehicle"" at Fairfax Assembly in Kansas, which currently makes the Cadillac XT4 and Chevrolet Malibu. Sources told Reuters that the future EV that will be made in Kansas from 2025 is the next Chevy Bolt.
The launch timeline is also consistent with Mary Barra's remarks on GM's third-quarter earnings call in October. She said that giving the future Bolt a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery pack, and the fact it won't be a clean-sheet redesign, will contribute to ""getting to market at least two years faster."" LFP batteries are cheaper to build than their cobalt- and nickel-based variants, so while they store less energy, they are seen as a key technology for wider EV adoption; Tesla, Ford and other automakers are investing heavily into such batteries.
As a reminder, Barra said in October that the next-gen Chevy Bolt will leverage ""the best attributes of today's Bolt EUV, as well as Ultium, our latest software, and NACS."" This will also make the future Bolt GM's first deployment of LFP technology in the Ultium platform in North America. In doing so, GM will be saving ""billions in capital and engineering expense, delivering a significantly cost-improved battery pack using purchased LFP cells."" In addition, shifting to LFP will allow GM to have a ""substantially lower"" unit cost, Barra said.
While GM's  CEO did not provide range or price estimates for the LFP battery-powered Bolt, she said the vehicle ""will deliver an even better driving, charging, and ownership experience with a vehicle we know customers love.""
More stories on the future Chevrolet Bolt EV
GM has had an incredibly rocky path for its EV strategy this year. It has announced delays for several EV models—including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV RST, and GMC Sierra EV—as well as slower EV production and EV product spending cuts on its Q3 2023 earnings call.
The company also abandoned a goal to build 400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through mid-2024, although it reiterated its target to get to 1 million EVs of production by the end of 2025.
Last week, Barra admitted that GM has not executed well on its Ultium-based EV strategy this year as a manufacturing constraint has hampered battery module assembly, leading to a delayed start of electric pickup truck production at the Orion plant and the idling of the CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, until spring 2024.
Relaunching the Bolt may go a long way to fixing some of those problems. First launched in late 2016 and followed by the larger EUV variant in 2022, the Bolt has been a consistently popular seller in the U.S. despite not having the same fast-charging speeds as more modern EVs. But scores of buyers have been attracted to its low price tag, great range and compact utility. With any lucky, GM can pull a repeat with the next Bolt.",Dan Mihalascu
Here's Why The Tesla Cybertruck Might Never Make It To Europe (Updated),https://insideevs.com/news/699164/tesla-cybertruck-might-never-make-it-to-europe/,"Weight, a penchant for smaller-sized vehicles, and the charging port all make for a tough pill to swallow.",2023-12-05 03:39:37,"Update: Lars Moravy, Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, confirmed for TopGear Netherlands that the Cybertruck will likely never make it to Europe.
""First of all, the market for pickups in America is huge, and that is different with you,"" Moravy  told TopGear. ""And two: European regulations require a rounding of 3.2 millimeters on protruding parts. Unfortunately, it is impossible to make a rounding of 3.2 millimeters on a 1.4 millimeter sheet of stainless steel,"" he added.
The original story follows below.
The first production-spec Tesla Cybertruck units were finally delivered last week after four years of delays, rumors, and all sorts of weird remarks from CEO Elon Musk on what seems to be his preferred way of communicating with the world, the social media platform X.
But while American customers who placed an order for the angular all-electric pickup can expect to get their hands on the EV sometime next year, European reservation holders shouldn’t get their hopes up.
The reason for this is the spec sheet itself, which–while impressive–might make Tesla’s first-ever pickup a sort of forbidden fruit on the Old Continent.
With up to 845 horsepower on tap and a zero to 60 miles per hour sprint in just 2.6 seconds, the Cybertruck is a quick truck, but it’s also a heavy one. Tipping the scales at 6,843 pounds for the top-of-the-line Cyberbeast model with three electric motors and a battery that has about 123 kilowatt-hours (according to Carwow), the Cybertruck is simply too heavy to be driven with a regular car license in Europe.
In this part of the world, people with a so-called category B license (for regular passenger cars) can drive a vehicle that has a maximum gross weight rating of 3.5 tonnes, which is 7,716 lbs. While the Cybertruck’s weight is under the limit, the 6,843 lbs number doesn’t take the 2,500 lbs payload into account. Add that up and you get 9,343 lbs or 4,237 kg. And that’s without taking into account the weight of the passengers.
According to the official VIN decoder that was submitted to regulators earlier this year, the Cybertruck has two possible gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR):
More Cybertruck Stories
As you can see, the lowest rating is already above the European limit. This would mean that–if it were to be sold in Europe–a Cybertruck customer would need to have a category C license which is meant for vehicles that have a GVWR of over 3.5 tonnes or 7,716 lbs.
In other words, a truck license. Speaking as a European myself, I know it costs more to get such a license compared to a regular B-type license and fewer people go to the trouble of getting one–why would they, if they don’t plan on driving a truck? So, not ideal for a vehicle that’s meant to be mass-produced and sold in high numbers.
Another factor that might make the Cybertruck an American-only affair is the limited appeal big pickups have had over the years in Europe. Smaller trucks like the Toyota Hilux, Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton), Volkswagen Amarok, and Ford Ranger rule the segment on the Old Continent, so a truck as big as Tesla’s would have a hard time making a name for itself in this part of the world.
""Pickup trucks are somewhat small in terms of market adoption in comparison to what you see in the U.S. market,"" said Pedro Pacheco, vice president of research at Gartner for Business Insider.
""For a vehicle in the category of the Cybertruck, there's not a huge market in Europe, because pickup trucks generally are not very common,"" he added.
Other Electric Pickups
And lastly, there’s the issue of the charging port. While Tesla’s so-called North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector is on the brink of becoming the de facto choice among EVs that are destined for the U.S. and Canadian markets, Europe has embraced the CCS2 plug. Even the European Tesla Superchargers come with a CCS2 connector.
So, to sell the Cybertruck in this neck of the woods, the Austin-based carmaker would have to somehow implement the CCS2 plug on the Cybertruck. That means hardware and software tweaks that Tesla might consider too big of a bother in the grand scheme of things.
Hard numbers are hard to come by because pickups are usually bundled with other light commercial vehicles like vans, but in 2020, just 116,280 pickups were sold in Europe, according to this Automotive News piece from two years ago.
That’s a far cry from the roughly three million pickups that were sold in the United States in 2020, making it an even less appealing market for Tesla, which wants to sell as many as 250,000 Cybertrucks per year by 2025.",Iulian Dnistran
GM CEO Expects ‘Significantly Higher’ EV Production In 2024,https://insideevs.com/news/698592/gm-significantly-higher-ev-production-2024/,Mary Barra said the company was “a bit disappointed” because of the manufacturing restraints in building EV battery cells.,2023-11-30 10:15:38,"General Motors is confident that its electric vehicle production will be “significantly higher” next year, CEO Mary Barra said yesterday. The news comes after several less-than-stellar (but growing) financial quarters where GM slowly increased production but remained well under 30,000 units per quarter since the beginning of the year.
“Frankly, we didn’t execute well this year as it relates to demonstrating our EV capability,” Barra said, quoted by Automotive News. “I am very confident with the EV portfolio that we have and the work that we’ve done to deliver significantly more Ultium-based products that customers, I think, will really appreciate.”
GM’s head honcho reiterated that it’s working to overcome a manufacturing constraint that has hampered the assembly of battery modules for its Ultium-based EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and GMC Sierra EV.
General Motors EV lineup
In a surprise move, the company announced that it will boost its dividend by 33% next year and repurchase $10 billion worth of shares, making it its biggest-ever buyback plan, according to Bloomberg. These, along with two other points on the company’s investor-focused agenda–reinstating the 2023 earnings guide and cutting spending on the Cruise robotaxi venture–resulted in a roughly 10% bump in the share price.
At the same time, however, the increased financial burden following the signing of a new labor contract with representatives of the United Auto Workers union–which will cost GM $9.3 billion through 2028–made some analysts uneasy about the automaker’s ability to pull through.
Barra responded by saying that GM will offset the increased labor costs “completely” by sticking to its four-pillar strategy.
“Our strategy is clear,” Mary Barra said during an interview with Bloomberg. “It’s really based on four pillars of executing our strong internal-combustion engine program vehicles, we’re performing very well on the market and we see that we’re below the average incentives. I think that speaks to the strength of our internal combustion engine products,” Barra added.
“From an EV perspective, we have confidence in the portfolio we have. We’re a bit disappointed this year that we were constrained by the automation to build [battery] modules, so this is not something that is fundamentally an issue with Ultium, it was more a manufacturing automation issue that we’re working on and we’ll be out of it by the middle of next year, and making improvements every quarter,” General Motors’ head said.
Software and autonomy are also part of the company’s strategy to turn things around. The introduction of more affordable EVs such as the Equinox and next-gen Ultium-based Bolt is also expected to drive adoption.
GM “never saw EV adoption as a straight line,” Barra explained, adding that while the growth rate has decreased, it’s still growing.

Hyundai Motor Will Halt One Of Its ICE Vehicle Factories To Build A New EV Plant,https://insideevs.com/news/698472/hyundai-motor-stops-ice-factory-to-build-ev-plant-korea/,Other manufacturers claim their EV sales are slow due to weak demand. So how come Hyundai is charging ahead?,2023-11-29 13:08:09,"Hyundai Motor, the company that owns and operates the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis car brands, will pause operations at one of its South Korean factories to focus its attention on building a brand-new electric vehicle plant.
According to Reuters, citing a regulatory filing, the East Asian automaker will halt its factory in Asan between December 31, 2023 and February 13, 2024. The Asan facility is described on the company’s website as being a “state-of-the-art self-sufficient factory” that manufactures passenger vehicles for export and operates an “environment-friendly solar farm on rooftops.”
Hyundai makes the Sonata and Grandeur combustion models here, but also the Ioniq 6 electric sedan.
The car group’s efforts will be directed toward the construction of a new EV-only plant at its main manufacturing complex in Ulsan, which is on the other side of the Korean peninsula. The Ulsan facility is the world’s largest single automobile plant, according to Hyundai Motor, comprising five independent plants that make cars like the Hyundai Kona, Santa Fe, and Tucson, as well as Genesis models like the GV80 and G90, among others.
The EV-only manufacturing facility will become the sixth plant at the Ulsan complex and–once it goes online in 2026–will be responsible for assembling the all-new Genesis GV90 flagship electric SUV.
As reported by The Korean Car Blog earlier this month, the GV90 will be the group’s first model based on the new Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) that’s designed to simplify the assembly processes and lower costs.
But when everything is said and done, how come the Korean auto group is marching ahead with its EV plans, while other names like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen are citing weak demand for battery-powered cars and slowing down their momentum?
Ford said that its Michigan battery plant will be smaller than initially planned, with an annual output of 20 gigawatt-hours instead of the originally planned 35 GWh. Additionally, construction at one of the two EV battery plants in Kentucky has been delayed.
On the same pessimistic note, GM delayed the market launch of the Equinox EV crossover, as well as the production of some Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV models until late 2025. Volkswagen slowed production at one of its European EV factories more than once because of less-than-stellar sales results and its CEO recently went on record saying that the people’s car brand has to tie up a lot of loose ends because it’s no longer competitive.
Hyundai Motor, on the other hand, outpaced all of its competitors except Tesla in terms of EV sales in the United States in the third quarter with over 28,000 battery-powered cars reaching customers. By comparison, Ford sold a smidge under 21,000 EVs while the Volkswagen Group and General Motors sold about 20,000 each.
Hyundai Motor Group was also ahead of all the other legacy automakers in the first three quarters of the year with approximately 62,000 EVs sold in the US, ahead of GM with 56,000 and the Volkswagen Group with almost 50,000 units.
In other words, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the Korean company is keeping its steady pace of expansion in the EV space. If sales are good, it makes sense to pour more money into the business so that they can sell even more later.
Hyundai has pledged to invest about $5.5 billion in a new EV factory in the state of Georgia, plus an additional $3 billion for research and development. That said, the Ulsan EV plant will gobble another $1.58 billion, bringing the total investment to roughly $10 billion in just a few short years.

Volkswagen Boss Warns 'We Are No Longer Competitive',https://insideevs.com/news/698154/volkswagen-boss-warns-no-longer-competitive/,"The company plans massive cost-cutting, including staff reductions.",2023-11-28 13:17:20,"Volkswagen Group—Europe's largest automotive group—has encountered some serious challenges as its main brand needs to cut costs on a massive scale.
According to Reuters, Volkswagen Brand CEO Thomas Schaefer warned the staff during a meeting at the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg that costs are too high, while productivity is too low, which together makes the cars uncompetitive: ""With many of our pre-existing structures, processes and high costs, we are no longer competitive as the Volkswagen brand.""
The German manufacturer is now working on a $10.9 billion (€10 billion) savings program, which will include staff reductions, the report says.
The amount of cost cuts is quite significant—equivalent to at least two large factories. It's not clear yet how the company will achieve its goal but details will be defined by the end of this year.
Gunnar Kilian, Volkswagen human resources board member said: ""We need to finally be brave and honest enough to throw things overboard that are being duplicated within the company or are simply ballast we don't need for good results.""
It seems that the situation is serious. As far as electric cars are concerned, Volkswagen was recently forced to slow down production at some of its plants in Europe. In some cases, the slowdowns were due to parts supply issues, and in others, because of insufficient demand.
Assuming that the company mages to reduce its costs and improve productivity, buyers should see lower prices.

France: 125 Million Euros Towards Development Of Cycling Infrastructure,https://insideevs.com/news/698005/france-125-million-funding-cycling-infrastructure/,France is once again rolling out funding for cycling-focused infrastructure projects.,2023-11-28 08:39:16,"Active mobility, particularly cycling, has seen monumental growth all over the world in recent years. Europe, in particular, is experiencing a surge in bike use – with electric bicycles specifically enjoying steady growth. In fact, in Germany, e-bikes are expected to surpass regular bikes in terms of sales figures in 2023.
That being said, as more and more people embrace biking as a means of mobility, Governments are working towards improving cycling-focused infrastructure. While this is something a lot of people would certainly love to see in the US, it seems that there’s still a long way to go until we begin to see bicycles integrated into the mainstream mobility scene. Perhaps we can take a few hints from our friends over in Europe, particularly in France.
Back in May, 2023, it was announced that France was to invest two billion euros towards the development of cycling infrastructure throughout the country. This time around, the French government has announced yet another call for cycling development projects, with the latest one being the seventh call for projects. The program is part of the country’s 2023 to 2027 cycling and walking plan, and will see the injection of a 125 million-euro budget. Come April, 2024, this budget is expected to double, opening doors to even more projects.
The project is headed by Christophe Béchu, the Minister of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion, and Clément Beaune, the Minister Delegate for Transport. Through this project, it’s hoped that France’s network of cycling routes would expand even further. Quite frankly, France is one of the most bullish when it comes to pushing for cycling-focused initiatives, so it’s certainly interesting to see how far they can push this. More specifically, the project involves the construction not just of new cycle paths, but also of greenways and dedicated bridges to accommodate cyclists.
More Fun On Two Wheels:
While the call for cycling-focused projects is open to the entirety of France, the program emphasizes an inclusive approach by focusing on regions with a lower population density, so as to ensure that these communities are not left behind when it comes to the development of mobility infrastructure. At present, the government has instituted a window from November 22, 2023, to March 8, 2024, for communities and regions to submit applications for projects. Following this, grants will be announced in July, 2024.

Here’s How BYD Rocked Toyota’s Manufacturing World,https://insideevs.com/news/696789/toyota-byd-ev-partnership-manufacturing-interview/,"Once a leader in manufacturing efficiency, Toyota learned a lot from Chinese automaker BYD.",2023-11-17 08:57:22,"Toyota has long been accused of being a latecomer in the electric vehicle game. But this year, the Japanese automaker that made a name for itself for its manufacturing prowess, announced some ambitious plans to step up its EV efforts.
These include giga casting techniques, a next-gen assembly line that makes use of autonomous cars that drive themselves down the line, and advancements in battery technology that should result in driving ranges of around 900 miles after 2028. 10 EVs based on an all-new architecture will also debut starting in 2026.
But all of this might have never been possible without a massive wake-up call from Chinese car maker BYD, which was Toyota’s partner in the development of the all-electric bZ3 sedan.
According to a Toyota Times interview with the Japanese company’s newly established BEV Factory’s president, Takero Kato, he was shocked during a business trip to China.
“For the first time, I came face to face with the competitiveness of Chinese components,” Kato said. “In China, they were not simply learning and applying technologies, but also rapidly transforming manufacturing.”
“Laying eyes on equipment that I had never seen in Japan and their state-of-the-art manufacturing, I was struck by a sense of crisis – ’We’re in trouble!’ At the same time, I began to think that I would like to spend the rest of my career in China,” he added.
This sense of realization came when Toyota started collaborating with BYD for the Chinese-market bZ3 sedan, which is based on the Japanese manufacturer’s e-TNGA platform but uses the Chinese maker’s Blade batteries.
As Kato says, the development of the electric sedan was marked by constant change. A particularly eye-opening experience came five months after the vehicle’s height and wheelbase were modified, which is a huge change in and of itself.
“The overall height was lowered by around 25 millimeters [0.9 inches], so the underbody had to be entirely redone. In Japan, that would have brought the entire development to a standstill,” Toyota’s BEV Factory chief said. “Regardless, everyone agreed on the change because we were committed to putting out a product that would make customers happy. Deep down, it seemed like a complete write-off, but we had to go for it,” he added.
While testing the bZ3 in Mongolia, Kato was summoned for an interview with Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s Chairman, and Koji Sato, the company’s CEO. During the meeting, he was asked to return to Japan and take the helm of the Vehicle Development Center, which handles everything from planning to mass-production development.
Fast-forward to July 2023, and Toyota is holding its annual General Shareholders’ Meeting in Tokyo. Here, Kato takes the microphone and says: “I love BEVs.” But was this scripted?
In this latest interview with Toyota Times, he explains that he truly believes what he said four months ago. “That was not lip service — I meant every word. Electric vehicles have unique qualities and driving performance only found in EVs.”

GM Quietly Gets Into The Gigacasting Game After Buying Key Tesla Supplier,https://insideevs.com/news/696594/gm-buys-tesla-gigacasting-partner-tei/,The move should help General Motors lower the cost of its upcoming EVs.,2023-11-16 13:04:18,"General Motors acquired one of the most well-regarded sand-casting specialists in the world – and one of Tesla’s rapid prototyping partners – earlier this year, quietly entering the gigacasting game, as shown in a Reuters report published by Automotive News.
Tooling & Equipment International, or TEI, has worked with Tesla to develop gigacasting mold prototyping for the Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck, and Semi, all while dramatically cutting development time and costs during the process.
By using casts made out of industrial sand with 3D printing, TEI, along with three other suppliers, helped Tesla halve the time it takes to develop a car from the ground up, going from three to four years to 24 months at most.
GM And EVs
But not anymore. Since July 2023, TEI has become part of GM’s Global Manufacturing division which oversees all of GM’s automobile and parts manufacturing operations, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
""General Motors acquired Tooling & Equipment International (TEI) to bolster its portfolio of innovations and secure access to unique casting technology,"" GM said in a statement.
The American car manufacturer first came in contact with TEI’s know-how when it approached the supplier to test and produce some underbody castings for the upcoming $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq, a source told Reuters. As luck would have it, TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for those Celestiq castings.
General Motors isn’t the only so-called legacy automaker to go down the gigacasting path that Tesla carved. Earlier this year, Toyota announced that it too will employ the technique for its next-gen electric vehicles which are expected to hit the road in 2026. Volvo, Ford, and Hyundai are also going down this route.
Gigacasting essentially means that a car has fewer but bigger metal components, which reduces complexity and manufacturing costs. Where a current vehicle might have a front subframe assembly made out of dozens of individual parts, a next-gen vehicle might have a single-piece subframe thanks to gigacasting.
Mind you, TEI was not responsible for the massive die-casting machines that Tesla is using in its factories. Instead, it – and others like it – makes test molds out of industrial sand using digital design files and 3D printers known as binder jets. These build a sand mold that can then cast molten alloys.
Compared to legacy casting techniques, this prototyping method enables a sand mold to be modified and reprinted quickly if adjustments are needed, with minimal cost.

"Pricing Is Still The Biggest Barrier For EV Buyers, Study Reveals",https://insideevs.com/news/696412/pricing-biggest-barrier-ev-adoption-survey/,That’s despite the fact that prices have dropped significantly.,2023-11-15 11:38:05,"The high purchase price of an electric vehicle is the biggest barrier for potential buyers on a global scale, a recent study from S&P Global Mobility shows. Almost half of all respondents to the survey listed affordability as the main concern when considering a new EV, followed by worries about charging and range anxiety.
Although the average price of new EVs has gone down dramatically in the last year, out of the almost 7,500 people surveyed, 48 percent said EV prices are too high, even though they understand that most EVs inherently carry a price premium. The study’s authors say that one of the reasons for this result is that price fatigue has set in, driven by rising interest rates and inventory shortages that have only recently seen relief.
Changes in the federal tax credit program in the United States now force customers to lease instead of purchase many models, which means more money needs to be spent out of pocket.
Furthermore, even though range anxiety and charging concerns have been relegated to the bottom end of the podium when it comes to EV adoption worries, the openness to purchasing an electric vehicle has gone down in recent years.
This year, S&P Global Mobility’s survey revealed that 67 percent of respondents were open to the idea of getting an EV. In 2022, the percentage was at 71 percent, and in 2021 it was at 86 percent.
On the charging front, about 46 percent of respondents were concerned about the time it takes to charge an EV, while 44 percent were concerned about the availability of charging stations. According to the study’s results, most of the respondents said they were willing to wait between 30 minutes and an hour to recharge.
Genesis GV60 at a Tesla Supercharging station
""Consumers know (charging) will not be the standard gas station in-and-out experience,"" said Yanina Mills, senior technical research analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""But they don't want to delay for much more time than what would be a lunch break.""
When it comes to home charging, there’s a slight disconnect between the number of people who think this is the best and most common way to recharge an EV and the number of people who actually charge at home.
Respondents confirmed that home charging at night is considered best practice, but only 51 percent of current and repeat EV owners have a charger installed at home, while 42 percent of owners typically charge their cars this way.
Lucid Air charging at home charger
So, where do people charge their EVs if not at home? The survey revealed that a variety of places are frequented by owners, including streets, highways, and during work. As for those who do charge at home, they aren’t in a hurry, with 31 percent of responders not willing to pay extra to upgrade to a faster Level 2 charger from the included Level 1 charger that comes with the car.
When it comes to range anxiety, most respondents said they would accept a minimum EV range below 300 miles, while only 29 percent would prefer a minimum range above 300 miles.
Almost every new EV on sale today meets these requirements, so, logically, range anxiety is no longer the biggest issue for prospective buyers.
S&P Global Mobility surveyed 7,449 respondents from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, India, Thailand, Japan, and mainland China on May 23.

The U.S. Is ‘10 To 20 Years Behind Asia’ In Battery Manufacturing And Research: Report,https://insideevs.com/news/695605/us-behind-asia-battery-production-tech-senators-report/,A letter signed by two U.S. senators urges the Energy Department to step up America’s battery research game.,2023-11-10 11:17:56,"The United States is lagging behind Asia when it comes to battery research, manufacturing, and procurement of raw materials, according to a letter signed by two influential Democratic U.S. senators that was seen by Reuters.
The letter, which was written by Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner and Energy Committee Chair Joe Manchin, cites experts who say that the U.S. is “ten to twenty years behind Asia in commercialization of battery technology.”
The heart of the problem lies in China’s grip on the world’s battery cell production and America’s inability to rise to the challenge. As the letter notes, China makes more than 75 percent of the battery cells at a global level, while the United States managed to produce less than 10 percent of the world’s lithium-ion batteries last year.
Moreover, China dominates the globe’s battery supply chain, including graphite, which is required for almost all lithium-ion cells. This is particularly worrying, as China decided to restrict exports of graphite last month, making it harder to manufacture the anodes of the cells.
Demand is expected to grow seven times by 2035, so the U.S. has to do something about this situation. As a result, the letter states that a committee briefing has to take place by Dec. 1 “on ongoing research and development of next-generation battery technologies.”
A previous unreported letter seen by Reuters underlines the importance of the U.S. becoming a leader in manufacturing batteries and battery components, as well as securing supply chains for the materials that make up those components.
U.S.-Made Batteries
National security is also a part of the discussion, as the Pentagon has said in the past that lithium-ion batteries are crucial to thousands of military systems, including handheld ratios, unmanned submersibles, and future capabilities like lasers, directed energy weapons and hybrid electric tactical vehicles, according to the latest letter signed by the two senators.
Currently, China controls between 60 and 100 percent of the mining or refining capacity for five critical materials used for making most types of lithium-ion batteries, the letter said, adding that “it is critical that the U.S. lead in next-generation battery technology and alternate chemistries.”
The two senators’ latest letter comes after the European Union opened a formal probe into the subsidies received by Chinese electric car manufacturers that are trying to flood the market with cheap EVs. The probe was blasted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce as being “protectionist.”
In the United States, Chinese-made vehicles are subject to a 25 percent tariff that comes on top of the regular 2.5 percent import tariff for imported cars.

2023 LA Auto Show: Here Are All The New Vehicle Debuts,https://www.motor1.com/news/695331/2023-la-auto-show-debuts/,"Several automakers will unveil new or restyled models at the show, which opens to the public on November 17.",2024-12-25 07:32:38,"Update: Added Toyota Camry to the list and updated the Mustang GT California Special.
Friends, can you believe 2023 is nearly over? Here we are, talking about vehicles slated to debut at this year's LA Auto Show. It opens to the public on Friday, November 17, but doors for the media open a day earlier.
There are some notable debuts taking place this year, but we aren't expecting a flurry of activity as we did a few weeks ago at the Japan Mobility Show. And lest we forget, Stellantis backed out of the action due to the UAW strike. As a result, the new 2025 Ram and electric range-extended Ramcharger – that probably would've debuted at the show – already had their moments in the spotlight.
As of now, that leaves us with four proper debuts from major brands featuring either completely new vehicles, or updates of existing models. Here's a quick rundown of what to expect from the major brands, and check back often. Sometimes an automaker or two will surprise us leading up to the show; we will update this list as more automakers announce their debuts.
This is very likely a next-generation Subaru Forester, though we haven't heard anything official on that. Our email inbox received the above teaser photo from Subaru on November 2, promising something all new and fully redesigned. The key word here is redesigned, as it points to a thorough makeover of an existing Subie. Currently in its fifth generation, the Forester is the oldest model in Subaru's stable having been launched in 2018. The timing is appropriate for a sixth-gen version to arrive.
It's been over three years since Lucid announced its second production vehicle – the Gravity SUV. Much has happened in the world since then, but to Lucid's credit, development has continued, and we're finally ready to see the production version up close. It will be offered in a choice of two-row or three-row seating configurations, and since we're talking about Lucid, a crazy-powerful performance trim on par with the Tesla Model X Plaid is all but guaranteed.
The Crown is still a fresh nameplate in North America, having debuted in July 2022 as a high-riding sedan with serious crossover vibes. In Japan, however, Crown badges adorn several models including a spiffy SUV called Estate. It's coming to America, though Toyota has been cagey regarding the name. Whether it's called Crown Estate or something else, expect a bit more ride height and cargo space compared to the sedan. Under the skin, it will likely carry the same all-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain with up to 340 horsepower offered in Hybrid Max spec.
Sedans aren't dead by a long shot, and Toyota is committed to the segment with the next-generation Camry. Teaser images suggest it will borrow some styling cues from the Prius, but the big news is what's happening beneath the skin. HEV AWD badges suggest it could get the same powertrain as the aforementioned Crown, possibly delivering up to 340 hp. The current-generation sedan entered production in 2017, and its popularity hasn't waned over the years. In 2022 it was the fifth best-selling vehicle in the US, beating notable models like the GMC Sierra and Honda CR-V.
While not a new model per se, the GT California Special marks the first mainstream special-edition Mustang since the seventh generation's launch in 2022. The new pony debuted on November 9, contrary to the clever 11/11/23 clue hidden in a teaser image. It turns out that's the date the GT/CS makes its public debut, appearing at the South OC Cars and Coffee event at the Outlets of San Clemente, south of LA. It will still be at the show, bringing its special grille, blue accents, and other California Special appearance tweaks to attendees for the weeklong event.

Bigger E-Bike Subsidies And Tax Credits On The Horizon,https://insideevs.com/news/694799/ebike-discounts-subsidies-incoming/,"With governments looking to make e-bike ownership easier than ever before, now may be the best time to make the two-wheeled shift.",2023-11-06 14:52:31,"If I were to ask you your thoughts about e-bikes, chances are I’d get a bunch of mixed reactions. On the one hand, a lot of people are extremely optimistic about the future of mobility, and see electric bikes and other personal mobility devices as essential in paving the way forward. On the other hand, there are skeptics who question the very essence of e-bikes, labeling them as pointless, gimmicky, and more of a problem than the solution.
Nevertheless, the numbers don’t lie, and it’s foreseen that the e-bike business will balloon into a $120 billion industry by 2030. Indeed, when properly regulated, electric bikes have proven to be an effective replacement for cars when it comes to urban mobility, providing multifaceted benefits to its users, as well as society as a whole. As such, it’s no surprise that governments are taking big steps in promoting e-bike adoption within their localities. Indeed, we need not look far, as in the US, we can soon expect bigger financial incentives for people looking to get into the e-bike fold.
These incentives are government-funded projects which include rebates, tax credits, and discounts making electric bicycles more affordable and accessible for a wider audience. In an article by Electrek, it’s stated that Colorado offers one of the most significant e-bike incentive programs, providing up to $1,800 in subsidies. That’s quite a huge chunk of change, as some entry-level e-bikes are priced even lower than $1,800. Other states such as California are also reportedly developing their own incentive programs, although specific details have yet to be confirmed as of this writing.
The rapidly growing popularity of electric bicycles in the US is also putting a lot of pressure on cities to improve cycling infrastructure. If we fix our gaze over to Europe, we’ll have seen some massive cycling-focused initiatives in countries like Germany, Sweden, and The Netherlands, so much so that these projects seem to be outpacing mainstream transportation infrastructure developments. At the very least, we’re looking at massive integration projects that focus on safety, accessibility, and road-sharing among car drivers and VRUs (vulnerable road users).
In Case You Missed It:
It goes without saying that the US could benefit from widespread e-bike adoption, particularly in cities that have been experiencing worsening traffic conditions. E-bikes have also proven to be good for their users’ health and wellbeing, promoting an active lifestyle and exploring the great outdoors. These days, consumers are spoiled for choice with the vast selection of models available on the market. We recently talked about ultra affordable bikes such as the Lectric XPeak, a machine that serves as a solid springboard into the world of e-mobility. On the flipside, there are also tons of fancy e-bikes that blur the line between mobility and lifestyle.

Here’s How Stellantis Wants To Bring Cheap EVs To The Masses,https://insideevs.com/news/694123/stellantis-leapmotor-joint-venture-cheap-evs/,Spoiler alert: it involves a Chinese manufacturer.,2023-10-31 13:30:43,"Stellantis, the automotive behemoth that has no fewer than 16 brands in its portfolio, including Dodge, Fiat, and Jeep, wants to make cheap EVs more readily available with a bit of help from a new Chinese partner called Leapmotor.
After a $1.6 billion (1.5 billion Euro) investment, Stellantis will own a 20 percent equity stake in Leapmotor’s parent company, and the two will set up a joint venture that will – you guessed it – export the Chinese manufacturer’s battery-powered cars in other parts of the world.
The new JV, called Leapmotor International, will be incorporated in the Netherlands and the first market to get the affordable Chinese EVs will be Europe, with more scheduled to follow, according to Stellantis’ third-quarter financial results call.
In other words, the United States might finally get a low-cost but technologically advanced EV thanks to Stellantis’ latest venture, but until that happens, we’ll have to wait and see how Leapmotor’s cars will fare on the Old Continent, where there are already a few sub-$25,000 EVs to choose from.
In fact, Citroen, which is part of Stellantis, recently revealed the new European-built e-C3, which starts at around $24,500 (23,300 Euro). There’s also the Chinese-made Dacia Spring from rival company Renault that goes from $24,000 (22,750 Euro) on the list of no-frills EVs, so it will be interesting to see how the automotive group will price the cars it will be importing to Europe.
The cheapest model made by Leapmotor, the pint-sized T03 that measures just 142.5 inches long, starts at about $10,900 (RMB 79,500) in China, before tariffs and country-specific value-added tax (VAT), so there is some wiggle room, at least at first sight.
But Leapmotor also makes the more expensive C01 sedan and C11 SUV, along with their extended-range (EREV) versions, so the jury is still out on how Stellantis will market these Chinese cars on the Old Continent, especially considering how Leapmotor has focused on the mid- to the high-end market in its home country, according to Stellantis’ own press release.
The first batch of exported EVs will reach European shores next year, with the newly formed joint venture targeting 500,000 sales outside of China by 2030, plus an additional one million cars per year in China in the long term.
Stellantis CFO Natalie Knight said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the new brand is aimed at consumers “who are cost conscious but want the best technology in their products,” referring to Leapmotor vehicles’ ability to receive over-the-air (OTA) updates, as well as their proprietary “Four-Leaf Clover” Leap 3.0 centrally-controlled electric and electronic architecture.
With all this in mind, do you think a cheap, Chinese-made EV sold by Stellantis will ever make it to the United States? Let us know in the comments below.

Toyota FT-Se Electric Sports Car Has Dual Motors And All-Wheel Drive,https://www.motor1.com/news/693790/toyota-ft-se-specs-performance/,The chief engineer says it will rival the electric Porsche Cayman and estimates it'll hit 60 mph in three seconds.,2024-12-25 07:32:41,"When Toyota unveiled the FT-Se at the Japan Mobility Show, all we got were some photos of a sweet little sports car with two seats and no combustion engine. Hideaki Iida, the project manager for the Gazoo Racing Design Group and the man who penned the concept, told our sister site InsideEVs that a production version could arrive after 2026. Other sources within the company alluded to our colleagues that it could have a simulated manual gearbox.
Now, more pieces of the puzzle are falling into place thanks to Top Gear magazine. The FT-Se has dual motors with one driving the front axle and the other the rear wheels for an AWD setup with a rear-biased behavior. These motors draw their juice from a ""special"" third-generation battery pack, for which cooling is going to pose a challenge during a planned Nürburgring hot lap.
The Green Hell is one of the longest racing tracks in the world as the Nordschleife layout is 12.94 miles (20.83 kilometers) long. The layout used for the 24-hour endurance race is even longer, at 15.7 miles (25.3 kilometers). The FT-Se's chief engineer Fumihiko Hazama told TG the company already has a target lap time in mind that he doesn't want to divulge for now.
""Cooling the battery around the Nürburgring will be very difficult. It's hard driving around a long course which makes the battery temperature higher. Cooling will be important for this car’s performance. For its speed.""
He estimated it'll do 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in three seconds, so a 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) sprint could drop below the three-second mark. Flat out, it's projected to reach 155 mph (250 km/h). Although the car's weight remains a mystery, Hazama gives us hope it won't be a porker. Mounted low in the center of the car, the new battery pack is said to be lighter than what's currently in use.
The body will use a combination of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), aluminum, and steel. Ideally, the goal is to make the FT-Se ""light and stiff at the same time"" while integrating some clever aero trickery, including a big diffuser for extra downforce.
As to the model's positioning in the range, Hideaki Iida told InsideEVs the sports car is not linked to an MR2 revival or an electric Supra.

"Hyundai Motor Sees Record Profit In Q3, Keeps Its EV Plans On Track",https://insideevs.com/news/693556/hyundai-record-q3-profit-ev-plans-on-track/,The news comes after Ford and General Motors delayed or abandoned some of their electric vehicle production goals.,2023-10-27 08:19:36,"Hyundai Motor, which includes the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis car brands, posted its third-quarter financial results today, and it’s good news for the Korean automaker.
The car manufacturer posted a record Q3 operating profit of $2.8 billion (KRW 3.82 trillion), up a whopping 146 percent from last year’s third quarter, while net profits more than doubled to $2.4 billion (KRW 3.3 trillion). At the same time, the operating profit margin reached 9.3 percent, more than double the 4.1 percent recorded in the previous year.
Mind you, these results are for the company as a whole, including the internal combustion-engined side of things, but electric cars were credited by Hyundai as being one of the reasons behind its expansion, along with higher sales for SUVs and Genesis models. In total, the Korean car group sold almost 169,000 electrified vehicles, including hybrid and all-electric, which is a 33 percent increase from last year.
With such a good previous quarter, Hyundai Motor is chugging away with its expansion plans that will see the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands offer as many as 31 EVs by 2030. Sales are expected to further increase in the coming quarters, including for battery-powered cars, and the company doesn’t see major production cuts as it moves forward.
By comparison, Ford and General Motors, which are considered two of the biggest players in the automotive industry, announced that they’ll delay or abandon some of their EV production goals citing a slowdown in EV adoption, slowing sales growth, rising labor costs, and a bleak economic outlook.
Ford’s Model E business unit, which is responsible for EVs, pushed back the goal of producing 600,000 battery-powered vehicles to next year, while General Motors abandoned its 400,000-unit EV production run rate from 2022 through mid-2024.
“We do not plan to dramatically reduce EV production or our line-up due to likely near-term hurdles as we believe EV sales will grow longer term,” Seo Gang Hyun, Hyundai Motor’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, told analysts at the company’s earnings briefing, according to Reuters.
By the end of the decade, the Korean automaker aims to increase its yearly EV output to 1.51 million in its home country, while on the global stage, Hyundai wants to see 3.64 million battery-powered vehicles roll off its production lines during the same time frame.
In the long term, it wants to become one of the world’s top three electric car producers. To make this happen, Hyundai Motor Group will spend some $18.2 billion (KRW 24 trillion) until 2030 to ramp up production and bring new models such as the Hyundai Ioniq 7 and Kia EV9 to the market.

"Used Electric Vehicle Prices Plummet, Sales Overtake Most New Models",https://insideevs.com/news/692585/used-ev-prices-lowest-since-2021/,"The used EV market has matured, and it has now surpassed new sales for all models except the Tesla Model Y.",2023-10-22 09:35:14,"Despite production challenges and a charging network that often still leaves a lot to be desired, the used electric car market is booming. Used EV sales in the first half of 2023 surpassed the majority of new EV sales, according to the latest market report from battery health and data startup Recurrent.
The company reports that in the first half of 2023, 140,000 used EVs were sold in the U.S.; that's more than even the total number of new Tesla Model 3s that were sold in the same time period if you can believe it. For context, a total of 200,520 new Model Ys are believed to have been sold in the first half of 2023.
In terms of other new EVs sold in the first six months of 2023, we have the Chevrolet Bolt coming in next at 33,659 units, followed by the Rivian R1T at 16,452 units and the Volkswagen ID.4 at 16,448 units. In other words, Tesla is still dominating the used EV market as well as the new one in the U.S.
""Used EV sales, as a segment, now dwarf the sales of every new EV model besides Tesla Model Y and 3,"" Recurrent said in its latest analysis of the situation. Moreover, ""the used EV market is more affordable than any time in the past 2.5 years, while the mix of vehicles favors newer, longer-range models than ever before.""
All of this is good news for consumers looking to purchase used EVs, as their prices are at their lowest since the start of 2021 and availability appears to be increasing. The average price of a used EV is now $27,800 in the US, falling 32 percent year-over-year. And Tesla has likely influenced this trend. The average price of a used Tesla Model 3 has decreased by more than $9,000 since 2021.
Several factors have contributed to the growth of used EV sales. For starters, the used EV inventory has grown threefold over the past three years, increasing from 11,000 vehicles in April 2021 to over 33,000 today. The share of pure EVs in this inventory has grown from 55 percent in 2021 to 73 percent today. The rest are plug-in hybrids.
Thirty percent of used EVs also qualify for the $4,000 federal clean vehicle credit, and obtaining the credit is about to become easier. From Jan. 1, 2024, customers will be able to transfer EV credits to a car dealer, lowering the vehicle’s purchase price instead of waiting till they file their tax returns the following year.
If you’re worried most used EVs are clunky old cars with degraded batteries, that’s probably not the case. Nearly 30 percent of cars in this inventory are less than two years old, and 45 percent of used EVs are three years old or newer. Yes, EV batteries degrade over time, but some owners have reported how the degradation rate can be negligible, even after clocking over 100,000 miles.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X early this year that Tesla batteries last between 300,000-500,000 miles or 1,500 charge cycles. Most Model 3 and Model Y variants get a warranty of eight years or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, provided that the battery capacity retention is over 70 percent – many owners have reported over 90 percent of battery capacity retention after 100,000 miles.
The developments indicate a positive outlook for the used EV market in the US as they seem on track to become more affordable and accessible to a broader segment of the population in the coming months and years.

The Electric Vehicle Class of 2019 Shows How Far We’ve Come,https://insideevs.com/news/692515/ev-class-of-2019-range-prices/,"If you think EV tech and adoption aren't moving fast enough, just look at where we are now vs. four years ago.",2023-10-20 15:25:23,"Given the way Tesla alone has dominated so many headlines in recent years, it almost feels like electric vehicles have been an integral part of the industry for a long time. The truth is that modern EVs are still largely in their infancy. But this technology is moving incredibly fast. Just look at what was available a mere four years ago compared to now.
I call it “The Class of ‘19.” Back then, only 16 battery-electric vehicles were available for purchase in the U.S. market. Three were Teslas and the other 13 were from various legacy brands, including the Nissan Leaf, Volkswagen e-Golf, Fiat 500e, plus a few that have even managed to stick around today, like the Chevrolet Bolt and Jaguar I-Pace. But most of them were far different from today's EVs. And this suggests a rate of change that, if anything, will accelerate through at least the end of this decade.
To put things in context, it should be mentioned that battery-electric vehicles are both an extremely young technology and one of the oldest technologies in the industry. As the budding auto industry transitioned from the 19th century into the 20th, the market had not decided whether internal combustion engines would win the battle over the electric vehicles that were so prominent as the industry began. Ironically, the electric-powered self-starter turned the tide in favor of internal combustion engines, a tide that has yet to ebb.
Despite General Motors' attempt to shake things up with the mid-1990s GM EV1, no battery-electric vehicle raised its head as a viable consumer product until nascent Tesla (née Tesla Motors) had the temerity to market the Tesla Roadster in 2008. Soon after, Nissan got into the fray with the Leaf hatchback.
The Leaf, rather than the Tesla Roadster, set the pattern for EV 1.0. Automakers took the cheapest cars they had, typically subcompact hatchbacks, and swapped out their engines for expensive battery-electric powertrains. Most were adapted from ICE platforms; even the Leaf, innovative as it was, had an architecture derived from one used on cars like the Nissan Cube.
Among the 1.0 crowd were the Ford Focus EV, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Kia Soul EV. For these EVs, carmakers adopted a ""commuter philosophy."" Take the most affordable battery and stuff it into the cheapest car to keep the price down. They're not going to go very far, so they've got to be cheap. They were appealing as a second or third car that saved you money at the pump.
But, of course, they weren't that cheap in the context of the overall market because ICE versions of those cars, which did not require expensive battery packs, were (and are) less expensive to manufacture. The e-Golf, for example, started at $32,790, over $10,000 above the base Golf that year. Range wasn’t amazing back then, either; the average driving distance of the non-Tesla cars we looked at back then was about 165 miles, with a high of 258 miles with the Kona EV down to 84 miles with the 500e.
The EV Class of ’19 was filled with vehicles like that. So, four years later, how has EV 1.0 worked out? By the numbers, not all that well. Of those 13 non-Tesla EVs in the market in 2019, only a handful of models remain in the market today. Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona EV have entered a new and improved generation, but the exact futures of the Leaf, Bolt and I-Pace seem unclear. On the other hand, all three Tesla models available in 2019 are still on the market today. (More on those in a bit.)
So how were the Teslas able to survive when the first EVs from established manufacturers have largely vanished?
Tesla turned the industry on its ear with the Roadster, but even more with the 2012 debut of the Tesla Model S. The latter introduction was the beginning of EV 2.0. Instead of creating electric vehicles to comply with regulations, Tesla postulated an electric vehicle could be a tech product that is fast, sexy and fun – a completely different mindset. It's a top-down approach, playing up to the strongest attributes of EVs rather than making an attempt to hide them.
The approach continues to work well for Tesla, accounting for the continued success of its three models among the EV Class of ’19. It also spawned EV 2.0 competitors, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the GMC Hummer EV SUT. Following in the footsteps of upstart Tesla, established automakers chose some of their best-recognized names for their EV 2.0 round of vehicles.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E conjures smoking tires, burnouts, and high performance. It’s an SUV, because that is the most popular vehicle type, but it has the Mustang name and all the brand attributes associated with it. Among those qualities are fun, speed and tech—very different than EV 1.0.
While this might seem very familiar, as recently as the start of the pandemic, none of this was true. In 2019, the electric vehicle segment consisted of cheap EVs and Teslas.
Aging vehicles like the Tesla Model S, Model X and Model 3 – three Class of '19 survivors – have withstood the onslaught of newer EVs not only because of their intrinsic attributes but also because Tesla's management was prescient enough to understand that marketing EVs required more than simply good products. It also required building a charging infrastructure, the famed Tesla Supercharger network, to support those vehicles.
The reliability and ubiquity of the Tesla Superchargers has been so consistently strong that when considering an EV, many consumers only think of Tesla. The charging network enables Tesla owners to drive across the country without concerns about charging. At the same time, the rest of the automakers rely on a third-party system to create the infrastructure charging network which has not worked out very well for most consumers. In fact, the vast majority of manufacturers have now announced plans to adopt Tesla’s charging standard and protocol, the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, to address this competitive gap.
Another Tesla innovation is continual vehicle updates, the majority delivered over the air. Tesla can and does make significant changes to vehicles already in customers' hands. Some changes are frivolous, but others are substantive. Tesla customers have the sense that when they buy the vehicle, it has the potential to get better and not worse over time, and that breeds a lot of excitement and energy.
Today, the EV landscape is quite different from 2019. There are now 44 non-Teslas in the Class of '23. Adding Tesla's four current models, the full Class of '23 stands at 48. And that number is rapidly expanding. The compact utility segment has the largest roster of entries, but diversification has begun in earnest. The Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV SUT are battery-electric pickups. The recently announced Volvo EX90 and soon-to-appear Kia EV9 are three-row battery-electric EVs. Exciting as that is, the diversification hasn't really scratched the surface yet.
It’s not just availability either. Electric range has drastically improved since then. A simple average for non-Tesla EVs on sale in the U.S. today is 250 miles. The shortest ranges are Mazda MX-30 at 100 and Mini Cooper SE at 114, while the Lucid Air is the king of the pack at 433. Tesla averages 318 miles of range today.
It won't be long until we see EV models in nearly every current vehicle segment. We've now crossed that line from the regulation-compliance cars of EV 1.0 to the performance-tech-driven vehicles of EV 2.0. In the next step in the evolution EVs will offer the price mentality of EV 1.0 while delivering some of the size, drivability, and amenities of EV 2.0. The industry will close the circle in EV 3.0. Those purpose-built EVs will include many models priced and equipped for the masses as the industry offers EVs for consumers in all walks of life.
Just imagine: Where will we be four years from now?

"Stellantis Pro One Business Unit Announced, Three Electrified Pickup Trucks Due By 2026",https://www.motor1.com/news/692157/stellantis-pro-one-business-unit/,One of them will have a hybrid powertrain.,2024-12-25 07:32:46,"Earlier this month, Stellantis announced plans to hold the ""Commercial Vehicles Ambition Day"" on October 23 to outline its plans pretraining to vans and trucks. In the lead-up to the event scheduled for next Monday, the automotive conglomerate is announcing Stellantis Pro One – the new name of its light commercial vehicle (LCV) business unit. It bundles no fewer than six brands: Citroën, Fiat, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall.
Come Monday, Stellantis Pro will unveil a new van lineup for all six brands. Considering the Fiat Ducato has been spied testing recently, as shown below, we might get to see the updated large van and its many rebadged versions: Ram ProMaster, Opel Movano, Vauxhall Movano, Peugeot Boxer, and Citroën Jumper. Speaking of the ProMaster, Stellantis says the EV version will be officially introduced later this year.
The newly founded business unit intends to launch four electrified pickups over the next two years. The Ram 1500 REV is one of them, along with a hydrogen-powered pickup. These future models are part of an updated lineup of vans and trucks in North America that will be gradually rolled out in the coming years. Stellantis Pro One is promising a greener lineup courtesy of a second-generation electric drivetrain with a longer range and the hydrogen fuel cell setup we mentioned earlier.
The LCV sector is of massive importance for Stellantis since it accounts for a third of its net revenues. It sold 1.6 million units last year, but LCV boss Jean-Philippe Imparato admits ""we have still to do some homework"" to beat Ford Pro. The head honcho went on to say the compact vans such as the Citroën Berlingo, Fiat Doblo, Peugeot Partner, Opel Combo, and Vauxhall Combo will all be renewed in 2024 when the midsize Opel Vivaro, Vauxhall Vivaro, Peugeot Expert, and the Fiat Scudo will be updated as well.

Federal Tax Incentives To More Than Double US EV Sales By 2030: Analysis,https://www.motor1.com/news/691949/ira-more-than-double-ev-sales-2030/,Demand for lithium should be 15 percent higher in the United States in 2035 thanks to the US Inflation Reduction Act.,2024-12-25 07:32:48,"The landscape of the American automotive industry has been evolving rapidly in recent months, and that's largely driven by the multifaceted impacts of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This legislation, signed into law in August 2022, has had a profound effect on various sectors, particularly electric vehicles and the lithium industry. According to a new analysis, impacts from the IRA will boost the outlook for electric vehicle sales in the country by 2030 to more than double the pre-IRA forecast.
In 2023, the US is forecasted to sell over 1.3 million combined battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids, which will mark a 52-percent increase over last year. S&P Global’s latest analysis predicts that by 2030, plug-in sales are projected to skyrocket to over 6 million annually. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of these vehicles will be fully electric, which are now expected to surpass 4.6 million by the end of the decade and that is more than double the initial forecast of around 2 million units. That would put extra stress on the grid infrastructure, though.
""Given the forecasted increase in EV sales, electricity load is expected to increase, reaching 83 TWh by 2030,"" Suzanna Massingue, low carbon transportation analyst with S&P Global, comments. ""In addition to the increase in forecasted vehicle sales, a larger proportion of these will be fully electric vehicles, generating a higher electricity demand. It is widely recognized that an upgrade of the power grid will be required to ensure the charging network can support the intended sales growth.""
The Impacts Of IRA So Far:
The US Inflation Reduction Act has played a pivotal role in boosting the adoption of electric vehicles. One of its most significant contributions is the system of production and consumer tax credits, which have stimulated the production of critical minerals and the supply of battery components within the US and its free-trade agreement partners. As a result, companies have allocated substantial funds to explore lithium deposits within the country, positioning the US as one of the leaders in the search for this essential component of lithium-ion batteries.
The IRA will not only fuel the EV adoption but also trigger a renaissance in the American lithium industry. One notable aspect of this revival is the growing interest in exploring lithium deposits in the United States. In 2022, companies allocated more funds to lithium exploration in the US than any other country, with the highest level of investment in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. As a result, post-IRA US energy transition demand for lithium is projected to be 15 percent higher by 2035 than it would have been in a pre-IRA scenario.
Data from Market Intelligence shows that the total lithium exploration budget in the US, which holds the second-largest lithium reserves and resources globally, reached $93.5 million in 2022, a significant increase from $48.4 million in 2021. These developments in the EV and lithium industries have had a noticeable impact on the market. Lithium prices, which reached all-time highs in late 2022, have since seen a significant decrease.
As a reminder, the US Inflation Reduction Act is a significant piece of legislation signed into law in August 2022 with the primary goal of addressing inflation and stimulating economic growth in the United States. This comprehensive act is designed to have far-reaching effects on the American economy, impacting various sectors and individuals across the nation.

European Declaration On Cycling To Stimulate Bicycle Industry In Europe,https://insideevs.com/news/691774/european-declaration-cycling-unveiled/,The EU wants to accelerate the widespread use of bicycles for urban mobility.,2023-10-18 08:44:55,"In Europe, bicycles, both electric and muscle-powered, have gained quite a lot of popularity, especially when it comes to the urban mobility sector. A lot of cities across Europe have been adopting a more cycling-focused approach, encouraging their citizens to ditch their cars for quick trips around the city. Indeed, the benefits of cycling are tenfold, and the EU is taking cycling seriously. Very seriously.
The European Commissioner for Transport recently unveiled the European Declaration on Cycling, a program with both long and short term goals designed to unlock the full potential that cycling has to offer. The declaration lays the groundwork for future legislation around cycling, with a total of 36 principles aimed at advancing cycling in the European Union.
The European Union emphasizes the sustainable and accessible nature of cycling, highlighting the benefits making the shift to two wheels has not only to an individual’s health, but also to society and the economy. At present, nearly all European cities have bicycle-focused infrastructure that allows both bicycle and electric bicycles riders to enjoy a safe and efficient experience. The EU’s new declaration looks to boost this even further, and hopes to “enhance bicycle mobility” even more.
Among the key measures of the declaration include improving cycling infrastructure, and making bikes more easily integrated with other means of transportation such as buses and trains. In total, there are 36 principles in the European Declaration on Cycling (all of which can be viewed in the official document linked below), covering the bases from infrastructure development, increased investments in the cycling industry, bike-focused tourism, and improving data collection.
Speaking of the cycling industry, the European Commissioner for Transport, Adina Vălean, sees huge potential in the cycling industry, as it presents Europe with the opportunity of more high-quality jobs particularly in training and cycling tourism. “This Declaration recognizes cycling as one of the most sustainable, accessible and inclusive, least expensive and healthiest modes of transport and leisure, as well as its central importance for European society and the economy,” Vălean told French e-mobility publication Clean Rider.
At present, there are some pretty high hopes for the e-bike industry, as well as the cycling industry in general. In Germany, for example, e-bikes are expected to overtake regular bicycles in terms of sales volumes in 2023. On top of that, by 2030, the global e-bike industry is expected to surpass $120 billion.

Europe: E-Bikes Categorized As Bicycles Not Motor Vehicles,https://insideevs.com/news/691544/europe-ebikes-classified-bicycles-not-motor-vehicles/,The EU Court of Justice's recent ruling exempts e-bike riders from the stringent insurance requirements of motor vehicle users.,2023-10-16 08:55:18,"It's no secret that the micromobility industry has its fair share of haters. Quite a few of my articles covering debuts of new electric bicycles are met with comments classifying them as electric motorcycles as against to electric bicycles. While it's easy to see where these comments are coming from, it's important to note that there's a difference between e-bikes and electric motorcycles, and even e-mopeds. A big one.
A recent ruling by the EU Court of Justice was just released which officially classifies electric bicycles as bicycles, and not motor vehicles. Technically speaking, electric bicycles, at least in Europe, are not allowed to have throttle-only modes, and can only be motorized as the cyclist cranks at the pedals. This lies at the very core of the ruling: e-bikes are classified as bicycles because they require the rider to pedal. Meanwhile, motor vehicles must be propelled exclusively by their motor.
An article by Forbes highlights that the root of this debate lies in an e-bike accident in Bruges, Belgium, where an e-bike rider was killed in an accident with a car. The case was then referred to the EU Court of Justice who finally determined that the individual on the e-bike was entitled to compensation as a ""vulnerable road user"" instead of a regular motor vehicle. The latter stipulates much less compensation as the former.
The EU Court of Justice's ruling means that e-bike riders are exempted from motor vehicle insurance in Europe – something that's a prerequisite for car drivers and motorcycle riders. On top of that, the court ruled that e-bikes are ""incapable of causing damage comparable to motorcycles or cars."" Of course, this isn't to say that e-bikes are super safe means of mobility. In Europe, e-bikes are limited to nominal outputs of 250 watts, and aren't allowed to provide any assistance at speeds in excess of 25 kilometers per hour (15 miles an hour).
All that being said, e-bike rules and regulations in the US are much more relaxed. In fact, a wide selection of e-bikes sold in the US produce power upwards of 500 watts, and a lot of them come standard with a thumb throttle. In such cases, the EU Court of Justice's ruling seems to be inapplicable. At present, Class 1 and 2 e-bikes have a federally mandated top speed of 20 miles per hour on motor power alone, while Class 3 e-bikes have a limited top speed of 28 miles per hour.
At the end of the day, regardless of where in the world you're from, it's always best to err on the side of caution. E-bike insurance remains a good idea against theft and accident damage. On top of that, wearing protective gear, not least of which is a certified helmet, may not be required just yet, but there's nothing to lose when it comes to safety.

Commercial E-Cargo Bikes Picking Up Steam In Urban Setting,https://insideevs.com/news/691283/commerical-ebike-delivery-services-prove-efficient/,UK’s Man Maid claims that its cargo e-bikes are 10 times faster than delivery vans in the city.,2023-10-13 14:06:38,"Electric bicycles have proven their worth when it comes to getting from point A to B in the urban setting. That said, they’ve gone beyond simple personal mobility, and are now proving to be essential tools for business to deliver products and services. For the longest time, delivery businesses – be it for products or services – have relied on bulky vans that can easily get stuck in traffic.
The advent of electric bicycles, particularly those designed to haul heavy cargo, is vastly changing the last-mile delivery industry. Indeed, several times before, we’ve talked about a lot of companies making the shift to e-mobility. Brands like Zoomo and even Ikea are incorporating e-bikes into their fleet of delivery vehicles in order to better keep up with the demands of folks living in the urban setting.
In the UK, for instance, Man Maid, a handyman service that offers home-service plumbing, carpentry, electrical, and other home essentials, has been seeing quite a lot of success with the use of its fleet of electric cargo bikes. Man Maid’s founder, Mungo Morgan, explained to cycling publication E-Bike Tips that switching to electric bicycles has increased the company’s operating speed and efficiency by a significant margin. In fact, he states that e-bikes are “10 times quicker than a van” when it comes to providing services within the city. Here’s a video of one of the e-bike-riding service providers navigating through the busy city.
Yet another clear benefit of this is that the company reportedly saves up to £7,000, or about $8,500 USD, in parking tickets per year when compared to using traditional delivery vans. This makes perfect sense, as e-bikes are much smaller than even the smallest of vans, and can pretty much be parked anywhere – even the driveway (or walkway) of a small house or cottage. As for the speedy service, e-bikes get to skip the queues at stoplights and traffic, as a lot of the time, they get their own paths where cars and vans are not allowed to drive through.
At the end of the day, efficiency is key when it comes to the logistics industry, and it’s interesting to see companies big and small integrating electric bicycles into their fleets of delivery vehicles. Of course, big vans and trucks still have their place when it comes to transporting goods across long distances, but when it comes to the hectic maze that is the urban jungle, compact e-bikes reign supreme.
